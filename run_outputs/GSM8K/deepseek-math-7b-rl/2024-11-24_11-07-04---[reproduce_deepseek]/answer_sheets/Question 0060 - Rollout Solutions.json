Since there are 25 oranges in total, then the number of unripe oranges would be 20/100 * 25 = 5 . And also two oranges are sour. Then this means up until now , these three types account for either at least : Bad(one), Unripe(five)+Sour(two)= eight oranges or less than twenty seven since other ones could potentially turn into any type namely Good Oranges as well..
