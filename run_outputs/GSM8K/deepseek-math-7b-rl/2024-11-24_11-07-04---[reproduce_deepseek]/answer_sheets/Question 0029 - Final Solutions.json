Condition 1:  One pair of shoes (the \"heels\") costs $33. Condition 2: The second pair of shoes (also called 'heels') costs twice as much as the first pair - so it costs 2 * $33 = $66. Condition 3: Both pairs of shoes combined therefore cost $33 + $66 = $99. Condition 4: These two pairs of shoes altogether would amount to $5 less than what the boots cost; we can write this condition down mathematically as: BootCost = ShoeTotal + $5 or BootCost - ShoeTotal = $5 Substituting in numbers where applicable gives us our equation: BootCost - $99= $5 Solving for BootsCost involves adding $99 to both sides of the same equation: BootCost = $99 + $5 This simplifies further to...BootCost = $104 So....The boots must cost $104!", "ost_step": {"1": "Given one pair of shoes (the \"heels\") costs $33.", "2": "The second pair of shoes (also called 'heels') costs twice as much as the first pair - so it costs 2 * $33 = $66."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Both pairs of shoes togethercost $33+$66=$99.$99$5$=$$104$.Therefore,$104is$\\boxed{correct}$.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
