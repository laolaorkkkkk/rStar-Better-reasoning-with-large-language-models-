Condition 1: 1 bag of chips contains 250 calories per serving. Condition 2: A 300g bag contains 5 servings. Therefore, one serving = (300/5) g = 60g. Since it provides 250 calories per serving i.e.,one portion size=60*calories_per_serving , or simply multiply weight(in gm)/servings * cal/serving -> so we get :portion size=(60)*(250/5)= 300 cals . So this means eating whole bag would amount to consuming ~1500 cals because as calculated above One Bag yields~ 1500 Cals [300cals x 5 portions]. But u r only allowed to intake 2000 - 1800 = 200 cals worth of food on any given day...so calculate what proportion of the diet u must adhere too..i.e.,allowed cals / Total Cal in a bag =(200/1500) which simplifies to around(.13). Multiply this further by Weight of the whole bag gives you final ans -->{bagwt}*.13=~ 4grams ! Thats how much u could munch on ur daily walk!
