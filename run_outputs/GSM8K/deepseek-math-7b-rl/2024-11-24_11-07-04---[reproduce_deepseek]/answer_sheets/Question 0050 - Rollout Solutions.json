We know from first condition that if you multiply A (the average), times 7 days then you get total number of eggs for one week denoted by W. Mathematically speaking, we can write down the following equation: $7*A=W$.", "2": "Second condition tells us about calculation of `weekly earning` denoted by E. It says: take total number of eggs W divided by 12, then multiply the result by 2 dollars. In other words, the Weekly Earning E would be: $((W)/12)*$2 $. Since we already know that $W=7*A$, then we can write down the following equation instead: $((7A)/12)*2=E$. Simplifying it further gives us: $(14A)/12=E$, or $7A/6=E$. This means our goal is to find value of unknown A (variable).", "3": "As per second condition let us replace W by its known value 7A. Hence we have: $\\frac{((7A)/12)*2}{}=E \\Rightarrow \\frac{(14A)}{12} = E.$ Solving this equation for variable A gives us:$ A=\\frac{{12E}}{14}$. But we are asked for finding Weekly Earning E so let keep A in terms of E as much as possible. No calculations needed at this point because we don't have value of E yet! Remember the target of this section was obtaining A interms of E only but not calculating any numerical value unless otherwise stated. Last thing to check for correctness was done in previous steps.
