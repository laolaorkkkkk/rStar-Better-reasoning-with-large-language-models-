Given this information, if you multiply nine seconds * (2 / 3), then it would equal six because 9 x (2 / 3) equals 6. This means that James slumbered on his side for six continuous hours one night. Step 2: Next subtract Jame\u2019s slumber duration away from harry's; Ie., take off james seven hour sleep record form Harrfys overnight stay at eight our peroid so ,we get : Nine minus Six resulting into Three straight hours .So therefore Harriy Slept For Tree Hours Longer Than Jim Es", "2": "To solve this problem, first calculate how long James slept by taking 2/3 of what Harry slept. Since Harry slept 9 hours, James slept 2/3*9 = 6 hours. Then compare the difference between their sleeping durations by subtracting the length of time James slept from the length of time Harry slept. That is 9-6=3 hours. So Harry slept 3 hours longer than James.
