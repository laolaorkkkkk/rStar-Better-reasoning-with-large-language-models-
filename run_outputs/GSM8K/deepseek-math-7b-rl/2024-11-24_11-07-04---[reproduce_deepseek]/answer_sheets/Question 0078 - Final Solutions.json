Answer : Always simplify when dealing with complex math expressions containing multiple operations. Step 3: Simplifying Expressions Involving Fractions We often encounter mathematical expressions with several operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and roots. When simplifying such expressions, we must adhere to the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Let us consider two examples Example 1: Evaluate the expression $$\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}$$ Solution: According to the order of operations, we perform multiplication before addition or subtraction. Hence, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together to get \\[\\frac{2 \\times 3}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{6}{12}.\\] This fraction simplifies further by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6 here.

Answer : Always simplify when dealing with complex math expressions containing multiple operations. Step 3: Simplifying Expressions Involving Fractions We often encounter mathematical expressions with several operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and roots. When simplifying such expressions, we must adhere to the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). Let us consider two examples Example 1: Evaluate the expression $$\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}$$ Solution: According to the order of operations, we perform multiplication before addition or subtraction. Hence, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together to get \\[\\frac{2 \\times 3}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{6}{12}.\\] This fraction simplifies further by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6 here.
