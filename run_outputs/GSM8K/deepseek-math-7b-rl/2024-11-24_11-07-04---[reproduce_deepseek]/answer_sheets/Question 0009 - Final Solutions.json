Over time means working any additional hours beyond the standard 40 hours.

Therefore, her overtime earnings could be found as follows: Overtime Earnings = Overtime Hours \u00d7 (1.2 * Hourly Rate) = 5 \u00d7 (1.2 \u00d7 10) = 5 \u00d7 12 = $60.\nStep 4: Finally, adding up both types of earnings would give us our final value for Eliza's total weekly earnings: Weekly Earning = Regular Earnings + Overtime Earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.So, Ella made $\\$460$.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10.
