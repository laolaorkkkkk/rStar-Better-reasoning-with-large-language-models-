However remember we only started counting this at six people transacted with us! We still need add what happens as our remaining three folks come through... oh look it says nothing happened here!. That means no additional discs got sold off beyond just those first nine purchases described above; therefore said amount remains unaltered--namely having rung up precisely 'seven'. Thus if you simply want me giving digits without requiring further explanation then I can tell right away ...that same exact count applies equally well when considering ALL TEN consumers came thru shop too because none DID make any sorta purchase during their visitings either!!! Correcting Mistake Initially made mistake while calculating sixth point ie fifth plus Sixth values weren\u2019T added instead kept constant since zero was mentioned .so adding value correctly : In fact ,when carrying calculation forward seventh transaction adds another One disc(one customer purchased one dvd )making totalsells reach twelve rather than sevensince i failedtoadd earlier calculated amounts before moving onto new part !
