Then, we divide this total by the number of months to get the monthly payment.\n\nSheila bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost without interest is 5 * $150 = $750.\nAn interest charge of 2% on the total purchase is calculated as follows: 2/100 * $750 = $15. Therefore, adding the interest makes the total loan sum $750 + $15 = $765.\nSince this amount needs to be repaid over 3 months, the monthly payment is $765 / 3 = $255.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
