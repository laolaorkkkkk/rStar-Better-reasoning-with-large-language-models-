According to condition 2, if you take 25% (or 0.25) off the original price x, what remains is equal to the discounted price ($19.50). We express this relationship mathematically as an equation: \\boxed{x\\times(1-0.25)=$19.5}. This simplifies to: \\(0.75x=$19.5\\). To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75 \\[x=\\frac{$19.5}{0.75", "subanswer": {"text": "}= $26.\\]Therefore, the original price of the book was $\\$26$.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "So the original price of the bookwas$\\$$26 .", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
