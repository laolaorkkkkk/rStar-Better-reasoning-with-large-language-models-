Step 3: You continue by solving the remaining Equation,$2x+30=110$, isolate term with variable $x$ onto one side of the equation while keeping the constant terms on other side, and also remember whatever operation you do in LHS also apply to RHS so we get,$$2x=110\u221230\\Rightarrow 2x=80 \\text{and }\\!\\!|\\!\\!\\text{ divide both sides by 2}$$: $$\\frac { 2x }{ 2 } =\\frac { 80 }{ 2 } .$$ Thus, solves down to its simplest form:$$x=\\boxed{40}.$$ Hence Number of"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Gretchen found 70 Goldencoins!.
