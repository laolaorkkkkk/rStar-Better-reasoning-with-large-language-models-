Again dividing this value by the weight per toy(which remains unaltered),$\\frac{7.5}{0.5}=15$,I get back my previous result!, but only because these weights happen to work out evenly thus making mistakes less apparent until you actually attempt to solve the problem rigorously at least once. In real life though, when dealing with multiple operations and varying numbers your mistakes will likely become glaringly obvious as you will not end up with the right magnitude or unit. Always cross check your calculations especially if you are working with multiple steps and varying units.(Though in reality even a single mistake can lead to disaster, computers routinely perform arithmetic procedures on very large sets of numbers without any errors creeping in but they still have error checking systems which detect most human mistakes). Moving away from pedantry, let us proceed to our next question :)."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
