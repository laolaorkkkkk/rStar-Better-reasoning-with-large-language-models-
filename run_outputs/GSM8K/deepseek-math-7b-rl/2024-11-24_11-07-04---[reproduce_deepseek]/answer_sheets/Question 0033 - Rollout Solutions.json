We know that the sum of the number of silver (x) and gold (x+30) coins equals the total number of coins which is 110. Therefore our equation can be written as follows:\n\\[x+(x+30)=110.\\]This simplifies to \\[2x+30=110.\\]Next subtract 30 from both sides so as to isolate the term with \\(x\\) on one side: \\begin{align*}\n2x+30-30&=110-30\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2x &= 80.\n\\end{align*}Finally divide both sides by 2:\\[\\frac{2x}{2}=\\frac{80}{2}\\]so\\[\\boxed{x=40}.\\]Thus gretchen has \\[\\boxed{40+30}=70\\]gold coins .So Gertchen has $\\boxed{70}$ gold coins", "value": 0.65625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
