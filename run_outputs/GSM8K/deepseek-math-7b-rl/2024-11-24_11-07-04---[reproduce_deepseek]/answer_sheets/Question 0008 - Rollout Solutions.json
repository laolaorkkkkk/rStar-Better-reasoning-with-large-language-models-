From here it was another 80 mph stretch over t=hours until arrival back at base camp. Solve using d=rt for t:  80*t = x ; or t =x/80 . Our new equation using our known values becomes :   180+15+(30)(X/80)=D [where D=distance from start].

Traveling at a stop at 0 mph for two hours equates to 0*2=0 miles traveled during this time. Adding another .5 hours of lower speed travel at 30mph comes out to 30*.5=15 miles moved during this part of the journey. Finally, continuing on through the last hours of travel, we know it took four hours total and we've already accounted for 5.5 (3 initial plus 2 in traffic plus .5 lower speed), thus leaving 4-5.5=.5 hours of travel at 80 mph.
