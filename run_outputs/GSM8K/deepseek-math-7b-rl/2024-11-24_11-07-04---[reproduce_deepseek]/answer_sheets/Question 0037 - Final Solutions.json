Condition 1:  John has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. So the total amount of money he gets from selling legos is 13 * $15 = $195. Condition 2: He uses this money to buy 8 video games for $20 each so the total cost of the video games is 8 * $20 = $160. Condition 3: He also has $5 left. So the total amount spent on video games plus what was left equals the total amount earned from selling legos which gives us $160 + $5 = $195. We know it must equal $195 because we calculated earlier that\u2019s exactly what john got when he sold his legos (condition one).So let's set up our equation as follows; Total price paid for Video Games + Remaining Money = Total Earnings From Selling Legos or ($160+$5) =$195 This simplifies down to $165=195 But something went wrong here right!?
