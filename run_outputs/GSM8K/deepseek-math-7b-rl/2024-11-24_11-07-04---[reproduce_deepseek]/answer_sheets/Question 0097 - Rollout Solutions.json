Condition 2: \u201cEach 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes.\u201d So for every 16 ounces of tomatoes, we know it contains 3* (number of cans) = 3*(x/16) tomatoes. Condition 3: \"Freda\u2019s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.\" From condition 1, we know this corresponds to x/2 = 32 => x=64 ounces of tomatoes originally. Then using condition 2, substituting x=64 gives us the number of tomatoes used as being equal to 3 * (64 / 16) = 12 tomatoes", "ost_step": {"1": "According to condition 1, when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means if she starts with $x$ ounces of tomatoes, only $\\frac{x}{2}$ ounces of sauce result. We need to solve the equation $\\frac{x}{2} = 32$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by two yields $x = 64$, so Freda started with 64 ounces of tomatoes. Step 2: In accordance with condition 2 each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Hence, since Freda was working on batches containing $ \\frac{64}{16}=4\\text { cans}$, then he would use indeed $$3*\\left(\\frac{64}{16}\\right)=3*4=12$$as told in statement C tomatoes altogether!", "2": "As mentioned above calculating the actual value yielded no complications at all here. But why does Statement 3 actually corresponded exactly to 'the number of tomatoes'? It may seem like just luck but upon closer inspection Condition 2 directly implies that the amount of tomatoes must always be thrice the quantity of 16 oz cans divided by one can. Formulated mathematically this reads as $$\\text{# tomatoes }=3*\\left(\\frac{\\text{total # oz}}{\\text{each can size}}\\right)/\\text{(each can)}.$$As you see, everything cancels except the number of tomatoes yielding Statement 3 once again represents the correct amount of tomatoes freda employed in making her most recent sauce. Thus", "3": "There might even be a way to avoid the calculations entirely by simply thinking about what the situation entails. Lets assume Freda purchased $n$ cans of tomatoes ($16oz$ each), hence she bought $16n$ oz worth of tomatoes. By Condition 1 these got reduced by half hence we end up with $8n$ oz of sauce. But we also know from condition 1 that the resulting sauce equals thirty-two oz. thus setting equality yields $8n=32$; solving for n immediately gives our previous result $n=\\frac{32}{8}=4.$ Whatever method one employs though clearly statements condition 2 & 3 contain sufficient information to determine the unique value of the unknown!", "4": "Answer : Given"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
