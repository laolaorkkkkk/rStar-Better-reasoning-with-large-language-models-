Our Answer!", "3": "To confirm above calculation let us setup another equation following same logic but expressing thingfromthe other side & check if result agrees with former method..what if we said , $\\text{RemaningPieces}$ $=(TotalPieces_{available@start})-(TakenPieCount)$ ..since we defined TakenPicecount\u00a0as taking away\u00a0(or subtracting) some quantities from total . From this perspective if we substitute values we get new equation....$(14)=(40)-x$ or equivalently ....take your pick ! $ x=(40)-(14)$. Both ways lead to the same solution i.e.$x=26\\Pi$. Amazing right !! Thats because both methods use same underlying principle. As long as you treat algebra symbol such as (-) as a verb describing subtractive action rather than as something to simply evaluate do the operations in any order you like! Youll always end up at the same place. For future reference, remember that algebraic expressions can often be read in different ways, but as long as the expression is always true, this flexibility is a good thing. It allows you to choose the most convenient way to solve the problem.
