This value goes into our first term. There are no other bonuses mentioned here, so our equation is now 1200 = TotalDamage. Because the variable is already isolated, you can move on to the next step. You need to know how close you are to reaching the dragon, so you subtract the maximum distance the dragon can be harmed from the TotalDamage: DamageLimit - TotalDamage = DistanceFromDragon. Plugging in the numbers, this is 1000 - 1200 = -200...but distances can't be negative! That means something went wrong somewhere. Let\u2019s reread the problem carefully and look again at our set up. We calculated the maximum throwing distance correctly, but then subtracted the maximum harming distance from that. Instead, let's reverse the order of our subtraction. Doing this gives us TotalDamage - DamageLimit = DistanceFromDragon, or 1200 - 1000 = 200 As a positive number, this result makes sense--it represents the number of feet beyond the dragon's dangerous radius where Polly can still hit the dragon with her golden javelin if she holds the emeralded amulet.
