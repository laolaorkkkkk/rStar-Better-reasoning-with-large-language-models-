This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?", "ost_step": {"1": "We know Kyle paid $19.50 for the book, but this represents only 75% of the original price because it includes a 25% discount. Let's call the original price P. Then we can write down the equation $19.50=0.75P$.", "2": "To solve for P, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75 so as not to change its validity. That means $\\frac{19.50}{0.75}= \\frac{0.75P}{0.75}$, or simply solving on right hand side yields $P=\\frac{19.50}{0.75} = \\$26$. Hence the original price must have been $26 dollars.", "3": "Thus our solution is complete; therefore ,theoriginalpriceofthebookwas$26"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Yes, you guessed correctly! Therefore the answer is indeed $26\\$.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
