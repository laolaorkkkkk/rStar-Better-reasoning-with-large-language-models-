We know that buying the electronics gadgets results in a future value of $8096 versus a future value of only $5125 for the jewelry. Therefore, choosing to buy the electronics gadgets will yield a greater return because its future value ($8096) is greater than the future value of the jewelry alternative ($5125).To see how much better off the investor could potentially be by selecting the right option instead of the wrong one, simply subtract the smaller value from the larger one:$$8096 - 5125 = \\$2971.$$Therefore, the potential additional profit realized by being strategic about which investment to make is $2971.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
