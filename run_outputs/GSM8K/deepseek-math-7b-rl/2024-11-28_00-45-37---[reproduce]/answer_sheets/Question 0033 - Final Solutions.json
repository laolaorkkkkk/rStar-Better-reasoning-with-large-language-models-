According to the hint, the number of gold coins (denoted as `G`) is `S + 30`. The total number of coins is the sum of the number of silver and gold coins, which means `S + G = 110`. Substituting `G` with `S + 30`, we get `S + (S + 30) = 110`. This simplifies to `2S + 30 = 110`. Subtracting 30 from both sides yields `2S = 80`. Dividing through by 2 finally provides `S = 40`: this tells us that Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find out how many gold coins she has, substitute `S = 40` into the expression for `G`: thus, `G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70`. Therefore, Gretchen has indeed 70 golden coins!", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the number of silver coins and gold coins is equal to 110. Therefore, we can write the following equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.\nNext, we want to isolate the term with x, so we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 80.\nFinally, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x: x = 40.\nTherefore, Gertzen has 40 silver coins and since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.", "value": 0.71875}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
