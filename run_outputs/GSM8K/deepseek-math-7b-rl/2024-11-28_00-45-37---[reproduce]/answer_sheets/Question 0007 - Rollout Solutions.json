This means up until that point Carla must still owe us for all remaining time taken once again plus another additional twenty minutes added onto account as lost due to system update reboot actions...which totals [(remaining amount needed)-current progress]/(rate being used currently)=[(total size)-(already processed)]/(download speed).
