As per question OC i.e.original cost is $150*5=$750; No Charge (Cg)is mentioned apart from the stated fact its a three monthly instalment deal thus making it easy we can solve without considering Cg factor..As simple as A=A ..henceforth mathematically TP= $750.Now comes Interest part ...Its not direct formula based ,but if you know what percentage is then I guess you can apply the same concept. In this scenario Its 2% on the entire TP... therefore the interest incurred is =(2/100)*750=$15--This is the total interest over the two year duration. As the payments are made in 3 equal installments ,we divide this interst amt by 3 --thus giving us $5.---(Its not exactly relevant to the current scenario though but"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how much Sheila will pay each month for 3 months, we first need to determine the total cost including the interest.
