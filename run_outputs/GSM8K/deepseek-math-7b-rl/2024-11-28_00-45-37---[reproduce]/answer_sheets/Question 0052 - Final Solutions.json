This equals approximately 7.5 lbs worth of comics removed once multiplied together. Then subtract these weights against an initial target removal goal leaving us needing another ~7lbs.. We then divide .5(the toy units per item)/weight needed=number of items required => ? =7/.5=>14.? Finally double check your work by making sure both amounts", "subanswer": {"text": "Of course! Let me fix my mistake... Okay I fixed now should make sense though", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To solve this problem, we first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah wants to remove. Each comic weighs 1/4 pound and he plans to remove 30 of them. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is 30*(1/4)=7.5 pounds.\nSince Uriah needs to reduce the weight of his backpack by 15 pounds, the remaining amount of weight that can come from removing toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs half a pound, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 10}]
