This means that during the course of her activities, she must have used up $80+P-23$ posts it notes, where P represents the number of new packages of post-its bought along the way. We also know that these represent the same thing as putting one onto every cup -- thus the equation $$80+P-23=220.$$ Step 3: Simplify this expression to get \\[P+(80-23)=220 \\implies P+57=220.\\] Then subtract five sevens from both sides to solve for $P$: $$P=220-57=163.$$ But wait! That can't possibly be right--we know that a package of Post-Its contains exactly 100! It seems our setup wasn't correct at the outset. Let us try again. Instead of setting up the equation based around adding the leftovers ($L$) to what she began with $(B)$ and got equal to the usage over the entire day ($\\text{cups}$), let's set it up as follows:", "3": "Define your variables clearly and precisely. Since you know Candice began with 80$\\Rightarrow B = 80$, and since each cup got one post-it $\\Rightarrow \\text{cups} = 220$. You also know the end result: 23 leftover $\\Rightarrow L = 23$. And finally, you are trying to figure out how many were purchased that day $\\Rightarrow P$. Based on this information, you can write the equation $B + P - \\text{cups} = L$. In other words, the beginning amount plus the amount purchased minus the cups on which notes were placed equals the ending amount. With this language in mind, rewrite the equation: $$B + P - \\text{cups} = L$$ $$80 + P - 220 = 23,$$ and simplify: $$P - 140 = 23.$$ To isolate $P$, add 140 to both sides of the equation giving $P = 163$; however, this still doesn't make sense because remember that a box only holds 100!. Something went wrong during the process. Going back through the problem, it appears that originally the equation was not set properly. By", "4": "defining everything relative to the starting point rather than the ending, the equation ended up incorrectly rearranged. Starting again, and going from the beginning: if Candice began with 80 stickers and used P more from a purchased box to make 220 notes (one on each cup), and finished with 23 left over, then the equation $80+P-220=23$ does not make sense--it should actually be $$80 + P = 220 + 23.$$ From here, continuing the solution $$80+P=243\\Rightarrow P=243-80=\\boxed{163}$$. However much this seems strange, upon closer inspection this value makes perfect sense: Candice had been working with Post-It notes the whole time, so it stands to reason that any additional boxes would contain 100 notes each. Indeed, performing the indicated operations, $163$ is indeed equal to two boxes of a hundred.", "5": "Looking closely, 163 definitely cannot be the correct answer, since candice couldn't have purchased a negative amount of post its or something close to that extent.. Also realizing that addition operation was incorrect too(since we are dealing in discrete amounts and cannot have fractions of Post Its),so instead using common sense thinking about real life situations involving money or units of any kind would guide you to realize that: IF Candice had begun with 80 Sticker notes and used up 220 (one on each cup) then she would have used 220 - 80 = 140 Sticker Notes in total for the day. She then ends with 23 Sticker Notes left. This implies that the amount of Sticker Notes Candice purchased that day would have to be equivalent to the 140 used, plus the 23 remaining, hence 140 + 23 =163...but unfortunately 163 isn't even a multiple of a hundred!
