She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it.  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much did she pay?", "ost_step": {"1": "First, Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for construction, so the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.", "2": "Then, she wants to insure this item at a cost of 10% of the total amount ($1300). To calculate this, we multiply $1300 x 10/100 = $130. This means she spent $130 on insurance.", "3": "Finally, to determine the total amount she paid, we add up all these costs; namely, $1300 (the original cost plus the additional one), plus the $130 for insurance. That sums up as follows: $1300+$130=$1430$. We can conclude that Janet paid $\\$1430$, altogether!", "4": "Henceforth ,we put our calculation into sentence form :\"She Paid \\$\\boxed{1430}$\".", "5": "And finally let us express what was obtained above mathematically,$ \\$(500+800)+0.1*(500+800)= \\\\\\$((500+800)(1+0.1))=\\\\\\$(500+800)*1.1=\\$\\boxed{1430}$.", "6": "Answer=:\\$1430\\$.
