First, let's figure out how many rubies there were if there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there were 175 diamonds, subtracting 35 would leave us with 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. Next, since the problem states that the number of emeralds was twice the number of rubies, multiplying our number of rubies (140) by 2 means there were 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds. Finally, adding together these amounts tells us the grand total of gems; combining the diamond, ruby, and emerald counts results in 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 jewels!", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
