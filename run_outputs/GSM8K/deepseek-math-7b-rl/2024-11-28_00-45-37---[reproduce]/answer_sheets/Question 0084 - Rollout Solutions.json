Then the number of games they won would be x+8 (since they won 8 more than they lost). We also know from the problem statement that the sum of wins and losses equals 22, i.e., x+(x+8) = 22. Simplifying both sides yields 2x+8=22 or equivalently 2x=14 whose solution provides us with our value for unknown variable x representing the number of losing matches; thus solving equation 2x=14 produces , meaning out teams had fourteen loses .
