Since each team consists of 5 players (boys or girls), and each school sends both a boys' team and a girls' team, then each school will send 2 teams x 5 players per team = 10 student players. Additionally, since each school sent coaches for their respective teams too, and each coach goes along with 2 teams (one boy's and one girl's) ,then each school would need to provide 2 coaches. This amounts to an additional 2 coaches per school. Adding up these numbers", "subanswer": {"text": "From one school, the total number of people sent is thus 10 student players plus 2 coaches equals 12 people per school.

Adding another member like a coach makes it 1 person plus these 10 making it 1+10 = 11 members per school. Since we have 4 such schools then our calculation would look something like this : 11 * 4 = 44 People .
