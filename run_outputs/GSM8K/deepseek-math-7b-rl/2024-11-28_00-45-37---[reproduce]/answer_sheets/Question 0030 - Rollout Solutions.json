When two numbers are in proportion their values can only be determined when the actual values are known i.e. antecedent and consequent.

Trust me its better to remember this way rather than trying to remember a common factor to multiply in order to get rid of fractions in Algebraic scenario's.....this way you can solve proportion problems without needing to know in advance a common factor...

I mean square root should also result an n digit number when multplying with itself?? And one thing i am sure about the problem is its having unique solution...that makes me feel confident enough trying my best :D Anyways.. Here goes nothing!! Consider a no xy such that when squared gives us zz as a result ...i think u got some idea till here ..now whats the simplest way to express any two digit number ?? yes its x*10 + y isn't it", "subanswer": {"text": "hence considering above representation => (x*10 +y)^2=zz=> expansion required", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Expanding ....>(x*10+y)^2=100x^2+20xy+y^2=zz.....from here interpretation would be very difficult without assuming anything extra..but since we know it has unique soln..let assume x not eq to 0..then taking 100 common >100(x^2+y)+20xy=zz....interpretin again..if y=o then either wy get xxx0 or yy=zz both not possible because first part containing hundred rulez everything but second parts drives towards contradictionTo avoid those cases just take y<>", "subanswer": {"text": "zero thus eliminating case leadingtowards possibilityof getting same digitnumberon rhs other sidehence proved:)", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "That solves everythin completely !!!
