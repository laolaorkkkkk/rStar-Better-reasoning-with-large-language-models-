Because it said so explicitly! :)", "3": "Each set consists of One Blue Tie plus its Red Counterpart ie $40 + ($40*1.5). This translates into 40+60= $100 for every pair of ties sold to him. Remember profit=selling price - cost price convention. Here the selling price is one way of earning money, hence the addition here. And remember the question specified all ties of both colors went unsold meaning full absorption of the production cost. Hence no need to worry about any profit margins etc. just pure absorption costing. That means everything John earned went towards his overall spending on acquiring those goods. It doesn\u2019t mean anything else except what we just discussed. Moving along\u2026..", "4": "Given one set consisted of $100, then 10 such sets therefore amount to 10*$100=$1000 worth of red ties. Note that when doing math in situations like this, you can often shortcut things by thinking of the big picture first and getting your bearings right before you plow ahead with micro calculations. For instance if each item costs $100 dollars and I want ten of them that means 10*$100=$1000 or in other words you can just rearrange the numbers around according to what you know multiplication is associative and commutative. But be careful cause some of these problems may play tricks on you through the use of wording and you do not want to fall for their traps. More on this later! ;) Meanwhile speaking of which, Our next task requires us determine the grand total of how much cash John shelled out for procuring both types of ties. We simply do that by adding up the two amounts derived above; the \u2018blue\u2019 and the \u2018red\u2019 ones calculated respectively as $200 and $1000. Their sum results in $200+$1000= $1200.
