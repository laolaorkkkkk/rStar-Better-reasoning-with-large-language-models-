Since Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts at $16.50 per pair, she spent 3 * $16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. For pants it was 3 * $22.50 = $67.50 And finally for shoes it was 3 * $42 = $126.", "2": "To get the overall amount Mischa spends add up these amounts so $49.50 + $67.50 + $126= $243 . Hence ,Mischa Spends$243onalltheclothingitems", "3": "So then our solution would look like this : $$ \\text{Total Cost} = (\\#_{Shorts}\\times\\text{Cost}_{Shorts}) +(\\#_{\\text{Pants}}\\times\\text{Cost}_{\\text{Pants}})+(\\#_{\\text{Shoes}}\\times\\text{Cost}_{\\text{Shoes}}) $$ $$ \\text{Total Cost} =(3\\times \\$16.50)+(3\\times \\$22.50)+(3\\times \\$42)=\\$$49.50+\\$67.50+\\$126=\\$243.$$", "4": "So he must have spent $\\boxed{\\$243}$", "5": "Answer is:\\$\\boxed{{243}}$.", "6": "Thus we can see him having Spent altogether or Total$=243$."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
