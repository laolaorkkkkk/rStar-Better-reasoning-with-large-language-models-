This means if we let G denote for what time Gerald could once run it before he changed his diet then $G+2=38$, since lee who was running at $G$ plus two seconds equals thirty eight minutes or simply rewritten as $G=38\u22122$. Solving this equation simplifies into $G = 36.$ Hence Gerald use to take thirty six minutes on average over four hundred meters .Then new times came along ,and Gerald decided improve himself so much such things like eating right etc... His performance increased overall! And guess what ? It got him down all the way to taking only $\\boxed{32}$minutes averaging off across those grand prix circuit.. That amounts to improvement increase rate equivalent to $((36\u201332)/36)*100\\%=11.\\overline{1}\\% $. Yes !

Here, you correctly identified that letting `G` represent the time Gerald took initially (before changing his diet), leads us to the equation `G + 2 = 38`. By solving for `G`, one gets `G = 36`. Thus, Gerald used to take 36 minutes to finish the race on average. With his improved diet, his time decreased to 32 minutes because the problem states that his speed improved by 10%, implying that he took 90% of the original time (`0.9*36 = 32.4`), which rounds up to 32 minutes.
