How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?", "ost_step": {"1": "First we need to figure out what Vincent would pay if he bought all his flowers as individual ones without any package discount. Since each flower costs him either $\\frac{2.5}{3}$ dollars per flower when you buy them in groups of three or $\\frac{1}{2}$ dollar per flower when you buy them individually , so let's calculate both prices first before deciding on one. We see then than Vincent could spend $ \\frac{18\\cdot 2.5}{3} = 15$ dollars if he buys everything in triples packs or $18/2=9$ dollars if every single bunch was purchased separately . This means that choosing triple pack option saves him $15\u22129=6$. Alternatively it also equals just simply calculating savings trough cheaper way \\[ \\frac {18\\cdot(2/3-1/2)}{1/2} =6\\]of doing it. Answer is therefore 6 dollars.", "2": "Let\u2019s consider another approach solving this task using algebra rather than arithmetic only. It is important to realize here that regardless of the type of bunch (triple or double) that Vincent decides to buy, the total amount of money he spends is going to be divided by the number of flowers (18), hence their unit cost must be compared directly to reach a decision. Given that the cost of buying bunches of three is $2.5$, while those of two only cost $1$, clearly buying flowers individually ($1/2$) is not the best choice. However, to confirm this mathematically we can set up shop and check whether the unit price ($2.5/3$) of buying flowers in bundles of three is less or greater than the unit price of buying flowers in pairs ($1/2$). And indeed \\[\\frac{2.5}{3}> \\frac{1}{2}\\]This implies that purchasing flowers in pair is the better bet saving\\[(\\frac{2.5}{3}-\\frac{1}{2})\\cdot 18=(15-9)/2^1=3.\\]dollars against the triple purchase option., where / denotes division symbol.
