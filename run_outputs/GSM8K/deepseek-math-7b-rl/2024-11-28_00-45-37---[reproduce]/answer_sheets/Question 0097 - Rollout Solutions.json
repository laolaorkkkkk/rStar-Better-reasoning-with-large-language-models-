This means the amount of raw tomatoes fed into the sauce making machine equals twice the amount of sauce produced.

But you cannot really cut up a fraction of a can, thus we must assume I made an error somewhere! A quick check back through my work shows me indeed that i erred on the second to last line; since each can only holds three whole tomatoes, rather than the x variable representing the whole amount of liquid in a can, it actually stands for three tomatoes worth of liquid.... As such our revised equation is:(numbercans*liquidpercan)=(totalounces)/(one can's worth of liquid)*(# of whole tomatoes per can)--> (", "2": "Number of cans*3 tomatoes/can=(Total Ounces)/(0.5*Original Can Size):#c*3=(32 oz.)/(0.5(16 oz.)):c*3=4:c=4/3=. An impossibility!!. On reexamination of the problem it becomes clear that Freda was using whole canned tomatoes as opposed to pure juice; therefore although each can does lose half its volume, the whole number of tomatoes remains intact during cooking process. Our new equation needs to reflect that quality:Number of entire Tomatoes Used=(Total Sauce Produced)/(Whole number of tomatoes remaining after processing per can) --> #TT=(32 oz)/(1/2(16 oz.))--> TT=((32)(16))/16=>32; but we also know the number of these units is going to be 3 times the number of actual cans used: #3C=32-> C=32/3=#C~. That doesn't make any sense either! It seems logical enough that Freda used at least three whole cans of tomatoes to achieve thirty two ounces of product BUT it appears that by failing to account for the conservation of mass in this problem (the fact that matter", "3": "isn't created nor destroyed in the cooking process), I got off track; fortunately the math failure forced me to question the validity of my first assumption leading ultimately to the resolution of the paradox! Freda started with 32 ounces of finished product and because the can size was 16 ounces (and therefore contained three tomatoes worth of liquid content) one might assume that exactly eight cans went into the making of the sauce.....Yet upon revisiting the problem, it became apparent that while the end product was 32 ounces, the starting material most definitely could not have been eight whole cans of tomatoes since each can loses \u00bd its volume when cooked!!! For example, if you started with eight cans of tomatoes, each containing 16 ounces of liquid, you'd wind up with 8(16*.5)=64 ounces of product -- double the 32 ounces called for in the recipe!. This discrepancy implies that the original number of cans assumed (eight) is too high; thankfully the aforementioned error checking process will automatically lead us to the correct number.

Unfortunately this still doesn't align with our expectations; IF Freda used just under two cans of tomatoes the result wouldn't come close to 32 ounces of sauce. By now the math aspect of the problem has hopefully been discarded in favor of a visual representation of the situation; we know Freda started with a specific number of cans, got rid of half their volume through cooking and ended up with 32 ounces. From this information we can deduce that each can must have originally been 16*2= 32 ounces big-- clearly impossible given that no can is that large! Instead we must accept that our faulty logic compelled us to set up an unsolvable equation. Remember the conversation we had earlier about needing to preserve matter in a chemical reaction?

Let c equal the number of cans used; therefore our equation becomes:.5xc=32 oz., or multiplying both sides times two yields:xc=64oz.. We want know what this quantity represents as far as whole fresh tomatoes go--each container holds three tomatoes so all we need to do it place our result above over three: #of cans * value per can =(total weight /value)/three tomatoes/can=(64oz)/(3)=~21.33... But you cannot really cut up a fraction of a can, thus we must assume I made an error somewhere! A quick check back through my work shows me indeed that i erred on the second to last line; since each can only holds three whole tomatoes, rather than the x variable representing the whole amount of liquid in a can, it actually stands for three tomatoes worth of liquid.... As such our revised equation is:(numbercans*liquidpercan)=(totalounces)/(one can's worth of liquid)*(# of whole tomatoes per can)--> (", "2": "Solving using similar methodology to previous problem (but remembering the above caveat), we get::c*(3oz.)=32oz --> c=32/3oz.= ~10.66..., BUT again we cannot have a portion of a canso clearly another mistake was made! Alrighty then, time to take a deep breath and reevaluate the problem at hand. Knowing that freda's batches always yield half the original volume of the starting material, these 32 oz must represent half the original volume of the entire batch(in other words, if the original volume before cooking was y, then .5y=32). From here, solving for y is simply a matter of multiplication: .5y=32 ---> y=32/.5 =64 oz.! Whoopee! Now knowing that Freda started with 64 oz of tomatoes, and further knowing that those 64 oz contained a certain number of cans, each holding 3oz worththree tomatoes, we can divide the total ounces by the ounces per can to find the number of cans: 64oz./3oz.

Problem Revisited To begin, consider that Freda's sauce only contains half the original volume of the tomatoes used. Thus we know that the 32 oz of sauce represents exactly that - half the original volume. Clearest way to solve this problem then is to backsolve! Starting with our initial option of 10.6 containers of 16 oz each (16*10.6=169.6 oz) Clearly we can tell that this is too high since it'd mean Freda started with 339.2 oz of product - double that of what she ended up"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First multiply the numbers of cans by the volume of fluid in each one: \\[ \\", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume.

When making soup from canned tomatoes, the liquid used in the cooking shrinks the volume of the tomatoes down to exactly half their original weight. Since each 16oz can started with three tomatoes inside them the total weight of those tomatoes at the beginning was 16oz \u00d73 /one can = 48 oz for all the cans combined. It should be obvious that if those 48 oz worth of tomatoes ended up as 32 oz of sauce then something got thrown away in the cooking process and that something is exactly the other half of the original 48 oz - the 32 oz that remained in the sauce. And indeed :48 oz -- 32 oz = 16 oz just like the 16 oz of cans themselves!.So whether you calculate it right or wrong, either way works because you get the same result!!"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, and there are four cans of tomatoes (as calculated above), so the total number of tomatoes is 3 * 4 = 12 tomatoes", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
