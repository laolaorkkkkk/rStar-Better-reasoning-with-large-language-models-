An increase of 150% means adding 150% of the initial cost to the initial cost. Therefore, if we denote X as the change in the value due to the improvements, we get the equation: $$X = 150\\% \\times \\$130,\\!000.$$ Converting percentages into decimals allows us to simplify the calculation: $$X = 1.5 \\times \\$130,\\!000 = \\$\\boxed{195},\\!000.$$ Adding this figure to the initial cost tells us the new total value of the house: $$\\text{New Value} = \\$\\boxed{130},\\!000 + \\$\\boxed{195},\\!000 = \\$\\boxed{325},\\!000.$$ Finally, calculating the profit involves subtracting the initial investment from the current value of the house: $$\\text{Profit} = \\$\\boxed{325},\\!000 - \\$\\boxed{130},\\!000 = \\$\\boxed{195},\\!000.$$Thus, Joshua made $\\$\\boxed{195},000 in profit.$", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 4}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.
