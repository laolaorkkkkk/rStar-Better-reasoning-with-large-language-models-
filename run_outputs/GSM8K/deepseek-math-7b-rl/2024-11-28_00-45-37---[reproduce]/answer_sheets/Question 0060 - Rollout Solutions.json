Answer confirmation : By adding up both fractions of the population(bad/unripe/sour), it totals at least fifteen individuals accounted for($1+5+2$). Taking twenty five total apples minus thirteen non-good ones leaves seventeen accounting for what could only be described as wholesome fruit .As such makes$\\boxed {17}$.", "5": "In conclusion therefore; There exists clearly Seventeen Good Oranges existing happily inside our imaginarybasketof fictionalfruits"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "This problem involves understanding percentages and basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Let's break down the information given: Total number of oranges: 25 Number of bad oranges: 1 Number of unripe oranges (20% of the total): 0.2 * 25 = 5 Number of sour oranges: 2 We want to find out the number of good oranges. First, let's add up the numbers of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 These eight oranges are not good.
