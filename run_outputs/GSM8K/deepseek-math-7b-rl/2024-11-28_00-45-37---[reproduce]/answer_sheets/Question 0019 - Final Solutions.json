We know that she walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. Her overall goal is to walk a total of 12 miles in some number T of hours where T = 2 + (remaining distance)/x. Because we want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we can write: 12/T = 4. Solving this equation, we get: 12/(2 + (remaining distance)/x) = 4. Multiplying both sides by (2 + (remaining distance)/x), we get: 12 = 4(2 + (remaining distance)/x). Expanding the right side, we get: 12 = 8 + 4(remaining distance)/x. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 4 = 4(remaining distance)/x. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 1 = (remaining distance)/x. Finally, substituting the fact that the remaining distance is 6 miles, we get: 1 = 6/x. Cross multiplying, we get: x = 6. So Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. From our calculation, knowing that r=6mph satisfies the requirement of having an average speed of 4 mph makes sense because if u look at whole trip 12mi in 3hrs avg speed is 4mph", "value": 0.5}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To figure out the speed she needs to maintain to have an average speed of 4 mph throughout the entire journey, let's break down the information known so far into mathematical expressions: Total Distance = 12 miles Time taken for initial part of journey (first 6 miles) = 1+1 = 2 hours Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Initial Part of Journey = 12 - 6 = 6 miles Required time taken to complete the remaining distance such that the overall average speed is 4 mph = Total Time Taken - Time taken for initial part of journey = (12 / 4 ) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 hour Therefore, Speed needed to accomplish the remaining distance in 1 hour = Remaining Distance / Required Time = 6 / 1 = 6 mph", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 12}]
