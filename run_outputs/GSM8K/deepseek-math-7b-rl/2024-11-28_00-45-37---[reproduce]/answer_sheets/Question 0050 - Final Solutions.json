Divide the total number of eggs (252) by the number of eggs in a dozen (12). This will give you `252/12=21` dozens of eggs per day.\nStep 2: Determine how much profit Lloyd makes from selling these eggs each day. Multiply the number of dozens sold (`21`) by the cost per dozen ($2), which results in `$2*21=$42`. Therefore, Lloyd brings home $42 per day from selling his eggs.\nStep 3: Find out how much revenue Lloyd generates over the course of a week. As there are 7 days in a week, multiply the dollar value generated each day ($42) by the number of days in a week (7). Calculation shows \"$42*7=$294\".
