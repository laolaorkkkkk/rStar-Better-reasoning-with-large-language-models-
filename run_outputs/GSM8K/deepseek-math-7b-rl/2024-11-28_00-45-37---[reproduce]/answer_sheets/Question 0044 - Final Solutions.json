Since he can make 10 candles per pound, he used 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10. Next, we calculate the income from selling the candles. Each candle is sold for $2, so the total income is 20*$2 = $40. To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the income: $40 - $10 = $30. Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $30.
