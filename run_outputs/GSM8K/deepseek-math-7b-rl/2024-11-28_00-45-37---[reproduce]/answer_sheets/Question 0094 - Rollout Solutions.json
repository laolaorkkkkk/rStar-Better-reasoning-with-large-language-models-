That means if we add the number of dogs and cats together, and then subtract 12, we will get the number of rabbits. Dogs plus Cats equals 60 + 120 = 180. And when we take off 12 from that result, we end up with Rabbits equal to 180 - 12 = 168. Finally, putting all these figures together, adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits give us our total number of pets ---> Pets = Dogs + Cats + Rabbits ----> Pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348", "value": 0.7}, "ost_step": {"1": "We know that if the number of dogs is $D$, then the number of cats would be twice as much because it says there are two cats for every dog i.e., Number of Cats $(C)$= 2 * D or C = 2*60 since we said earlier that D equals sixty; hence giving us Cat(C)=120 . Combining this result withequation one above, namely Rabbits$(R)$,we get : R=(Dog+Cat)-12 ,which simplifies over substitution into our equation like so: R =(60+120 )\u221212 ; thus finding firstly Total Pets T:= Dog + Cat +Rabbit OR simply looking at what value does equate To R making use ofthe previously found values inserted into itsequation e.g.: ((60+120 )\u221212), finally simplifying yields your solution.", "2": "Doing these steps shows you quickly reach something called 'your target equation'.
