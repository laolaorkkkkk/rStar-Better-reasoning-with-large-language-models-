Since the dragon's flames reach out to 1000 feet, Polly standing 1200 feet away from the dragon would be outside its reach if she holds the gemstone. However, since we're talking about being able to hit the dragon and not considering how close it is, Polly cannot actually be that far away unless the dragon was far enough away initially.

This makes sense because we want to know how far out of range the dragon gets, so it would make most sense to use the maximum distance Polly could throw versus the maximum distance that dragons can be harmed. So we have 1200-1000=200. To find the amount the dragon is too near to for Polly to hit it, subtract the total damage limit from the maximum throwing distance: TotalDamage - DamageLimit = DistanceFromDragon.
