        " (there was no one else who made the same prediction), I won something from my own side. The possible outcomes of my betting were either a draw or home win, but since neither player made the correct prediction, it means it's a draw. Since each bet costs \u00a31 and you've bet two times at home, I'm sure you paid \u00a32 (as your only earning was on home bets). I also think the second home betting should earn \u00a35 instead of \u00a310 due to the conditions mentioned earlier ($5+\u00a310=\u00a315$. So, your total earnings are the sum of earnings from all bets:$2-\\{\u00a32-\u00a32\\}=\u00a32$",
