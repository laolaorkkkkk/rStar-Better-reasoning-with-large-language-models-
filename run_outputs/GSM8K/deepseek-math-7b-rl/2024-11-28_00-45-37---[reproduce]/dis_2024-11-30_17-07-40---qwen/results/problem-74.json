Rounding down to the closest whole dollar means that anything under $3 rounds down to the next lower whole dollar. Since 2.74 and 2.12 both round down to 2, their product with any quantity will round down to exactly that quantity as well. Therefore this term doesn't impact our solution at all... Let's move on to the next option. 1.87 dollars actually falls between two whole dollars. As it increases just past 1 whole dollar, but falls short until just before reaching another whole dollar, the decision as to whether it rounds up or down rests solely on its proximity to its two neighboring points. In other words, since 1.87 is very close to 2, rounding it to the nearest whole dollar would result in the price increasing to a value equal to or greater than 2. However, it will not increase further because it is closer to 1 than it is to 2, so our answer here is 2 dollars. Now let's deal with the final option. We know 2.12 dollars also rounds down to 2 because it's right near the halfway point, just less than half way between 2 and 3. Thus when multiplied together it still rounds down to equal 2 as above. Our cost per pot was therefore determined to be \\$2.00. This can be used to determine our total revenue easily.
