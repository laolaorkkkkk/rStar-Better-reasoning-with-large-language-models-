Therefore, we calculate this amount and multiply it by six since there are six remaining months in the year. Finally, add this amount to the initial amount she paid to get a total amount for the whole year. Let's break down the calculation in steps and write the Python code for accuracy:",
        " the right and divide by 2 ($14 = 14/2 or $14= $70*.5) We're going to use the value of $70 as the reduced annual price (as $70*1.1 = $77 not exactly 10%). As you can see this is actually a geometric sequence with r=0.5 since all subsequent monthly prices are being halved from previous months price, allowing you to use the summation formula as follows: S_n=a_1((1-r^n)/ (1-r)) Where S_n represents our sum, a_1 is equal to the first term which was calculated above ($70), r is equal to 0.5 (the common ratio) and n represents our desired number of terms which is 6 (since we are taking into consideration only the period of the second half). Hence: S_n=$70(1-.5^6) / (.5) = $395. This calculation will result in us purchasing an extra six months\u2019 worth of payments rather than the entire twelve months\u2019 payment hence the answer is equal to$140+$395 =$535.",
        " $.86*12= $10.32. Then multiply $10.32 times a full 6-month period (6) because half of a year equals 6 months. This results in a subtotal total of $61.92 to add onto the first-half payment total giving us $201.92 overall total for the full year of monthly subscriptions combined.",
        " yielding up to a grand total of $1,596 paid over the course of the entire year.",
        " well. Calculate how much she was charged in the second half of the year. It's a little trickier this time! First you need to understand what '10% less' means. This means that the second half would cost you 10% less than you paid during the first half. To work out a percentage of something, you divide it into 100 equal parts. Therefore 10% out of 140 would equate to $14 because 140 divided by 10 is 14, which represents ten percent of one hundred dollars. We've said already that in the second half she pays 10% less than we did in the first half which can all put together show us this equation ($140-($14))x6 = total price for half year. We use parentheses here because it says to perform this part of the equation first before any else. So we subtracted the $14 from the $140 to get $126, multiplied that by the two and got our answer of $252. All things considered we know from above that the first half of the year was $840. And now we add these together to get the total price over the course of the year, $1092.",
        " this half. As such for month seven Aleena pays $140-($140*.10)=$126. By the time month thirteen concludes Aleena has paid ($840)+[($126)*12]=$1,512 as the complete total for the entire year.",
        " value ($140), by .10 (the decimal representation of 10%) which produces a difference value of $14; subtracting this amount from 100%, or $140-14=126 allows you to determine the discounted fee for each individual invoice issued during this time period in excess of just the first payment made. Therefore, $126 applies to all invoices produced during this stage of the transaction process after it has passed through the first bill. Because this calculation is repeated every month during this period frame, we will need to apply the percentage based pricing rule to the current value. Since we already have calculated how much has been previously paid during the first half of the calendar year, we will need only add our newly calculated discounted prices associated with the 6 remaining payments accrued during the second half of this calendar year (i.e., June to December): ($126+$126) = $252. The sum of the entire yearly charge is simply the addition of the original amount paid during the first six months plus twice the current dollar price charged for subsequent monthly payments: $840+($252+$252) =$1,344, meaning Aleena paid a total of $1,344 dollars upon completion of the aforementioned streaming subscription deal.",
