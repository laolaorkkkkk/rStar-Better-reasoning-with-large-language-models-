A percent increase or decrease of 1% will always mean you multiply by .01 or divide by 100. This same logic follows for any percentages. To add two fifths it would be like adding 2/5 + 1/5 which would get us 3/5. Therefore, it becomes evident that 25% is equal to .25. Multiply .25 times gunther's original guess which is 80. .25(80) is equivalent to .01(80)x5=2(80)=160. Since the equation equals 160 and it says 'more' instead of 'add', we subtract 80. 160-80=80. Finally, to answer this question correctly, all that remains is simply finding the average of these three numbers by adding them together then dividing. 80+60+80/3=220/3=73 1/3.

        " friends\u2019 guesses about the number of jelly beans in the jar. The average can only be calculated once the value is known. Therefore let us just find what those different values are. The friend who said 80 would get 80 jelly beans in the jar. The second friend said 20 more than half the value given previously so we have (80/2) + 20 which simplifies into 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. Lastly, the third person said 25% more than the original amount therefore our new equation becomes (1/25)(80). This converts into 32 because that is 0.04x80 or .04(80) which gives 3.2. Adding these three values together gives 172. Now we simply divide this number by the amount of guesses which is three so we get 57.333.. If we round up we would get a final number of 57.",

To calculate the average of any set of numbers, simply add them together and divide by the amount of items in the set. This leaves us with an average guess of (100+100+100)/3 or [3(100)]/3=100. The Average of the guesses is 100, which is our final answer. The average guess was exactly equal to the other guesses because each of the guesses matched up perfectly.",
