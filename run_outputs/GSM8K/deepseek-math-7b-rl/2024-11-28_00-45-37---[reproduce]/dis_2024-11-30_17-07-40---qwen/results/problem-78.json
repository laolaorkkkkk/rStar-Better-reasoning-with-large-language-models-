The correct savings calculation should align with the direct comparison method shown above, showing he only uses the cheap pricing option and thus saves $0 initially. But let's confirm it again with code.",
        " means one buys nine 2 packs @ \\$1 which also equals \\$9 . The lesser cost option here means getting the first deal. Therefore for all nine packs at once he pays less because it takes away money from those already paid during his shopping trip .",
        " subtract these extra flowers from the cost! Three-pack minus twice-packs = $15-$7-2 =$6 Worth of flowers saved by doing what would most likely be a much faster and cheaper way.",
        " units being cancelled to solve word based questions! Example 1. How much time passes while driving at a speed of 60mph from New York City to Washington D.C. which is 210 miles away? ",
        " 15$ or $ \\frac{18 \\cdot 1}{2} = 9$, so thus Vincent would spend less money if he buys flowers in the larger quantity. Thus we deduce that Vincent saves $15 - 9 = 6$ dollars.",
        " subtracting actual price of bigger group from smaller one: $2.5\u00b76 \u22121\u00b79 = 6$. Which makes sense because he spent less time (at least I guess) if he only needs to pick up 18 flowers instead of grouping them into smaller amounts of 3 or 2 (which will make more trips).",
        " purchase, the cost will always be proportional to the amount of flowers that you want to buy. Therefore, the ratio of cost (C) against the number of flowers (F) is always constant within all the different ways of purchasing.",
        " When Vincent chooses to buy flowers as triple packages, he gets a cost per flower of \\(\\frac {2.5}3\\). And if he chooses the other option, which is to buy them as pairs, he'll pay \\(\\frac {1}{2}\\) for a single flower. So Vincent saves money by choosing the second option because of its lesser unit cost \\(\\frac {1}{2} \\leq \\frac{2.5}{3}\\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{18 \\times (2.5/3 - 1/2)}{1/2} = \\boxed{6}\\) of saving."
