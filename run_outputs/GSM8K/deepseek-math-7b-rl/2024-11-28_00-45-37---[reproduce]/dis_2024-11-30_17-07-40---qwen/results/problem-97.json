Correcting our approach, since one can produces 16 ounces of sauce (because 32 ounces is what she ends up with after losing half), and we know each can originally contained 16 ounces of tomatoes (since one can equals one dozen tomatoes and 3 tomatoes make one can), then Freda used exactly one can of tomatoes, which means she used 3 tomatoes from that can.",

As said earlier a full can yields one cup (from our discussion above), one-half of a cup is half a can which only yields half a cup so let's take care of the other half cups separately. We find that one and a half cups are in the original amount (we divide three tomatoes in one cup into halves to find out how many half-cups the first full can yields which is six in total). And one and a half cups are in two cans as well (which makes sense because we know there are six half-cups so adding one full cup makes eleven half-cups which gives us seven half-cups in two cans since a total of thirteen half-cups are present in four cans.)

        " you're dealing with tomato sauce etc. 64/16 equals 4 which makes sense since a quart is four pints. However, for every quart in the beginning we're told you have 3 (or a number, depending on your recipe), so instead of having 64 parts of juice, we actually start with 4 quarts of juice and we also know that we have 3 tomatoes per quart. Thus, the 64 we came up with earlier is wrong. Instead of using the word \"quart,\" it should probably be \"pound\" as we're all working with ounces here, since an hour only consists of one part. Using this analogy, we still understand the problem correctly. We simply need to find out how many pounds of sauce we started off with. If we have 32 ounces left over at the end and the sauce volume is reduced by half, then the starting amount would be twice that amount. Therefore, we would start off with 32*2 = 64 ounces of soup. Knowing this information, how many pounds of tomatoes did we need? Well, the question states that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes gives us three tomatoes. 16*3 = 48, meaning 16 ounce cans of tomatoes contain 48 ounces of tomatoes. Dividing our known amount of soup we started with (in ounces) by the amount of soup per can of tomatoes we're required to work out the amount of people used: 64/48 equals approximately 1.33 cans of tomatoes. However, because we can't even cut a tomato in half, this leaves us with one person who received just three tomatoes, while another received just eight tomatoes, but both still have enough. To fully solve this mathematically without cutting tomatoes in half, we could use the following reasoning: since we have six full cans of tomato soup leftover (because we have double the amount we started with), and we use them all up along with the remaining three leftover tomatoes, we can assume we make three batches of tomato soup (one batch of seven tomatoes each). This means Freda has used a total of three batches of tomato soup worth three tomatoes per batch, totaling 9 tomatoes!",

If one can holds 16 oz of tomatoes and contains three tomatoes per can, then 32 oz of all that is 2 cans full (because every 16 oz cup is half of that amount; so double to make it go back to a normal measuring system). And since there are 3 tomatoes per can, then that means 6 tomatoes were used for the entire batch of tomato sauce. The answer is: 6",

        " even if it doesn\u2019t make sense yet (not that I\u2019m saying there actually is...)...now onto counting...there are three tomatoes in every can so just multiply the 3 by however many cans you used up which is determined by the amount of tomatoes you started with since you know that each one makes the base recipe of your sauce while cooking. If we start with 64 oz of sauce why not break the amount down into cups? Well that\u2019s going to take us to another unit though which is half cup since that\u2019s a good size we could get right away so let\u2019s see...well now imagine you have 64 oz of sauce! We want all our units together so how about converting all the units to cups for easier calculation since these numbers don\u2019t mix well in different units\u2026we go down to whole numbers of cups which gives us 8, but wait remember this was going back to making a base recipe of the tomato sauce which also requires 48 cups instead of 3 (since you double it). So how does the sauce relate to our tomato count?!? 8 cups / 48 cups = .16666 so if we have that many tomato batches that would mean we\u2019re getting 8(.16) which equals 1.25 tomatoes which is impossible therefore we are missing a factor of 2 on both the numerator and denominator. This means if you double everything we\u2019ll get exactly 2 full batches so that we get our 64 oz which is necessary to cook down to 32 ounces or two batches of tomato sauce!!

So even though you have a maximum capacity of 3 tomatoes per can based on its contents in the can, some fraction of said fractions of tomatoes will spill over and turn into sauce. Since the exact weight of each tomato is unknown, you can only assume that the weight lost will be a certain percentage which, in practice, may vary widely from can to can.

However, since you cannot have fractions of a tomato, we round this down to 42. So, 42 tomatoes would yield approximately 21 ounces of sauce (since 42 divided by 3 is 14), which is half of the 32 ounces of sauce produced, making sense to us because they all lose half their volume when boiled away by the heat. So, in reality, you'd need 84 tomatoes (not 42) to produce 32 ounces of sauce through boiling without any loss of flavor!",

Furthermore, knowing how many individual ingredients contributed to any given serving demonstrates that each of them individually amounts to sixteenth of what she consumed earlier - namely, four distinct tomato elements from separate containers, per serving! Consequently, given her intake size (i.e., 32 oz) of her delicious tomato concoction during this very precise cooking endeavor, together with the established knowledge regarding the composition (eighteen components contribute towards every single bite!) within a regular can (which included twenty-four ingredients), coupled together via simple multiplication yields the ultimate conclusion that there were approximately sixty-six whole apples scattered about in said container \u2013 all but the ones used to manufacture that delightful treat.",

Thus, the total volume of original ingredients (cans) is twice the volume used in the sauce production, leading us to conclude that Freda used as many original cans to make the 32 ounces of sauce as she used for the 3 cans that resulted in double their initial volumes.
