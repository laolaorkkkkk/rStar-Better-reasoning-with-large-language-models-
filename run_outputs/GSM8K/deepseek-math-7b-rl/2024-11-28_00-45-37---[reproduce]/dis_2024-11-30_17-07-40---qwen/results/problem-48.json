That means that Tracy has 4 feet or 48 inches. Multiply that by .0254 to get 1.2192m of wire. If this is confusing don\u2019t worry; I may add more explanation later. Each piece of wire you make out of this length will be 6\u201d long, or .1524 m, so you\u2019ll take your length and multiply it by the amount of pieces you want to make. If you want to find the amount of pieces you\u2019ve made take your length and divide it by .1524. This will give you 8.01 pieces if you\u2019re dealing with whole numbers you probably should round up as we\u2019re talking about pieces of string not fractions. And this might seem really obvious but once students start dividing larger numbers this starts to be important.

Our first step is going to be converting everything into inches because our lengths will be easy to compare. 4 feet = 48 inches (as a foot is equal to twelve inches). We also know that a length of six inches is going to give us a whole piece of string. So this means that every single six inch unit here represents one individual piece of string.

Now if we use this information we can find out how many such pieces Tracy cut off.. As she cut off the entire length of 101.6 cm i.e whole length so as to get pieces of only 15.24 cm .. so she can cut only 101.6/0.6 = 16.93 pieces but she can only cut 16 full pieces because even half a pieces would have required her to go for another piece and thus we round down 16.93 to 16 as no fractional piece can exist.. hence, Tracy got 16 full pieces of wire.",
