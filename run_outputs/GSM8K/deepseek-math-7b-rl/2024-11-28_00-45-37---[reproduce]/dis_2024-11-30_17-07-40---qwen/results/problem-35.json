In our problem, however, we don't know what percentage of his time he actually played so we just leave this term as $P$, which represents any percent of time $P= \\frac{total\\:time\\:played}{total\\_game\\_time}$. Thus, the equation becomes $f(P) = P \\cdot (4 + (4P / 100)) = P^2/25 + 4P/25$. But notice that when $P$ changes, both terms change proportionally such that their ratio remains constant. We can set up a proportional equation as follows: $$\\frac{\\Delta(f(P))/P}{\\Delta(P)/P}=\\text{constant}\\implies \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta P}=\\text{const.},\\;\\text{which is clearly a linear relationship between $f(P)$ and $P$}.$$ Thus we find ourselves dealing with a very nice function. Since we have figured out that the relation between points and total game time is basically a linear function whose slope depends solely on the size of the percentage we choose, I decided to find the maximum value of this linear function; that is, the value of $f(P)$ for $\\frac{\\text{total game}}{\\text{percentage of game}}= \\max$. If we divide the total game into whatever percentage we want (assuming that no other factors come into play like running out of supplies), the best way to maximize the amount of points achieved is obviously to choose $100\\%$ because this is always a fixed ratio and the more points he does achieve, the higher the maximum potential total of points to be obtained.
