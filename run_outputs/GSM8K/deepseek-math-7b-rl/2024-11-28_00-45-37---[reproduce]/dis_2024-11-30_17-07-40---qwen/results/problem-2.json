It's simply 100% increased. Since no value or percentage point exists below 100%, multiply our initial base value of $80,000 and add 150% ($80,000*2.5=200,000).

Therefore we need to multiple the base value by 3 to find the final value, $240,000. And finally, subtracting our total investment in the project, $130,000, from its final value, $240,000, gets us our profit of $240,000 - $130,000 = $110,000. But wait - remember! Profit is gained as a result of investing; if Josh had lost any money due to losses or unexpected expenses during the process (which aren't mentioned here), his actual profits would differ from the simple dollar difference shown here. In our calculations so far, no such losses or expenses have been accounted for. To account for potential income from additional sources like rental income for the house \u2013 which may have occurred over its useful life if sold before reaching market equilibrium \u2013 it\u2019s essential to consider these factors and incorporate them logically when arriving at a true outcome accurately. Let us assume that no specific data on ongoing income or external factors affecting the house value over its duration is provided directly nor derived computationally, keeping focus solely on calculated changes under standardized transactional contexts.

But, of course, since it only took him $80,000 to buy the whole thing from the ground up...his profit is just the difference between selling the house for $195,000 AND spending $80,000 to get it back to where it truly belongs to him!

Solving, we get $x = $2,400,000 meaning the house was $2.4 million when he bought it.

Therefore let us assume we're dealing with scenario where house value increases (the exact amount by which it changes relative to previous value isn't provided either\u2014this portion of the problem I suppose requires educated assumptions based off of context in order to proceed without specifying any unknowns), which leaves us with simply asking what profit (gross return minus expenditures) could be expected thus leaving us wanting only dollar amounts under budgeted expense vs dollar expenditure resulting profit being calculated as gross return (after spending on house expenses previously already deducted for sake of simplicity & clarity here) less sum spent (spent initially to buy house & additional repair costs including whatever associated costs related to improved state of mind about living) hence gross return minus total expenditures resulting in positive balance indicating what net gains (as net return less expenditures) are achieved from investing money into real estate project rather than keeping it under your mattress where time, interest rate & rates associated with savings account exceed potential future income generating opportunities in the market currently available compared against alternative housing investments & their associated costs as well as ongoing maintenance fees related to houses under construction / maintained while waiting until fully built / functioning thereby saving money toward eventual purchase prices versus lower future rental market prices (debtors' payments not counted here for lack thereof although certainly valuable factor to include also).",
        " value of the house was. The problem says the repairs caused the house to increase in value by 150%, which means it went up 150/100 times its original price, or 1.5 times its original price. The original price was $80,000 (the purchase price of the house). So, when you take this original price and multiply it by 150% (which equals 1.5), you get $120,000 for the repairs. Therefore, the final value of the house after repair is the sum of the repairs' contribution to the house's price and the original purchase price of the house. Adding these values together, the final price comes out to $120,000 + $80,000 = $200,000. Now all we have to do is subtract our initial investment ($130,000) from our final value of the house ($200,000) to find out how much profit we made. That gives us $200,000 -$130,000 = $70,000.

So, next, we use the information about the increase in value. When Josh brought home the house that was worth $X, he paid all the money back down. But that means he made a 150% return on the original investment ($80,000). 80,000 multiplied by 1.5 = 120,000. (150% return means that he doubled his original investment and then added an extra 50% more.). Because Josh spent $50,000 trying to sell the house, he needs to get $170,000 for the house to make a 150% return on his investment. However this doesn't make sense because we know that only 30,000 more dollars were added and not 170,000. This part of the problem is poorly worded. I believe it actually meant that $50,000 worth of damage was repaired to the house which resulted in a $120,000 gain. It would read: Now using this information, let us see what Josh sold the house for! Josh paid $130,000 for the house, which includes its value before the repairs as well as the amount of work he needed to pay off himself.

Now, we can use this number (87.5% or 0.875) to calculate the increase in value based upon the percentage increase in the price of the home.

Dividing both sides by 5 yields: 15/10 = 1.5. Therefore, any multiplier of 150% is equivalent to the decimal point of 1.5 multiplied by 200/100, which simplifies to 2. Since the multiplier of 2 can also be represented as a multiplier of 1 + 1, we know that it increases the price by exactly double itself. Once we know the first two steps, we already have everything needed for finding the new price of the house.

Therefore, Josh's profit is,$195{,}000$, or $\\boxed{195{,}000}$. In another example, suppose Joe's rent payment for a month is 30% larger than his income. If he takes home \u00a3680 a month, what was his rent? Let's represent his monthly income first: $I =$ Joe's monthly income and $R =$ Rent per month So we know that $I =$ Joe's monthly income $I =$ $680$, Also we know that Joe's rent is 30% higher than his income. That means Rent = Income + (30% of Income) We can convert that into an equation using algebra:$R = I+ .30(I) $Substituting$ 680 $into our formula, we'll get$R = 680+.30(680)\\$",
