Since we found the number of silver coins, now we have to multiply $$30$$ by $$3$$ to find out how much we're really counting. So we know that $$x\\times 3$$ represents the amount of gold coins Gretchen has... plug this into the equation! Since it says $$\\boxed{3x=100}$$, we can substitute the equation we just created in place of the \"$$\\mathbf{x}$$\" part of the \"$$\\mathbf{3x}$$\" equation. So instead of writing \"$$\\boxed{3x=100}$$\", write\\[\\boxed{\\color{red}{3\\times 40}=100}\\]. This means Gretchen has $\\boxed{30}$ gold coins!",
