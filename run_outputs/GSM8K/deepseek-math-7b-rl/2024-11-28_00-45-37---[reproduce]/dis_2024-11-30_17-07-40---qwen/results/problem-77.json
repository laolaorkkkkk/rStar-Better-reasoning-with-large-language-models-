        " would only be a quarter of what Sarah completes given that he completed less than sarah as mentioned earlier. Therefore he completed 100 pounds of chores. According to the hints it is also stated that Raymonds equivalent load completion rate equals half the load that Sarah completes which means Raymmond was responsible for fifty pounds of laundry completing exactly half of Sarahs completion . By determining these amounts clearly shown earlier therefore , we are able easily figure out our answer , which is the difference in amount of laundry between raymond and dave 400-100 = 300 .",

Let us find out how long it takes Ray to complete his laundry. It would take him twice as much time so he has to work for 2 hours to finish that part of the laundry. We know that David's laundry takes 1 hour while Raymond completes his laundry in 2 hours. Raymond spends 2 hours finishing his laundry while David only spent 1 hour. Subtracting 2 hours minus 1 hour equals 1 hour.",

To find raymond's contribution we take the equation and place 400 for s and solve to get r+400 =400 / 2 which means r=200-400 making r=-200 but negative amounts make no sense here so we switch places which makes raymond = 200. Our last step was asked to find the difference in the amount of laundry raymond and david will get which is 200-100 which means they would both do 100 pounds of laundry which means their amount equals 100-100=0. The difference between the two is therefore zero.",

But now we consider that he cleans twice the rate that david cleans...So now using the same exact formula as we did before, we can write R=(.5)(4(D)) which becomes R=2(.5)(D) [by commutativity], meaning that raymond does twice as much work as dave. So therefore...raymond=2(david) = 2(100) = 200. So 200-100=difference =100. So Raymond cleans 100 pounds more laundry than David.",
