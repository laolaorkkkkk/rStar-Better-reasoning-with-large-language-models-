Now, using substitution, replace Suzy's age into the equation. Then use multiplication. As mentioned earlier, it was stated that Suzy's iPhone is one year old. Then, multiplying it by 2 would give us the equation B=(1)(2). Solving this equation, we get B=2. Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Brandon's age by using division. First, take away four, which equals the quotient you want to achieve (Brandon\u2019s age). So if Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old (Ben), and the brandon's is 2 times older, then his (2) phone is eight years old (B)=(1)(2).

However, since we know the value of `ben` equals 2; all you need to do to get your answer is substitute the value into your equation (brandon equals `ben` multiplied by 4): brandon` equals `('2'*4), resulting in 'brandon equals 8'.

Subbing values in will yield Brandon's age which is `bronxdray` = 4+1 which equals 5. Conclusion Brandon's iPhone age would thus be 5 years old . Note : It looks like we may need to further simplify our equation so that the above conclusion yields a simple integer like five. For example: `(suzy)+(`ben``) = 4(1)` becomes `(1)+(2)=5 , and 5=(5).
