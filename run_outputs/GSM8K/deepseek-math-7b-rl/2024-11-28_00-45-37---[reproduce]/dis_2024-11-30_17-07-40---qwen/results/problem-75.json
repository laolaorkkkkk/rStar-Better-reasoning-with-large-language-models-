This last piece of information allows us to solve the puzzle: The sandcastles bottom level has a square footage equal to 4 times the overall square footage of the whole castle. However, according to the rule, each successive lower level doubles in size as the higher levels halve. Thus our solution for this particular problem is simply half, the fourth level of this castle is equal to one-half the size of the top most level, which yields us a fourth level with an area of 8 square feet. Our solution for this puzzle is 8 square feet",

Moving up another level would yield double the area again, resulting in a total of 32 x 2 = 64 square feet; finally, moving up yet one more level yields double once more, resulting in total 64 x 2 = 128 square feet, which is the area of the entire castle.",

We can verify this is correct by taking 0.5 times itself three times because 0.5^3 = 0.125 and 16/0.125=128.

How many blocks are there altogether? The number of blocks on each side of level n-1 is k-(n-1). Therefore, the top level is made up of $(k-n+1)^2$ blocks. The next level down contains $((k-n+2)^2$ but only half of those blocks lie within the boundaries of that level.
