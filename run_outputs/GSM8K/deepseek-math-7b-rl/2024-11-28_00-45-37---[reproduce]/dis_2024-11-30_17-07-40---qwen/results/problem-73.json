Once we figure this out, multiplying our results together will yield the interest charged the consumers.

Okay, assuming everything pays off on time in installments, so let's now go ahead and use that value .005 in calculating Shiela's cost over a longer period of time. She made several payments during the three months which basically constitutes the whole length of one quarter which makes things even simpler than the other method I used above. To put it simply let's calculate 1 times .005= .005 times 3= .015, which translates into saying Shiela will have paid around 0.015 portion of the original purchase sum by then, which also includes accrued interest. She has already paid an initial sum of 750 thus this reduces 0.015*750= 11.25 dollars making her remaining balance .750-11.25 which comes down to -$11.25 in dollar currency. Ah! I'm confused again here; why should I expect to see an amount less than zero here? Oh right... she's not able to afford that kind of expense. Not too likely actually though. Let me just clarify a thing, since this question is asking how much each month she'll be paying, well if she will be paying it on time then her total payments over those years should reduce to equaling her net total expenditure plus the 11.25 dollar interest which was already included within that amount. To make sure she won't ever owe anything yet again I'll calculate another amount. So say the total cost including both interest and installment plans would come down to 761.25 dollars and she wants to distribute it among four periods, namely each period consisting of three months or 1.5 months. So now if I divide 761.25 by 1.5 months, that gets me: 507.50 dollars per quarter. So let's take note of this for future reference: if she's paying on time then, let's say three quarters later, the remainder she owes is going to be 507.50 dollars but if this happens due to unforeseen circumstances before completion of the plan and she didn't pay as planned then this becomes a new variable she needs to calculate.

Therefore, the final result will be (1/4) * 2 = 0.5 or one-half which tells us what percentage is represented in one time interval or quarter of one year period in terms of per cent.

As it needs to be paid in monthly installments, we now need to find out the amount by which we can divide in every single installment that is required to be paid within one month duration.
