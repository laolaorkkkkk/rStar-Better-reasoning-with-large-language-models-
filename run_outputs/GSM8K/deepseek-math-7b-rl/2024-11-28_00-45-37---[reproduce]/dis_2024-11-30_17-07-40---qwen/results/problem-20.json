        " combined before the spill. Subtracting the water from the spilled orange drink (as we do not know precisely what the mixture is but assuming that if you take out a fraction of the whole mix, the same fraction is taken out of both components), we find the water content in the remaining orange is 20/3 - 4/3 = 16/3 litres. With this mixed volume of orange drink spilling to the pineapple, we know 16/3 + 9 = 16/3 + 27/3 = 43/3 litres of the total volume are made up by orange. However, the orange has actually run down into pineapple so our calculation must account for only the water. Thus, the amount of water becomes the original plus any water from the orange. So 43/3 + 9 = 43/3 + 27/3 = 70/3 litres or approximately 23.3 litres of water.",
        " so overall you have 9+6.67=15.67L's worth of pure water in your container, however when you spill a litre of the orange juice you have a reduced amount of liquid overall of twenty-four litres (24) but as it all turns out there will still be one litre spilled even after having mixed with the pineapple and thus would mean there is going to remain only eight litres worth of water as there would be three fourths of the pineapple juice instead of five fifths of the original juice leaving us a final equation for our quantity of pure water of:$$\\frac{3}{4}\\times24=18$$Finally the result obtained is a total of about seven point zero four litres as there are a fraction of a litre leftover and thus making it appear as a whole figure.",

To account for the change we divide $5.67/14.67=.387$, which represents our fraction left.
