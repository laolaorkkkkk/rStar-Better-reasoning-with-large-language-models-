Let me explain it another way : Let X= 60*6+40*4 ( the revenue made on Thursday) so x =$360+40 = $400 now if someone performs more tyres during the same period of time it will mean that more tyres require repair than others so it would make more sense to pay them less thus reducing the amount that one pays by purchasing cheaper tyres to reduce their overall costs . Thus when the next day (fri day) comes around ,he has more budget thus making him go for cheaper tyres and saving himself money compared to what the previous day made (400).

To calculate revenue from Friday: The mechanic was only responsible for cleaning car tires since no tires were taken from a car. Thus, the revenue earned was 12 x 40 is 480 dollars.
