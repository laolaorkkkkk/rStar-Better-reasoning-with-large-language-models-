Since 60 is even, take away one and divide by two.  59 \u00f7 2 = <<59/2=29.5>>29.5 , but we cannot have half of an ice cream carton so round down to 29 which means 29 boxes. But wait. You said earlier that there would be 60 servings total; we need to check if that works. If we multiply our result from above, <<15*29=435>>435, we won't get 60. So let's double check whether we need another box or not. Two more times that, if we add these together we'll get 60. <<15*30=450>>450, so no more boxes are needed. This will also make sure we don't lose the extra serving we calculated earlier. Now all we have to do is calculate the cost by multiplying 3 by the number of cartons bought. Now we only need to multiply 15 times four and then multiply the result by $4. We know this because the price of cartons was already mentioned.  3 x 4 = <<3\u00d74=12>>12. 12 \u00d7 $4 = <<12x4=$48>>$48",
