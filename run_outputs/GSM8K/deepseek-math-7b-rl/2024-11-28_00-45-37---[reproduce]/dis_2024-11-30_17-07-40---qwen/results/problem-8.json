This leaves him needing to cover 180 - 15 = 165 miles by the end of the 4th hour to reach home. Since he drives at 80 mph for this last part, we can calculate the exact distance covered during this hour, but the question asks only about the distance from home after 4 hours, not the distance covered. At the end of the 4th hour, considering all these distances, John is not yet at home but rather some distance from his house. To find out exactly, we would need to add up all the distances covered and subtract them from the initial distance (180 miles). However, since the exact distance isn't asked for, we conclude that the problem doesn't provide enough information for a precise answer without additional steps.",
        " First, let us figure out exactly how long he needed to keep traveling when he was initially stuck in traffic; remember to account for both lost traffic and waiting stoppages:  $$\\frac{180~\\text{miles}}{80\\,\\text{mph}}=2.25~\\text{hours}\\,.$$ Since he has already traveled for 4+2=6~\\hbox{hours}, our calculation reveals that he had 6-3-2.25=0.75 hours worth of remaining travel which must take place using his final mode of transportation ($v=\\frac{d}{t}$).",

After that, he drives at a speed of 30mph for half an hour, which covers 15 miles (half of 30). So now he's 180 + 120 + 15 = 315 miles away from his starting point. Finally, he travels at a speed of 80mph for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, covering 120 miles (1.5 * 80). So now he's 315 + 120 = 435 miles away from his starting point, or home.",

This leaves him only enough time to complete the rest of the journey at one point during, namely 10 minutes (halfway through the remaining 4 hours). This will allow us to calculate if he can actually reach his destination after covering the distance traveled in 2 full hour spent with no progress towards home. During those ten minutes spent traveling at 80 mph, he would move a total distance of 10/60*80=13.3 miles. This results in a difference of 15.25-13.3=1.95<2miles so John indeed managed to reach his intended location within the four-hour duration.",
        " right! And now since he didn't go anywhere till t=2 he keeps on going. But as per the stipulation he speeds up from t=2hrs to >0.5hrs (we'll leave it at half-way through our equation) ! Hence we need integrate to find acceleration at t=0.5.. .so lets see.. . 3t^2/2 evaluated at t=0.5 hrs. which results to the value 0.1875 miles . So effectively John only covers an actual distance of 180 - 0.1875 = 179.8125 miles. Lastly John continues to drive until he reaches his destination on the same path i.e. -he doesn't turn back .So at his final velocity V of 80 mph and taking into account the initial distance covered whilst staying stuck and the additional 0.5hr driving till finally having stopped moving , his displacement can be found out with following equation :=> s=vt+u  ...where s denotes the distance travelled during constant acceleration from an initial state (i.e. before t=2hrs when velocity starts changing). Thus: t=0.5hrs u=2*60 = 120  v=80 Therefore substituting values we get, s=80*0.5+120 = 160 m. Total Distance covered by John till t=4hrs = s+V*t1= 160+80*1= 240 miles . Hence total displacement after 4hr journey = 179.8125-240 miles which implies distance travelled back from starting point = 240-179.8125 miles = 60.1875 miles",

        "s, among other things. This isn't a productive activity anyway though for anyone using a car for work unless their job required them to drive out of town for work hours. Let's say your friend is trying to get to some business meeting but needs to take two days off of work to make sure she can find someone to fix a broken window. You drive for three days, and she drives only one day. You spend two days recovering what you missed while visiting someone else. But even after four days have passed, she still doesn't have a way to reach that meeting. The distance she could only get close to would depend on the distance between home and the meeting location. Assuming she started at 322miles away from home, after 4 days, she would be approximately 32miles behind, or 354miles away from the meeting spot. We might assume that the car gets 25 miles per gallon in city conditions and you use an additional 5 gallons of gas at the start of the day. Let's assume the price of gas was $4/gallon at that time, and that you paid gas station fees equal to $.50 per refill. Your share costed you 7.50+3(25)*$4=$320+.50=$320.50. But let's assume you also need $40 worth of gasoline for another trip you took later in the week. And $5 for any other minor trips you made later in the week. We'll assume that you also spent $20 fixing a tire problem as well to keep track of all the costs incurred along the way: 320.50+40+5+20=406.5. Therefore, the amount of gas you purchased is 406.5/25=16.26 gallons and cost 16.26*4=$65 which means you only got $65 worth of gas for free throughout the entire time period you traveled and thus the actual amount of money you actually put into purchasing fuel for every mile you drove on those 4 days (not including the initial purchase fee and the time spent filling up) amounted to 65-$320.50=$326.50.",

        " let us calculate the precise mileage John travels throughout the trip considering all relevant details mentioned therein. Firstly, John drove 180 miles ( i.e., ~ 3 hrs @ 60 MPH ) towards his destination ; yet was subsequently slowed down in traffic for only 3 hours while traveling alongside him who had driven at 60MPH continuously throughout; thus making it possible to estimate his instantaneous position as follows:- John has to go back 3 hours after which point ( at 1 pm ) he would like to reach his target within 3 hours . During that time, however, the vehicle ran into a small issue of road maintenance requiring him to pause his journey for half an hour (i.e. 15 min or 0.25 hrs ). This means he will need to finish off his journey covering only 5/6ths of its original duration (or at least make it timely enough till it finishes). This implies that once he covers (3-2=1)hrs & 30 minutes of travel, he will require 1 hr & 15 mins( i.e., 75 min or 1.25 hrs ) for the second half trip to reach his destination . Hence we proceed to carry out these calculations further : Considering above observations, he is not required to maintain his original speed during the period where he is travelling alone from his starting point to his turning point of 5/6th time taken ; hence he may simply take a break and resume his pace later on ; Thus, John ends up reaching his destination about 287.1km away from where he initially parked himself , which is equivalent to 455 miles !",

During the period he stands still, we don\u2019t change anything for him i.e. his position relative to his starting point remains zero. However, as the question states he spent the next half hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. In order to calculate the distance covered during this time, let us consider \u201cd\u201d as the number of miles traveled while standing still. As we know \u201cd=60miles\u201d From now onwards ,when he wants to move faster, he needs to cover 80 \u2013 d = 80-60 miles = 20 miles at a rate of 80 mph.

Well its quite difficult not to simply say in terms of miles per hour i.e. mph lets just assume he makes these stops evenly throughout his travels ie. not more than two additional stops per hr for simplicity sake. Also, if we consider that one thing im assuming is he spent even more hours than his 4 h specified thusly; he would be left waiting long enough to make up for all lost time in extra distance i.e. lets assume thats another 0.5h during which time he makes use of a vehicle at 40 mph in order to keep on track within this situation (ie. his average velocity changes). So lets now assume he takes 0.5 hours at 40MPH thus adding an additional 20 miles on top of his initial odometer reading of 180 (so he\u2019d be now at 200) plus his fourth leg at 30MPH so effectively; for a total of 4.5 hours travel of the last leg of 80MPH thus the effective miles driven during his last leg would be: 4 x 80 + 0.5 X 40= 380 thus he\u2019ll end up at 380miles.",

This leg involves two parts of John\u2019s trip starting when he finishes his initial return trip from his destination back to home base: the first bit of a longer-horizon segment involves him traveling for half an hour while his vehicle is not moving at a full 80 mph but rather merely standing still (he stops doing anything during this time). Obviously, if he doesn\u2019t move, then he isn\u2019t really leaving any distance behind as well... . The second bit of his long-ago trip takes place later still when he finally starts moving again and heads toward his desired destination once he begins driving once more towards home base.

Multiply the stop time (in hours) by John's rate of travel during this phase of his trip (since he doesn't move, the distance he travels is zero.) Finally, apply the same idea as described above again to compute the distance of travel at the end of the four-hour period.",
        " it took John overall (in hours) to travel back home. To do so: use the distance between locations as calculated previously ($180\\text{ miles}$) divided by the average speed over the return journey ($180\\div\\left(45+30+60/2\\right)\\approx 1.50\\text{ hr}$). Finally, calculate what the final result was (in miles), using John's return travel time ($1.5\\text{ hr}$) multiplied by his new speed (at home): $$d=r\\times t\\\\d=80\\cdot 1.5=120$$ Therefore, we add $120$, $315$ and obtain the result: ** $315+120=\\boxed{435}$ miles ",
        "$ hours.). Since part c asks for the distance one hour behind his origin, which can also be obtained by finding 315/2=157.5 miles (as noted in the comment section), my previous solution used $15+315$.",

Then he sped up and covered a distance of $(0.5\\times 30)+(80\\times 2.5)$ miles. Adding these together $(15) +(200)=215$. Thus he is 215 miles away from home. The real answer was probably not as simple as the real world can make it out to be. And no I am not assuming you were going wrong. But I think you are more likely to have miscalculated during those final moments. This happens often with mathematics problem solving. The best way to ensure yourself don\u2019t screw up such problems is to try it multiple times on paper first.",

Otherwise not .So assuming he was travelling away from home, since he spent only 'half' the time available travelling, I assume (or maybe not ?), he's gone closer to the 'home'. Thus making the math easier: he only goes back one less hour, thus 5+1=6hours; he can drive back to start & go 2 extra hrs into the problem too! (assuming its 'not raining all night')....but you could argue he'd've ended up further from home, right? Since rain is heavy down here and he's out in a desert area. Anyways, as always, unless otherwise noted, I'm presuming that the initial velocity he drove is irrelevant, because it seems his distance away and the direction he took does not change how close he gets to home. And since we don't know how far he went along with the extra travel due to poor traffic, either way I think we're safe, because if we know either he didn't move much and the initial conditions didn't hold true anymore, or else he moved further to the side than initially planned, the question is somewhat incomplete. But let's say he went exactly like planned, we can conclude that he is now a certain distance from home based on how long his journey takes."
