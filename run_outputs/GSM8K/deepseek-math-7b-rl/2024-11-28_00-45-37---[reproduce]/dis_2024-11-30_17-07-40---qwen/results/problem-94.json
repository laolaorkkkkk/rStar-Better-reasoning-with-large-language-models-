This is very easy to solve by the following formula: $(x/6)*22$ Here: x = The Price Of One Rabbit. Therefore, when we apply our formula in 182(x/6)*22, we get the right result because you multiply the amount by the price of all the animals and the only thing is 22*30...because (182 - 2*22), or (182 - 44).",

        " you know that there are twice as many cats as dogs (two dogs per cat), then you can calculate the number of cats. There are 120 cats (120 / 60 = 2). Since rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of cats and dogs, subtract 12 from 180 (120 + 60 = 180; 180 - 12 = 168). Therefore, there are 348 animals in total.",
        " 2x is the number of cats. The number of cats plus the number of dogs equals the number of pets. The information that the number of cats is 12 less than the combined number of cat and dog means that: Number of pets minus 12 = Number of cats which implies: Number of pets - Number of cats = 12. Using all of what we know so far (which is: Number of pets = 60+cat), you can replace 'Number of pets' by '60+2x' (or you could simply calculate total ",
        "So (60+120) - 12 = (180-12) = 168",

        " the ratio of cat to dog is 2 so there are 2D cats. As it says the number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, thus the number of rabbit pets R is equal to (Number of Cat)(+ )(Number of Dog) -12, so R = 2D +D - 12 =3D-12; as it is noted earlier 60 equals to D (number of dogs); Plug it over here; R = 2(60) +60 -12= 168 .

        " for each Dog and cat pair there would also be one rabbit. Therefore the actual total number of pets would be equal to $$\\text{Total}=180+\\frac{T}{6}(6)$$ which comes out to being$\\boxed{\\text{THREEHUNDREDFORTY}$PETS. (The 6th part is basically stating that out of those thirty six animals they must come in six pairs.)$",
        " The rabbit values was simply determined based on that one condition given..that said that is why they asked you to solve for the total animals instead of just having a rabbit to work on alone!. But don't forget your cats and dogs and all the fun I bet.",
        " is an algebraic question lets assign all variables we have (excepting the 3rd statement) as follows: A represents the amount of cats B represents the amount of dogs C represents the amount of rabbit We also need to find x because thats what lets us establish a connection between cats and dogs in our equation below: Let C represent cats (in terms of d) Let b represent dogs (and n) c=$\\frac{b}{2}$ And we're told to add the rabbit which is 60 and the cat's and dog's together so $C+D+b=60$ But since we're working in terms of D let's substitute the formula above: $\\frac{B}{2}$+$B$+$B$=$60$",

        "/2)=3$. As you can see, we actually derived an additional mathematical statement (which may or may not help us solve the question still ahead --as it turns out, unfortunately) and yet the problem itself doesn't state either the number of cats or the number of dogs. Therefore, in order to calculate the rest of our problem, I believe what we need to keep in mind here is that we are able to calculate total number of Pets based upon number of Dots already known plus number of Cats, which according to previous calculation is equal to three: (1)+(3). What we want to know though is total number of Dots that represents all possible combinations that we could possibly come up with, considering all that we're told about relation between Dots and Cats; hence $x+n=N$. From above calculation, we already know what C equals, namely $(N/2)$ or $\\frac{x+n}{2}$, which is basically a rephrasing of another form of equation of what we want in order to get the sum of Dots and Cats, since $x=n$, thus substituting '$n$' for the former '$n$' yields an equation of,$x+\\frac{n}{2}=N$, which equals $\\frac{3n}{2}=\\frac{60+n}{2}=\\frac{70}{2}=35$. Therefore, in addition to our previous calculations we now have an entirely independent conclusion stating that when number of Dots increase by a factor of two, total number of animals also increases (that is, directly proportional to one another). And thus, we finally yield our answer: \"Yes\" to part B . As to Part A though, we don't really care specifically how many animals there are altogether [although calculating it would have helped a bit] nor whether the solution is even correct--we're concerned only about proving that there exists enough cats to support the situation.",
