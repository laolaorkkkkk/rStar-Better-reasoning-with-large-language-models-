        " noted thus far only integers allowed assuming you\u2019re reading it through a normal sense not taking into account any unusual prices sometimes associated exclusively when purchasing multiple same exact thing over larger quantities like a dozen instead of a six but anyway we\u2019ll assume everyone knows basic arithmetic principles and conventions of rounding numbers etc. Therefore using integer division principle whereby whole numbers only can be involved without concern for remainders whatsoever hence we round down towards negative infinity when dividing two negative numbers eg: \u221218 \u00f7 \u22123 \u2248 \u22121.4 and floor(\u221218 \u00f7 \u22123 ) \u2248 6 because it\u2019s closer to zero than \u22122 therefore 6 represents your remaining fraction of a cake slice even though technically technically not a full portion yet suffice it will for our purposes consider such a fraction small enough relative to others thusly yielding approximated value: \u2192 $17\u00f7$8.5\u22482 .Hence indeed means you\u2019re buying exactly two boxes worth of pizza!",

        " up paying $50$ including the pizza, which means $$$$33+8.5P=$$$$$50, or in simple English it means the $$$$33 plus the money she spent on pizzas (what we just represented as '$'8.5P'$) add up into $$50$. Let's solve this equation for what '$P$'. Firstly, $$50-$$$33==$$$17$, so we're looking to find something called 'the inverse operation', 'undoing an operation' to get back to our original value. Since addition and subtraction work opposite of each other, subtracting $$33$ yields $$17$, so we know: $$$8.5P==$$$$17$. In fact, any time we start doing operations to a side of an equation such that those operations cancel everything happening on its side, the balance of the equation remains intact. Because the operations are being applied to both sides equally, whatever gets moved over onto another side equals whatever gets moved over to the other side. The result of doing those moves is that we've transformed this equation into $$$$8.5=17$, i.e., $$$$8.5=17$. The reason this works here can be understood by realizing that multiplying and dividing each side by a non-zero number also produces an equivalent equation. When we divide both sides of this new equation by $$8.5$, we end up getting $$$$17/$$$8.5=$$1$, hence $$$$P=1$. The answer is 1.",
