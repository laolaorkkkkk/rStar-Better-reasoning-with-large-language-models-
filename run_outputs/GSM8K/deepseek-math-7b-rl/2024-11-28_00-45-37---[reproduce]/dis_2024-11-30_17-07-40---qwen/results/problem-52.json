You want to divide the remaining $7.5$ pounds by the weight of one toy, i.e., $.5$ pounds per toy. In short, you want to solve the equation: `.5x=.5x*2=1*x=`? Well, here goes! ``` {.width=2cm} \\begin{aligned} .5x&=7.5\\\\ x &= \\dfrac{7.5}{.5}\\\\ \\end{aligned} ```. Since `/.5` yields a value equal to `x` divided by .5 (i.e., half) then this will also yield a value equivalent to double the desired outcome. Alternatively: Multiply by the reciprocal, which in this case happens to be the same thing as dividing by the current denominator. That is, multiply by the quantity `.5\\div.5`. To see why, note that `/.5=.5/x` where `x` is your unknown (as defined above). Multiplying both sides by `2/.5` will get you `2=` on the right side which simplifies down to `x=3` (for those of you who dislike cross-multiplying...). So multiplying both sides by `x/.5` gives `2=x` and solving for `x` yields `x=2`. To check whether this solution works, plug it back into the original equation (.5*(2))=.5*(x)).

That equals 7.5 pounds so that\u2019s how much weight remains that must be coming from the toys. But the problem states that each toy weighs 1/2 pounds so we can get how many toys it takes to balance 7.5 pounds by dividing both sides by $$\\frac{1}{2}$$, or multiplying by its reciprocal 2. Since $$7.5 * 2 = 15$$. This shows that 15 of these toys weighing half a pound each balances 7.5 pounds. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove **15 toys** in order to remove enough weight so that the weight remaining in his bag matches the target weight.",

So the equation we are solving is: 1/2x = 8 \u2013 7.5 Solve for x. Multiplying both sides by 2 we get: x = (8 \u2013 7.5) * 2 x = 0.5 * 2 x = 1 Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 1 toy.",

Thus, if the weight in pounds of the toys that can be removed equals 15 pounds minus the weight of the comics, we get the equation $$x\\text{pounds}+7.5\\text{pounds}=15\\text{pounds}$$ or $$x=7.5$$. However, since we are trying to find out how many toys he needs to remove to maintain a net weight removal of 15 pounds, we need to account for the weight of the toys as well. Given that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, and the difference is already accounted for by the comics (which weighed less), the equation remains as $$x = 7.5$$. Since each toy weighs half a pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is $$x = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15$$. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to reduce the baggy-ness to 15 pounds.",

Since our total weight should equal 15 lbs subtracting the comic weights we can set up an equation to solve for T. $7.5-T/2=15$. Solve for T. First add $$T/2$$ to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable on one side. This leaves us with $$7.5=15-T/2$$ Next multiply both sides by -2 to clear the fraction. $$-2*7.5=-2*(15-T/2)$$ Simplify. $-15=2(-15)+T$ Continue simplifying to find T.$-15=30+T$ Subtract 30 from both sides. $-45=T$ Therefore Uriah needs to remove 45 toys.
