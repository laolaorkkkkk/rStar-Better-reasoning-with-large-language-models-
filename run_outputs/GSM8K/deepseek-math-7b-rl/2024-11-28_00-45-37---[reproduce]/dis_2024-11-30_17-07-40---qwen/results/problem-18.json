Finally we divide this number by the number of eggs in a dozen, which is 12. We know that any number divided by 12 will result in a decimal point followed by what ever number comes after it in our division. So dividing 84 by 12 is just like multiplying 84 by 1/12 because anything over or equaling 1 when multiplied by something results in the same thing as multiplying by 1. Which means the only difference in 84 * 1/12 is in the way the numbers align in their decimals. To turn this into a mixed fraction, we need to first find the greatest multiple of twelve before 84. The factor pairs of 12 are (1,12), (2,6), (3,4) and (4,3). We see that 84 * 1 = 84 and 84 * 2 = 168; however, 84 * 3 = 252 and 84 * 4 = 336. Since 336 is greater than 84, then our denominator is going to be greater than 4. Since 4 x 12 = 48, the whole part of the number will come before this fraction. So 84 divided by 12 is just 7.
