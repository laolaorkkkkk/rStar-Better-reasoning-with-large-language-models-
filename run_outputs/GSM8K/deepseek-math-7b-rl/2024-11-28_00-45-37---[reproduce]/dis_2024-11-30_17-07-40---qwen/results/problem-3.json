One session comes out to 180 meters which needs to be multiplied into his entire workout time to get the amount of time he spends on any given week. It's basically (60*3) x (the number of weeks) since each time he does it he would spend 180 seconds to complete the work in a certain amount of time. We can conclude it equals to about 5 hours to finish up the entire workout because 1 hour has roughly four quarters so we just multiply the remaining fractions by the original value and see what part of an hour that would put us somewhere near. But I'm actually not sure because I don't know what exactly the question wants so let me say it again: It may take 180 minutes on a weekday or it could take a minute per each of the 21 sprints on a weekend day (which would equal to approximately 33).

But since this is how far he runs in a single session over and over again every week we just keep multiplying by however many sessions he runs over and over again, or our variable(x) which is 3 for this problem.  You can use any number for our 'x' but when using numbers like these it is safe to add parenthesis around your numbers when you perform any multiplication so it looks nice. This makes our equation look something like (60 x 3) x 3.  We know that this is the same thing as (180) x 3 because we already multiplied everything else except for the second '3'. This allows us to simplify it even further and make it look even nicer on our paper (180 x 3)x3 and since there are no signs or parentheses left on our new equation we can simply multiply them directly 180 x 3 x 3 and what this yields out to be is 1620.
