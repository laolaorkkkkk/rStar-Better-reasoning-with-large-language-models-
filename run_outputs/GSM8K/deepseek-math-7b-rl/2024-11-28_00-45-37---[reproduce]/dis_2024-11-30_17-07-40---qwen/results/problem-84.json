By knowing this is going to be four since they won 8 more than the loss of 3. And if we add 4 (win) + 3 (loss), that makes 7. We still don't know our total, but what I'm saying now tells me that when I reach my sum of seven, I want to restate what I am doing so it'll be logical. Here are examples of similar equations: X+Y=Z (we already explained this one). Then Z=X-Y (so you have all the numbers except your variable. So if you wanted your variable alone, that means that you just need to flip it over to go opposite or make it negative. So if we have 8-X=Y (this time we have numbers on both sides of our variable X. To get rid of the number 8, we would subtract something from this to bring us down to zero. That would mean we would need to flip it over.

So like X=-(-8)+Y (the negative 8 cancels out the -x being multiplied by x, leaving us with x=8+Y.

So let's start this problem again here. 8+X=22 because we are told that they played 22 games in total. So once again to isolate for X we need to do the opposite (or move it to another side) and the way we do this is by adding a negative sign to the whole expression to show that we're flipping its position. This gives us -(8+X)=-(22) . Then what do we do next? Well we can either take care of the inside parentheses first with PEMDAS and work right, which means putting the addition sign on 8 and X first to simplify it, before moving onto the subtraction (-) . Or else, you could just take care of PEMDAS while working with integers right away because multiplication and division happen when dealing with those positive/negative signs, which means that instead of just multiplying everything right away (like PEMDAS says to do order",
