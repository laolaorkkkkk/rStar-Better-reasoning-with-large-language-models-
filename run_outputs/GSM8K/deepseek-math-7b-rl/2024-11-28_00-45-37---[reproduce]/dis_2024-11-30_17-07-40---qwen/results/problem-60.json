Now that we\u2019ve determined how many items can actually potentially be included within said category of apples once again let\u2019s look at the given details pertaining to any specific individual apple found amongst this population listed here above specifically. Firstly; the statement tells us that 2 out of the 200 fruits are sour, but not necessarily these same two oranges. Likewise we don\u2019t see mention of how many of the unripe oranges are actually red. All of that information is irrelevant though because regardless of anything else this single group remains unaffected solely by any one piece of fruit chosen at random from the pool. In fact; if we had somehow managed to randomly select multiple apples out of the pool at hand and observe whatever characteristics were present upon their surface without ever knowing of their exact contents. None of this data provided in said particular problem set would enable us to deduce whether or not any of the non-sour, not-rotten, and not-badly-misted apples selected from said population exhibit signs of any respective physical condition which would indicate potential health concerns. Therefore unless otherwise stated, by virtue of what the author has offered we can assume that every item falls into at least one of the following groups: - Good Apples: As per previously established calculations there are thirteen individuals currently listed under this subset group having already been removed from consideration regarding this particular type of classification. This means that eleven more must exist and remain unaccounted for however, unfortunately, based upon whatever level of detail presented above it would be impossible for us to ascertain the identities of these members of said group due entirely to the absence of pertinent information available beyond the facts established earlier upon them including their association with their former state prior to their removal from the general discussion initiated above.",

However, since we already counted the two sour oranges in the unripe ones (which may or may not be distinct), we need to adjust this calculation. Assuming the sour and unripe oranges are disjoint sets (i.e., no orange is both unripe and sour), the adjustment would simply be accounting for the fact that any oranges that are counted in both categories (unripe and sour) are subtracted twice. Therefore, the number of good oranges is calculated correctly as $22-1$ for the unripe oranges plus the 19 non-sour and non-unripe oranges, resulting in a total of $20$ good oranges.",

The only other thing you need to realize here is that since there are exactly two oranges which are both sour and bad, it follows that out of the 10 oranges which are already accounted for as either unripe or spoiled, none are bad, so therefore, only the good remaining oranges count toward our solution. So we're down to finding the number of oranges which remain good among the remaining 17 oranges, but since it's already been taken care off of all those which are not good, there's no way of further reducing our calculations here, we just need to subtract the oranges that are still yet to be counted.
