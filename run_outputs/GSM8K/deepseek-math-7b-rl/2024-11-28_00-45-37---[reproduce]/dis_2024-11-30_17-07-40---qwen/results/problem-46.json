However, since we cannot have half a post-it note, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the problem.

Thus, we begin $$0=(80+P)+220$$ and continue by isolating $P$: $$0-P-200=220\\implies -P=-220-200\\implies -P=-420$$$$P=\\boxed{420}\\,$$ which is pretty convincing because she could only have bought whole packages of 100 notes.",

        " so you add 220 to both sides: $$80 + P = 243,$$ then subtract 80: $$P = 163.$$ Again, though, you recognize this answer cannot be quite right because we would already know if she didn't have any, because she only got two. Try once more. Rewrite the original equation, expressing it entirely in terms of variable amounts rather than using a single unknown: $$P + (B - \\text{cups}) = L.$$ Since we now know about every element of this equation except P, we're ready to solve for it: $$P + (80 - 220) = 23,$$ so first subtract 80 from both sides: $$P - 140 = 23,$$ and then add 140: $$P = 163.$$ Once again, though, this answer seems wrong because she couldn't have used them on anything. To find P, we need to start with the equation $(cups + P) = (B - L)$ (the quantity of post-it's placed equals the quantity of posts it's started with minus the posts it ends up with). So here's another approach. Write down the equations in English: Starting with: $B =$ original quantity of post-its End with: $L =$ remaining quantity of post-its Purchased: $P =$ quantity of post-its purchased Subtracting quantity put on top of cups from the starting and ending quantities yields a new equation. $P + B - cups = L$. Solve this last equation algebraically and express the value of P in terms of B, L, and cups. We already know everything else in this equation apart from P itself; all of the rest is known. Substitute the values that we do know into the equation and see how well you did. Finally, substitute back for $B, L$, and $cups$. $B$ is already given, but since we solved for P above, we'll just write $$P = 80 + L - 220$$ so $B = 80$ and $L = 23$ plug these into the above equation yielding $P = 80 + 23 - 220$. Solving this simple arithmetic problem, we get $$P = -117.$$ Clearly, this doesn't make sense mathematically or logically since $P$ cannot be negative or a",
        " up being incorrect. To avoid this mistake, revisit the question: What is asking us? Specifically, what is telling us about the situation? First, we know that Candice put 80 post-it notes into her purse before leaving to work. These were called out already earlier in the text. Second, we see that she had 220 cups of coffee to place the post-its on. Lastly, she had 23 left over when the task finished, as stated earlier in the problem. Revisiting the equation now should allow for a better understanding. The correct equation using our newfound variables is: $$80 + P - 220 = 23.$$ Simplifying this gives us $80 + P - 220 = 23$, which simplifies further to $P = 23 - 80 + 220 = 163$. Wait, isn't that...nope, we can't have three hundred sixty-three post-its!!! Our initial assumption was incorrect, and our variable definitions were misleading. Let's rethink this: since we're looking for the number of post-its purchased, let\u2019s define our variables differently. Define what $P$ is first, as it\u2019s dependent on the rest of our values. Let $P$ equal the number of post-its purchased. Using our new value definitions, our corrected equation becomes $B - (cups - L) = P$. Substituting our knowns, we have: $$80 - (220 - 23) = P.$$ Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses first gives us $80 - 197 = P$, which leads to $P = -117$. Uh oh, something isn\u2019t right either. A negative number of post-its doesn\u2019t make sense in this context, so we need to reassess our equation once more. The error here lies in how we translated our English statement into an algebraic equation. The correct approach is to understand what we\u2019re actually trying to find and translate that directly into the equation. We want to determine the total number of post-its purchased, not just the excess over the desired outcome. Thus, the equation should accurately reflect this by focusing on the initial post-its added, the cups placed upon, and the leftover amounts. Adjusting our understanding yields: $$B + (cups - \\text{end points}) = P + L.$$ Simplifying the parentheses correctly now provides us",

Insert the known values: $P=(80)+220-23$. 3. Evaluate using order of operations: $P=377.$ However we must remember that a package contains 100 notes. Thus we need to divide: $\\frac{P}{100}=3.77\\approx4.$",

That would be \\[U=P+220.\\] This can't work, because we already knew that having 23 on hand is not enough to fill 220 cups! Since 23 includes the notes in the package and those in other cups, this can't be possible either. However, if we assume that she had $220+P-23$ notes remaining overall instead of $80+P-23$, we would have \\[(220+P-23)-(23)=220,\\] meaning that when she got home at the end of the day, she did not have any left over! To recap, we just figured out the missing value required so that if we were to add the old notes ($U$), those contained in that package and those found on individual cups ($P$) minus the final amount ($L$), everything adds up nicely. Therefore we plug those into the first equation above to get \\[(220+P)+(220-P)=220, \\] which simplifies to: \\begin{align*}",

        " posts it notes were enough to cover 220 of the coffee cups. Since each coffee cup got a post-it note, this totals to 220 post-its covered over the coffee cups.

        " initial equation based on the total number of post-its left over ($80+P-23=220$), let us consider instead the amount of them actually used, since we know the ending balance. The number of Post-It's used during the course of the day must equal the difference between the initial package of post-its bought (say, $p$, which we don't know at the start) and the number put onto the 220 cups of coffee (which we do know). We know, however, that all of those cups only needed 1 post-it note each. Therefore, $p-220$ is the exact same value as $80+P-23$. We may write $$p-220=80+P-23,$$ or $$p-220+57=p+P$$ because $(80+P-23)$ simplifies to $(p+P),$ the total post-its used during the course of the day, according to the second paragraph above. Subtracting 103 from each side yields $$p=p-P.$$ This tells us something quite bizarre: no matter what happens during the day, you'll always use up exactly the same amount of post-its. This doesn't make sense at all--the situation clearly has the potential for infinite variation depending on what actions are taken or not taken on the part of the customer or seller. However, in this context, if we want to avoid the impossibility of this happening, we need to look at something else. Upon careful analysis, we realize that what initially seemed like something quite absurd has boiled down to saying $$\\text{Post-Its used}=\\text{total post-its left}+\\text{total post-its sold}.$$ This implies that the entire original package is available to the customers, since the problem tells us that after putting those 220 onto their drinks, she'd have nothing left, indicating no post-its were wasted. Thus, she actually used up all of 100 post-its. Since she had 23 left, this means she must have bought exactly 23 additional packages! $$0=P-220=23 \\implies P+220=243.$$ I hope this explanation is still clear even though it may feel somewhat complicated to me.",

Let's consider this correctly. We know she had 80, used 220 (of which she kept some), and ended up with 23. The actual calculation would be: 220 (used) + 23 (left) = 243 post-it notes in total needed. Since she started with 80, the package must contain 243 - 80 = 163 post-it notes. But this doesn't account for the fact that she could not possibly have used all 220 posts without running out. Let's correct this: if she ended up with 23 post-it notes in addition to the initial 80, the number of post-it notes used must be adjusted accordingly. The correct adjustment is to see that the package plus the 23 leftover post-it notes equals the 243 needed. Since she didn't use all 220 post-it notes, the package must contain exactly 243 - 80 = 163 post-it notes, but only 163 - 220 (since that's what was actually used) means she didn't exceed her initial supply. Thus, the package must contain the remaining unused number: 243 - 80 = 163. The revised solution should match the initial logic but ensure accuracy: let's reconsider: If she ended with 23 post-it notes including any left over from the purchase, and considering the total needed matches the calculation, the correct package count remains consistent: \\(243 - 80 = 163\\). This ensures consistency without exceeding inventory. The answer is: \\(\\boxed{163}\\).",
