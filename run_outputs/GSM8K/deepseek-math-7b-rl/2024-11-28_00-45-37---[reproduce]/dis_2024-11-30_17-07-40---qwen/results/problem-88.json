        " know this. Let\u2019s name Harald\u2019s sales H and Marilyn\u2019s record sales 10H since she sells 10 times as many records. If their total sold was 88,000, we can write an equation. We\u2019re looking at: H + 10H = 88,000. That means: 11H=88,000. 88,000 divided by 11 equals H or: H=8,000. Marilyn sold 8,000 records but you asked Harald\u2019s record sale so all we need to do is find out what 1/11 of 88,000 is, that will tell us how many records Marly\u2019s sold. Well 1/11 of 88,000 is 8,000; therefore: Harold sold 8,000 records. The answer is: 8,000.",
