Finally, determine the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. We subtract the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the remaining students: $16 - (4 + 4) = 8$.

        " dance, that\u2019s 0.2 x 20 = 4 students. That means 16 students (20 - 4) remained for jazz dance. Since 25% of these students enroll in jazz dance, it\u2019s 0.25 x 16 = 4 students. This leaves us with 12 students for hip-hop dance out of the original 20. To find the percentage, divide 12 by 20, which equals 0.6 or 60%. However, there seems to be a miscalculation; let's correct it: The correct calculation for hip-hop dance should be based on the remainder after accounting for jazz dance. Since 20% of 20 students are in contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining 16 are in jazz dance, we calculate the number in hip-hop dance as follows: First, find the number not in contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16. Then, find the number in jazz dance: 0.25 x 16 = 4. Subtracting this from the non-contemporary dancers gives us the number in hip-hop dance: 16 - 4 = 12. To find the percentage, we calculate 12/20 = 0.6 or 60%, but this is incorrect because it doesn't account for the correct distribution. Let's recalculate: 20% of 20 is 4 (contemporary), leaving 16. 25% of the remaining 16 is 4 (jazz), leaving 12 (hip-hop). To find the percentage, we calculate 12/20 = 0.6 or 60%. My previous explanation was incorrect; the correct approach is to subtract the percentages directly from 100% after converting them to decimals. Starting with 100%, we subtract the 20% for contemporary dance, leaving 80%. Then, from the remaining 80%, we subtract the 25% (or 0.25) for jazz dance, which is actually 20% of the original 20 (since we're looking at the remaining population before recalculating), leaving us with 60% for the hip-hop group. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 60%, but the explanation needs to be corrected to reflect that 60% comes",

Therefore, (5/20-4/20)-12=88%, so 88 students are not enrolled in Contemporary + Jazz, which represents 88 students because the sum of these percentages cannot exceed 100%. This means the remaining 12 students are enrolled in Hip-Roop Dance, which represents (Hyp-Hip)=4%.",

Thus, if we know that 16 people are left then we can take away the number of students who enroll in jazz from 16 people to get how many enroll in hip-hop dance.
