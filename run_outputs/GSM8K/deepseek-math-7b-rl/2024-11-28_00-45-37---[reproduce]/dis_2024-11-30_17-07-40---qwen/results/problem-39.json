Therefore, she walks for 2 hours at a speed of 3 miles/hour, which means she covers 2 x 3 = 6 miles while walking. Additionally, she runs for the other 2 hours. As running is three times slower than walking, her running speed is 1 mile per hour. Running for 2 hours at this speed would cover an additional distance of 2 x 1 = 2 miles.

We are only asking about a close approximation so let\u2019s round that up to just 0.67 instead of going on forever. This gives us 2.02 or approximately 2 minutes total time spent walking (this doesn\u2019t add up though since it is not exact). To figure out how many miles Dana can travel, we need to find her speeds. We know how fast she skips; she can skip at three miles per hour. We know the equation to solve for distance if we know the unit rate (speed) and total time: distance=unit rate x total time. To find the unit rates of her walking and running we know that \u201cfour times faster\u201d means we must multiply by 4 to find the units for the walking speed and multiply by ten to find her running speed because she runs ten times slower than she jumps. This is why I multiplied by 10 and not by 4 here. So now let\u2019s start writing our equations and substituting what we know. First let's tackle her skipping speed. We know her skipping rate is three miles per hour, which means in one hour she travels three miles. We can write that as an equation like this: 3 = s(walk), and now substitute three for s(walk) to solve. This tells us that the rate (distance/time) at which she walks is three miles per hour (s(walk)= mph). Next let\u2019s talk about her running rate. We\u2019ll plug into our equation our information here. Because the equation tells us that s(walk)*w = distance (where w is the time walked), and we found that s(walk)=mph, we can plug those in. Therefore, 4*(s(running))*2/3 = distance, and that equation simplifies to s(running) = mph. Finally, let's talk about how far Dana can walk (the total length of the journey). Using the same equation as before, s(running)*r(walk)*time(walk), when you substitute your values in, it simplifies to r(300 miles), so that\u2019s all of",

Lastly, we need to remember that she skips for half her running time. Therefore, that would mean she skips for only half the time she spends running which is 1 hour or that it takes her 1 hour to make 3 trips since 3 miles = 1 hour she would take only 1 hour to walk.

The way to do this would be the following, \u00bc multiplied by 6/6 = 6/24, which simplifies to 1/4 since both the numerator and denominator go evenly into itself by 6. Since one fourth of the trip involves walking, we also use \u2154 of 6/1 time or 4/6 * 2/3 to get to our walking portion of the trip or 8/18. To convert that back into minutes, simply move the decimal point one place past the second number. Therefore, 8/18 converts into about 48 minutes.

We are told Dana can skip 3 miles per hour so what? Well first off, if skipping takes 1/2 times more speed than she can run that means skipping takes her 6 miles per hour to make it twice as fast as walking (and she walks four miles per hour). Skipping allows Dana to cover farther than she can run, but she still has to get back into motion and start to walk again, so if Dana skips the entire amount of time (4 hrs) she will travel 4*6=24 miles before she starts walking (and you want to know what distance she travels before she starts walking, not overall). Now that we know how far Dana can skip in 4 hrs we\u2019re gonna ask ourselves if we\u2019ll need to take a break during this time so we have a bit of time when she can walk at least as fast as we move, or maybe even run faster, which I guess she won\u2019t (let's just assume her walking speed is constant at 4 miles/hour, 0.67 mph to be precise), so now we need to see whether we would be able to walk 6 miles in less than one third of that time (which is the same as asking whether we could do so in two thirds of the time, or 4 hours, of which we already have 4 and are yet to begin.) It turns out we can, though we\u2019ve already said that if she skips 4 hrs she travels 24 miles, that means she has 6 hrs remaining and if she walks at four miles an hour for all those additional hours, 6 hours worth of travel at 4 mph equals 24 miles, so Dana can run for 4 hrs and walk for another 6 hrs\u2026so she can run 4*(12 mph)=48 miles, and she can walk 24 miles and get back into motion and keep going.

So if she skips at 3 miles/hour, then the skip would equal to her walk speed. So her skip would be 3 miles per hour. Now we just need to know what she could run in two hours. Since her skipping speed is half of her run speed and we know that her skipping speed is three miles/hour, her run speed would therefore be six miles/hour (as that would result in half the skipped speed).
