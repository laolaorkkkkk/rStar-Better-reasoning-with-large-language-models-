Since he does this three times a week, he spends a total of 9 hours per week on TV and reading (3*3). Finally, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4 (9*4), which equals 36. So, the answer is 36 hours! ",
        " half would just be one hour. So its 2 hours reading and 2 hours reading. 2+2=4. Its 4 hrs reading. 3x4= 12. That means for the entire week it will be 12 hrs. Then you just multiply by four and get 48. The answer is: 48.",

Since he reads 3 hours each week, he spends 3\u22174=12 hours reading over four weeks. Adding the time he spends watching TV, we get 12+24=36 hours. The answer is : 36.",

That means he spends $6+3$ hours daily, or $9$ hours per week (since we have the original formula of $6+3=9$). If he does this activity four weeks instead of one, his total spending would be $9*4$ which simplifies to $36$.",
