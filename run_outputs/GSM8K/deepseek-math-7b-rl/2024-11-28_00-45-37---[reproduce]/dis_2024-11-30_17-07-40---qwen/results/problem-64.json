T = Distance / Speed or T = 150 miles / 48 mph = 3.12 hours. Since we want to find the remaining time and we are already traveling at 8 mph, we have to subtract the current travel distance (which is 100 miles) and divide this difference by the original speed: (150 - 100) \u00f7 8 = 25 \u00f7 8 \u2248 3.125. Our resulting value matches our previous calculation exactly, so this seems right. However, we actually didn't make any mistakes in our calculations, so let's go back over what we wrote down. This problem was about finding the time until they reach their destination at a constant speed of 48 miles/hr, but when we subtracted the current travel distance from the total distance, we ended up with a different result than expected, leading us to conclude that perhaps something went wrong earlier in our solution process. Upon revisiting our initial steps, we realize that our mistake lies in calculating the remaining distance correctly after the second part of the journey. While the first part of the journey resulted in Sophia covering 100 miles, leaving her with a remaining distance of 300 miles - 100 miles = 200 miles, she still needs to cover the remaining 50 miles to reach her destination. Therefore, instead of subtracting 100 from 200, which leads to an incorrect remaining distance, we need to find how long it takes Sophia to cover the remaining 50 miles at a speed of 48 mph.
