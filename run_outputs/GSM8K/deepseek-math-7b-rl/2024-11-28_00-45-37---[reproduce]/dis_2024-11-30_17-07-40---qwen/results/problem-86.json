        " three times as long as the first, the alarm rang 3 X 4 = 12 times. Lastly, during the last third period, the alarm rang half as much as during the first period; therefore, it only ran for 1/2 X 4 = 2 times.",

On the second occasion, it rang for three times as long as the first occasion which means that the bell would have rung (i.e., gone) 12 (=4*3) rounds because we know that on the first occasion, the bell rang four times (or loops), so each loop of the bell represents 1 unit. Now, the question said that on the second occasion, the bells ran (loopsed?) once as 12/(12/3)=3 rounds; on the third occasion, the bell ran 6 (=3/2) rounds.. So altogether, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.",

        " last round of sounds was five periods long, 2.25 rings. As such, you add up the rounds of sound of all three instances to figure out how many times the alarm clock sounded, which is equal to 4 (first) plus 12 (second) plus 6 (last), and equals 22 overall.",
