Thus we need to add both velocities which results in 16 mph. Now let's figure out the distance again. It depends upon how much time he took to reach 4 pm from 1pm. So we need to calculate time needed to travel this new distance back to its starting point. This distance is going to decrease as the velocity becomes less than half of it's initial velocity or till it's reached 0 speed when we see that the ships will come near the place from where it had travelled away since we've calculated distance previously when velocity was at maximum. So this part requires little tricky calculation for us to do so that the ships meet each other again from where they started out as they just switched speeds for returning and thus their meeting points are determined and the time taken by them to meet is just required here. Here we see that it takes only half the time as compared to the outward journey.

Once again, we can apply the same method as last time: Distance divided by rate equals time. Since the distance from A to B is 10x miles, the time it takes him to go back again at 6 mph would equal 10x/6. This equals approximately 1.67x.

When he returns, his speed changes to 6 mph and he travels the same distance back, so it takes him (10t / 6) hours to return. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to calculate the time difference between the time he starts his journey and the time he reaches point B again. Let's assume he starts at 1 PM, then he arrives at B at (1 + t) PM. The time to return is t, so the arrival time is (1 + t + t/3) PM.

By solving this formula in terms of time, you get Time = Distance / Velocity. Because we know the distance (d) is 30 and the velocity (v) is 6 mph, we'll plug these numbers into our equation. This means that the number of hours it took Tom to come back is: 30 divided by six which is five.

To find out how long it took him to return, we use the same equation as before but this time our known variables will be 6mph (the speed on his return trip) and 30 miles (the distance between points one and four). Plugging these values into the equation tells us that it would have taken Tom approximately 5 hours to return.",
        " So it will take him Time = Distance/Rate To Get Back. Which I Would Do 30/6 mph=5hrs To Get Back. It Takes His Ship 5 Hrs To Get Back",
        " It Takes Twice As Long As Coming Back At 10mph To Do So.  So We Take Away Threehrs (for Going Out Going Backward=6mPhr*??hours) *2=6hours.",
        " So The ",
        " Of Speed (10-6MPH), Get It? ",
        " 360 MILES TO POINT A (4 HOURS AT 10 MPH) AND THEN BACK FROM POINT A. THE return distance is HALF OF THAT DISTANCE...180 MILES. Then you just divide that Distance of Return Time Of Return Distance 240 MILES OVER That Rate...THE Return Time Is 240 HOURS INVERSE THE_return_ TIME OF TravelTime OF Forwarding 4 HOURS*240 / 10...THATgives 96 MINUTES THA_TIS_ 96 MINUTES BACK.",
        " going backwards....and the return time will equal 30Miles/6mph=5 HOURS...So..Total Time...forward plus backward...(3HOURS+5HOURS)=8 HOURS...",
        " SIX MPH...which means we make our journey back in (30MI /6 MP) = 5 HOURS....Therefore our round trip takes us 5+3=8 HOURS",
        " that formula we have a distance that equals: (10MPH)X(3.7HOURS)=37MILES......So going forth @ a fast rate and going backward @ a slow rate...how does that apply?...it means that if your destination is 37 miles away, you're only able to get a short way back....so let's assume that Tom returns the ship 3 miles behind its starting point (not actually possible). That would mean that he traveled 37-3=34 miles returning toward the ship..at an average pace @ 6 miles per hour....so dividing (34miles)/(6mph)...we have the time needed to reach his destination as ... (approximately) .57 hours..but remember we wanted that ship to return to the starting point...not go 3 miles back...so this result above is also an approximate value ..we must add another 0.3 hour(s)..since the above calculation assumes that he'll be traveling the original distance which was calculated above for (30miles)... so we have: (approximately) .57+(0.3) = .87 hrs or approximately .87 hours to get back .87hrs x 60 min/hr = approximately 52 minutes TO RETURN the ship to the starting point..."
