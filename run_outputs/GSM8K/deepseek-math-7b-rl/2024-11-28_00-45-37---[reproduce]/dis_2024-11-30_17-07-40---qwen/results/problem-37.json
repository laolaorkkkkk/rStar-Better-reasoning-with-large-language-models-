This means he used 30 / $20 = 1.5 times his video game budget. Since he can't buy half a game, he actually bought 1 whole game and had some extra money left over ($35 - $20). To find out how many games he can buy, we look at how many games he could buy with the leftover money ($35), not including the last whole game. So, $35 / $20 = 1.75. Since he can only buy whole games, he bought 1 game and had some money left over ($35 - $20 = $15). Thus, he has 13 (initial) - 5 (sold) - 1 (bought) = 7 lego sets left.",

However, since we know the calculation was wrong based on the remaining money, let's correct it: John sold a total of 8 video games worth $160 and had $5 left over, so he actually had $165 worth of items in total before buying the games. He initially had 13 lego sets worth $195. Selling lego sets costs $15 each, and knowing he has enough to cover the $160 spent on games plus the $5 left, he must have sold exactly the number of lego sets that equals $165 ($160 for games + $5 surplus).

However, since he already sold all his lego sets, we calculate how many he bought or has left by dividing the amount he spent by the cost per game: $195 / $20 = 9.75, rounding down to 9, as he cannot buy a fraction of a game. Therefore, he only buys 8 games, leaving him with 13 - 9 + 8 - 8 = 4 lego sets remaining.",
        " on video games. He ended up with $5 left over. So his starting amount was 195 - 160 + 5 = $40. He initially bought 8 video games for $20 each. Let's find out how much money he had before buying the video games. His initial budget was $195. After spending $160 on videos, he had $195 - $160 = $35 left. He now has $5 left. So before spending on video games, he had 35 + 5 = $40. Since 40 / 15 (legos per dollar) equals approximately 2.67, rounding down, John has approximately 2 lego sets left. However, since we're dealing with whole numbers of legos, we need to adjust our calculation to account for the precise amount of money he had at each step. We can see from the calculation above that he must have had exactly enough money to buy the 8 games and still have the remaining 5 dollars, meaning he could not have sold any additional legos without exceeding his remaining balance. Therefore, the correct approach is to calculate the exact number of legos he has after selling and before purchasing the video games. From the initial sales, he had $195, which covers the cost of the videos ($160) and leaves him with $35 ($195 - $160). Adding the $5 he has left means he actually had $40 ($35 + $5), which matches his initial budget for legos divided by their price ($20) is 2 legos, but this doesn't align with the problem as stated, indicating a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the direct application of division. Given the context, it seems that the question intends for us to focus on the final distribution of wealth rather than the precise count of legos. Thus, we focus on the leftover money rather than directly calculating the exact number of legos.

The correct approach is to first calculate how much he spent on games and what he had leftover: $160 (cost of games) + $5 (leftover) = $165. This confirms his total expenditure. To find out how many legos he sold, we look back at his initial sale earnings: $195. Subtracting the cost of games ($160), we get $35.

The correct interpretation is that the $30 represents the remaining amount after buying the video games and calculating the leftover money.

He spent $160 on video games, leaving him with $35, but since he has $5 left, he spent $30 on games.
