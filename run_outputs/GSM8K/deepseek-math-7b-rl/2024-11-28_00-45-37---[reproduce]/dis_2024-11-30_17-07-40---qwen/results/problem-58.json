We can't buy stuff over $40 therefore we need to look beyond that point in our calculation since it would result in an incorrect price for us to sell the whole amount at, just making use of a few rules of algebra to see where the problem lies here: We don't want to get into an endless battle of 'how much of my product will turn profit?' Let's just consider how much money I'd make if sold everything...So let me assume that selling all products gets me $40 profit per dollar made and let me ignore taxes, fees, royalties etc., in simplifying matters. We'll call such profit $P$. So, $P$=$40$ and $(1-P)(1.25)$ represents loss for not getting all the items properly put together (no discounts and no free shipping). Thus, $(1.25P)$ represents the value I receive in loss which is less than my desired $40. However, I know I still want my item and hence I want to return them. Well, I have enough leftover to give you an extra $4 back to compensate for the fact that I didn't sell everything I produced. Therefore $(1.25P)-4$ is what comes out of my balance. What this tells me, without knowing anything about the specific cost structure of my company, is that I have exactly what I need to return all items sold! Which means, if I had to sell everything for $40 profit, I would definitely achieve this goal. We then have $$\\dfrac{(1.25P-4)}{4}$$ as the overall percentage required to sell my produce which means the same thing as the percentage required for making profits off everything being $\\frac{P}{40}$. That is, I have set P equal to 40 as a requirement. Now let's figure out the original question. We have the expression $40+\\left(\\frac{125x}{100}\\right)$ where we're adding the cost from selling everything as well as the percentage that needs to exist in my stock that I'm willing to trade off my desired $40 to make this all work out for me.
