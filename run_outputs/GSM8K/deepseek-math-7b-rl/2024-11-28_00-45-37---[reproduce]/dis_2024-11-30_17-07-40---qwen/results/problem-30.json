        " be $11x$. Their total age is now 162. So we can write the equation: \\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \\] Simplifying, we get: \\[ 18x = 162 \\] Solving for $x$, we find: \\[ x = 9 \\] So Allen's current age is: \\[ 11x = 11(9) = 99 \\] And $10$ years later, Allen's age will be: \\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \\] ```output: 109",
        " LHS we get \\begin{aligned} 18x&=162\\\\ x&=\\dfrac {162}{18}\\\\ &=9\\end{aligned} But we want to find Allen's age 10 years from now. His current age is $11x$ which is equal to $11*9=99$. We just need to add 10 to $99$, so $$99+10=109$$ Thus, Allen's age is $109$.",
        " if I substitute $x=9$ into our previous definition of Allen's age I get $$\\boxed{11(9)=99}$$ which is Allen's current age, but we wanted Allen's age ten years later so add 10 we get $$\\boxed{99+10=109}.$$",
        " $63$. To find out how oldallen will be in 10 years, we just add 10 to his current age which would give us $63 + 10 = 73$ as the answer. Let's run the code to confirm our result.",
        " we get,\\[r=\\frac{b}{a}\\Rightarrow b=a r\\] so the first equation becomes\\[(a+b) r+a=x\\]. hence getting rid of the common factor,a,b we get\\[a r^{2}+a=x.\\]so substituting in the question\\[162\\times \\left(\\frac{11}{18}\\right)=x\\]. thus calculating we obtain the result \\[109.\\]",
