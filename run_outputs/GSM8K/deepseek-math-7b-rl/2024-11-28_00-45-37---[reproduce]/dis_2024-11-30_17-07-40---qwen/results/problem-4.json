The answer is: It seems like you've made an error in your calculation. Let's rethink it: Wendi fed 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, totaling 40 cups. Since there are 20 chickens, each chicken would consume 40 / 20 = 2 cups per day. She has already used the 40 cups, so no more is needed. Therefore, the correct answer is: 0 cups.",

Since this isn\u2019t a continuous process, but rather three meals worth, then to figure out what Wendi\u2019s final meal needs to equal, multiply the 3 times (the amount of meals per day) and get 30 cups, because it takes her 10 meals to feed each chicken. Now, subtract the 40 cups that Wendi already used so far, so you have 20 \u2013 40 which leaves us with -20 and since we can\u2019t have negatives, we\u2019re really just looking at 10 meals\u2019 worth of chicken, meaning 30 meals worth of feed. Since she has only gotten past 10 meals worth of feed yet (which amounts to 170 cups), it means there needs to be another 130 cups of food so that when the 30th meal is finished that means all the chickens will be fed completely. This totals 140 cups. To figure out how much Wendi actually feeds the chickens with as she starts preparing each day, simply divide the 140 cups among the three meals that she has. Thus, divide 140 / 3 to see that Wendi\u2019s final meal of the day will require 47 cups of feed.

There are fifteen cups eaten during the first meal, so subtracting that leaves us with 5 cups remaining to be distributed among the twelve chickens (twenty chickens total minus four chickens who ate feed earlier) This results in five sixteenths or approximately three and a half (one more than half) cups per chicken for the second meal. Now we must account for the fact that only eleven chickens remain to receive feed during the third meal. Therefore, you have two eighteenths or approximately one eighth of the initial five-sixteenths of the remaining feed left over (approximately sixty and seven-twelfths cups). All told, this gives you thirty one and five-eighths (15/8 multiplied by 11 plus three sixteenths) cups needed during the last meal. However, since the original problem statement states that 30 cups are given to the entire flock once in the morning and then again in the afternoon, the question asks only for what remains as a function of the three-meal structure rather than any leftover feed not utilized within it; therefore our solution above yields the final cup amount for an additional meal within the same context or scope as presented in the original scenario.",
