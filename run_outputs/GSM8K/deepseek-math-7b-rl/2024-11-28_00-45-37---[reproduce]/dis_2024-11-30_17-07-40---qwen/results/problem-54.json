Since Patchy has thrice the number of kittens, that means Patchy has 3 times the number that Traxie (that means Traxie has to have less than that for it to work). Let's assume Traxie has T kittens. That means Patchy has 3T kittens. Given that Patchy has 3T kittens and the overall situation is like that so we have Traxie (12) plus Patchy (3T) equals the total number of adopted kittens. As such, 12 + 3T = 7 or 3T = 7 - 12 which is impossible since you cannot make 3T out of -5! Therefore, our initial assumption was wrong. Traxie does not have any kittens, but instead has fewer than that so we need to subtract those 7 adopted kittens from Traxie's total before trying again: let\u2019s consider Traxie having one kitten, then all is correct because T=1. So, in order to get how many kittens the family now has, what would we do? We sum up Patchy's kittens (3T kittens), Traxie's kittens, the number of adopted kittens, and multiply the result by the total number of children (in this case, 2), resulting in how many kittens each cat has.
