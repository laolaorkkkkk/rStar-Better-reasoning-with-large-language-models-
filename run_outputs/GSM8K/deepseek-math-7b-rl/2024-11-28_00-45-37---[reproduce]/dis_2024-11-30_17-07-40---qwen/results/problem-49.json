One whole divided by four equals . To get the decimal value, divide the numerator by the denominator (which means doing long division) but since this is all division by 4, you can skip to dividing only 0 by 4 and move up through every number in the hundred place. Every time you go down the column, put a zero and keep moving until you solve your problem (the solution is 0). Once you've solved the problem for all the columns, the result will be . Since the question asked us for the decimal solution, this will tell us exactly what percent of the building is not being used as 1 = 100%, which is all we need. 5/4ths or five-fourths (all the way above the decimal point) of the entire building is empty.

        " know $3/4$ of them are occupied. So let us calculate $1/4$ because it would be easier: 1/4 of 120=30. Therefore, 3/4 of the building would contain $30 \\times 3 = 90$ occupied units. Finally, let us subtract 90 (number of occupied units) from the original 120 (total units), to find out the unoccupied units: 120-90=30 So Richard owns three dozen unoccupied units: $\\boxed{30}$",

Next, we calculate the number of occupied units by taking three quarters of the total number of units (3/4). This results in 90 occupied units. Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units, which gives us 30 unoccupied units.",

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is \\(\\left(8 \\times 15\\right) \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\). Finally, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units.",

Next, we calculate the fraction of the building being used and convert it into a decimal (3/4 = .75). Then we multiply the amount of occupied units times the decimal (120*.75=90 occupied units). The difference between the amount of occupied units and the total number of buildings is three tenths. If we multiply 15*3/10 or 30/10, we get 30 unoccupied units.",
