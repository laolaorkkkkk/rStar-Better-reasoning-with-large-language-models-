With the diet change, Gerald improved his speed by 10%, but the problem didn't tell us by what percentage Lee improved his speed when Gerald improved his speed (maybe not related?). Therefore, we need another piece of information.

        " helps us determine the 10 percent of the difference (2) so now we can multiply it by 10% to determine what was the original time for running the 400 meters which is going to help us determine what is Y now. We also already know that the difference is a result of increasing by 10%, which means we first solve for what is being increased by multiplying our previous time by 10% (or .1X) then adding it onto our original time, thus becoming the actual time that the competitor ran. Therefore the equation becomes: 1.1Y = Y+.1Y therefore solving for Y gives us that Y = T/1.1 where T represents all the competitors time which we initially calculated as 40 seconds for Gerald before the improvement occurred in his diet so our formulae for Y now is y=.4T/.1 and when doing some algebraic math we get Y=.4(40)=16 seconds since T, which represents the time for Gerald's run before the improvement is 40 sec and the ratio of .4 represents a change of 10% to what he was previously running (which is why it is being multiplied by T to reflect the time he took for running the race 38 times during 2 seconds) we divide this .4 into T which represent Y since .4(T)/.1=T/Y so we can then set up the proportion. We use cross multiplication to get T=4X.1Y which means since Y equals the initial time of 40 seconds and T equals the original time of 40 seconds plus the decrease, T= 38 then 4X.1(38) since X represents the 10% of difference (in this case 2). That means we have found that the value of X is 3.8 sec when we perform our calculation. However; upon further investigation we see that the question asks what is the rate at which Gerald improved his time for running the race during the second half the race vs the first half (hence, half of Y) instead of simply finding the entire rate of improvement over the full length of the 400 meter race (half of T in this problem) Therefore we only halve Y and not T therefore Y/2=.4X.1(Y/2)=(.4X.1)(Y/2), which yields a result of 1.9 seconds as Gerald's improved half time therefore",

Therefore our equation for A is: X/2+1/2Y = X And if you simplify this we get: X=2/3 Y Plug Y into A: A = 2/3 Y / 2 + 1/2 Y A = 5/6 Y So basically we have the relationship between the new and old times as well as their relations to one another so we just plug in the new time for the new distance into equation A. X = Lee's new time X=38 (given in problem), So we solve equation A: 38 = 5/6 Y 38* 6/5 = y 45.6=y (time in seconds) 13.2=y/10 --> ",
        " seconds faster then Gerald (which we're told is exactly half of X) but Gerald's diet improved him by ten percent, then our equation (Y being Lee's time), we need 90% of X which is .9 times X and subtracting this from the amount you get when you double X will get you back to Lee's time so it looks like this: \\begin{align}X &= \\frac{1}{2}(X+X)\\ 2X&=X+(.9X)\\end{align}\\begin{align}Y &=(.9X)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(X+X)\\right)\\ &=(.9X)-X\\end{align}Then substituting (or plugging into) equation B for X makes sense in my example. If we plug in (Y=.3x+T), as I believe T represents Lee's time in terms of X, as I haven't actually solved for T yet we'll stick with that but we'll do the math later, since Y isn't given in the problem (and I don't want you guys to memorize it, trust me...). From here the next step is to solve for T which is just algebraically very simple: $$Y=.3X=T$$And this becomes important for the actual question. Because you said, we aren't looking for any exact values here for instance for the sake of making it look like something easier we know X is 38 for Lee. When you set up equation A by saying that Lee runs the 400 meters in 38 seconds, this means your value for X is simply 38. So then you've already plugged your specific value in the equation above (from there you'd have to calculate T but that's not necessary since we are only interested in the difference in both situations which can be figured out with the simplified version of the full problem.) Plugging our Y and the new rate of 4/9*X to get T yields: \\begin{align}T &=(.3)(38)\\\\ &- Y\\end{align}\\begin{align}Y &=(.3)(4)\\\\ &= 1.2\\end{align}, and thus the difference between Y and T gives us the final answer (if that's the actual solution intended): $\\boxed{2}.5$",

Since their race was a multiple of 400 meters we know that they are all running at an equal rate. That means that they are both running at exactly one point during every lap. So now we want to figure out what part of their race equals to 1 second. To do this divide their races into a whole series of laps where one lap has 400 meters. Let's just say there are N number of these laps so that's why I put the variable first. Let m be the number of laps that Lee completes before he finishes the course. Let's just make sure that these number matches up because otherwise our time is meaningless. So we need mN=l since N represents total laps and m represents only how many Lee completed. So let's see how long Lee takes per lap then: (m*N) / N=m So now we use lees race times. His total distance for all laps is 400N therefore his average time to complete a single lap is (400N)/M=(400/m)*N=since the ratio of N/M always gives you the speed of Lee per lap in seconds and then he multiplies it by his total laps completed he gets lees time which is 38. So the equation becomes : ((400/m)*N)=38. Now the main question asked how long Gerald can run 400 meters in with improvement of 10% in his speed. So first remember that his original time was 36 seconds and that this time allows him to maintain a constant pace across entire distances. Now all we need to do is increase his speed by 10% or 400x0.1 (remembering that his original speed was measured in time, not rate). We get the new equation as follows: ((400/x)*N)+400*0.1*400=M((400/x)*N)+(160)=(M)(400/N+x) Let s substitute variables we found earlier for M = 400 (we are looking for Geralds time and since Galyrs speed matched Lee at 400 m per lap m=400) L=N (there is 1 lap in every milleton race) and",
