Thus the number of days the second time the feeding would start and continue will be the total months (12 months) minus the month (which we assumed the feeding took place initially); that is 12-1=11 months which means every day the amount of food that needs to be maintained is 180+90 = 270 cups which means that the number of days the dog can eat 270 cups daily of food before the next change of its diet would be 11\u00f71=11 years where the total number of days of dog\u2019s life is considered 11 years; let me tell you here that this is the maximum amount the dog can consume without increasing its weight unnecessarily, so any quantity lower than this amount is too low a quantity to consider.

Because the first year has 185 days and we already know for the first part there was 180 worth of food consumed, 5 of the remaining days would have been used for food consumption as well. Therefore the total number of cups needed over the entire year is calculated by setting the simplified above expression equal to zero: 2d \u2013 180 = 0 Solving for d yields that it takes two days for three bags worth of food to be consumed. The solution for d is therefore 60 days. However, that doesn't apply to our original question which asked specifically for the first year so we can see that in the beginning the puppy lived only six months so that means only half of the food was actually going to get burned by us.
