We\u2019re trying to determine the speed which will allow us to cover these remaining six miles within one hour, but if she covers them in less than that it will result in faster than an average speed of four miles per hour during her hike. Using our knowledge about rates, we can set up an equation to represent how fast she\u2019ll need to go during these final six miles:$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} &= \\text{Average rate}\\\\\\\\ \\\\ \\frac{6\\text{ miles}}{x\\text{ hours}} &\\approx 4\\text{ mph} \\\\\\\\ \\end{aligned}$where$x$is the time needed to finish her hike. We know she must finish in exactly one hour because,$$y=\\frac{x+3}{x+5}\\hspace{1mm},\\hspace{2mm}y=4\\hspace{1mm}and\\hspace{2mm}x\\gt -5$$ $$y=\\frac{x+3}{x+5}\\Rightarrow x(y+5)=y+3$$ $$xy-5y=-2$$ $$x=\\frac{-2}{y}-5$$ $$y=4\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{-2}{4}-5=-\\frac{11}{2}<x$$ $$\\begin{cases}y=\\frac{x+3}{x+5}\\\\x(y+5)=y+3\\\\y\\geq4\\\\x\\gt-5\\end{cases}$$ $$\\Rightarrow y=\\frac{2}{x}+4$$ $$x(y+5)=y+3\\Rightarrow x(\\frac{2}{x}+4+5)=\\frac{2}{x}+4+3$$ $$6x=\\frac{5}{x}+4\\Rightarrow 6x^2-4x-5=0\\Rightarrow (2x-1)(3x+5)=0\\Rightarrow x=-5,-\\frac{5}{3}$$ $$x>-\\frac{5}{3},x=-\\frac{5}{3}\\notin(x,y)\\biggr|\\\\ y=\\frac{x+3}{x+5}=...?$$",
        " this value to equal 4 miles per hour. Thus $$4=\\frac{6+r\\times 6}{t}.$$ Solving the denominator for $t$, we have $t=\\frac{6+r\\times 6}{4}$. Finally, we find the ratio of distance traveled and time taken, which represents speed: $r=\\frac{distance}{time}=\\frac{6}{t}$ $r=\\frac{6}{(6+r\\times 6)/4}$ $r=\\frac{6\\times 4}{6+(r\\times 6)}$ $r=\\frac{24}{6+6r}$ $r(6+6r)=24$ $r^2+r-4=0$ $(r-1)(r+4)=0$ $r=1,\\ r=-4$ As you can see, we have no imaginary roots here. However, the only possible value is $r=1,$ as a negative speed makes no sense. The speed must thus be $1$ mile per hour, or $4$ miles per hour if we want it to match the target average. In conclusion, to attain this target average speed and not go above said speed, Marissa must continue hiking at a rate of $\\boxed{4}$ miles per hour.",

To achieve this average speed, Marissa needs to walk at least 4 miles in each hour spent hiking. However, since she already has spent two hours hiking 6 miles, she only has one hour left, meaning she cannot cover any additional distance at her current pace and should aim to slow down or change her direction instead of increasing her speed for the last part of the hike.",

Therefore, she can only spend 1 more hour on the trail. If you divide the 6 miles by 1 hour, your resulting speed equals 6.
