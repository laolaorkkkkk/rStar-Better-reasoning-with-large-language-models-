From here we know that 4+4=8 student slots have already been accounted for, which leaves $16-4 = 12$ students taking up the remainder or 'hip hop' slot. To find the percent, divide the number signing up for hip-hop over the original total of students and multiply by 100. Therefore $\\frac {12}{20}\\times100 = 60\\%$. Hence 60 % of all students enrolled in the Hip Hop category. Thus, exactly sixty percent of all the students signed up for modern style dancing! Our last calculation was $\\frac {RH}{T} \\times 100$, so just letting our readers know that when you see something like \"x%\" in a problem, it can be rewritten as \"$x/100$\". With this understanding, it makes sense that what we computed was indeed a percent figure. Alternatively, the distinction may be made implicitly through units. In the numerator of a fraction, \"RH\" might indicate \"right handed\" while in the denominator \"T\" stood for \"total\", implying a percentage or probability. A common misunderstanding regarding the above method is that many people drop the % sign when performing calculations involving %. While this omission may save you a couple keystrokes, your answer should explicitly display the % sign whenever you are answering a question that specifically asks for a percentage (or proportion). Some instructors even make a point of subtracting points if the symbol is missing. Just a thought... As long as you get the right answer, no one other than your instructor will care about your method. It doesn't matter whether you write 60%, 0.60, or$\\frac{3}{5}$--they all represent the same quantity in the end. One important note: word problems can contain tricks or additional steps that serve to obscure the central mathematical point. Be sure to take a moment to carefully consider what the problem is asking first and to assess the most efficient solution strategy before attacking the problem. Further, always take advantage of the opportunity to double check your work. Use a different method to solve for the same result",

        " into Contemporary Dance Class out of twenty available ones meaning we still have leftover members which equaled 20\u22124=16 individuals waiting further fate designation so to speak... Next portion states .25 or one quarter (.25)*(16)=4 enrollments took place among those seeking Jazz Dance Club selections leaving the balance of interest party crankship candidates subjectively inclined towards Hustle Hop Hip Hop Movement.... To find our missing value, take our current total of remaining enthusiasts after Contemporary and Jazz Clubs established their ground rules/ agendas first as shown above --which was determined to sixteen people--and multiply it by the forthcoming percent converting from a decimal figure obtained when expressed as such.. thereforely,.2*16 yields us what remains within this club... drum roll please.... N = 3! :D",
        " 4 = 16 students because we subtract this figure out of our original student count before finding their enrollment percentages later steps below involving calculation based upon what fraction or percent remains etc...Now if 25% went into jazz dancing instead--we calculate(25/100)*($$$)=n\"where n represents those taking Jazz Dance\", so therefore(.25)(remaining ",
        " of those remaining equaled their enrollment numbers as seen below; We can conclude therefore that these figures also represent percentages based off the original group size(of twenty). With this information we learn that .25*16= <<25*16/100=4>>4 student s signed up for Jazz Dance., so only ten represented Hip Hop dancers because it was obvious when you counted them all manually! That leaves us knowing our last value accordingly.. Outcomes wise too right?. Okay great!. To find out what percent Of those leftover individuals made up most or least part amongst others could simply go back here once again : (. And calculate thus ((number /original starting point)*100))==>(left over students/(total beginning amount))\u2217100=(12)(20)\u2217100=60%. Or just visually if your teacher allows it use simple ratio reasoning... It took me about three minutes myself finding ways upon how best i could demonstrate my thinking which hopefully isn\u2019t too confusing !",
        ". This leaves us with $20 - 4 = 16$. Next we find how many students enrolede d in jazdance among these remaining students who didn't take contemporary. A quarter (or 25%)of those not taking contemporary goes intojazz so $.25 \\times 16 = 4$, leaving us with $16 - 4= 12$ or twelve people signed up fora combination of both styles . We know therefore ,that sixteen percent ($=\\frac{12}{20}\\times {100}$)enrolled int high-pop since no one else was eligible! $\\text{%}$.So our value falls within our acceptable range for percentages ($\\le 100$). Thus:.This tells us correctly what fraction/percentages belonged to which group(s).",
        " or jazz dance yet. Next find what proportion these remainders enroll into jazz dance; since 25% (or $\\frac{1}{4}$) take up jazz dance we multiply the remainder ($16$) so as to not confuse it with those enrolling only in one form of dance $$16\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 4.$$ This shows four people elected to go towards jazz dancing among them meaning all other forms aside would need further computation such as finding their respective values through subtraction once again until reaching our desired value which here lies within either contemp/jazz OR just partaking solely in certain aspects of hip hop thus resulting $$\\text{%of }_\\text{Total} = (\\boxed{(16-4)/20})*100\\%=60\\%$$. Thus approximately around  60 percent took place under classification involving both classical ballet & modern styles while also applying traditional elements characteristic specifically pertaining Hip Hop Dance genre itself leaving us therefore concluding that",
        "=4$ students enroleded in jazz dance. That leaves us with $(16 - 4)= 12$ students still not enlisted which implies all those students enrolled in Hip Hop Dance! To find what percentajeenof the group thats students represent we divide the amount (which represents the part) over the whole (the original grouped entity before taking percents), so $\\frac{12}{20} \\cdot 100\\% = 60\\%$. Therefore $% of the population enrolled in hip hop\". Thus our last answer is :$\\boxed{60}$.",
        " either contemporary or jazz dance classes. That leaves us knowing which $\\text{students} = (20) - (\\text{contemporary or jazz}) = 20 - 8 = 12$have enrolled in hip-hop dances. To find our desired percentage, divide the number of those in the hip hop group by the total number of students and multiply it all by one hundred. Or as an equation: $$\\frac{\\text{hip hop students}}{\\text{total students}} \\times 100 = \\frac{12}{20}\\times 100.$$Simplify that expression to get your percent: $$=\\frac{6}{10} \\cdot 100$$And another way to say \"$6/10\\cdot 100$\" is \"$600/10$\" which simplifies to just \"60%. Therefore, 60% of the student body enrolled in Hip Hop Dance.\""
