Let me rework things while sticking within the framework of pure fraction calculations ... starting once again with those ten liters of Orange Juice possessing a water content proportion of $\\frac{2}{3}.$ We can determine what fractional portion of the entire mixture is water-- simply by multiplying the fraction representing the amount of water in each individual litchi juice by the proportion of that juice in the overall mixture.

Recall that percentage can mean portion per one-hundred. A simpler approach may be conversion of percentages first before doing calculations. Two-thirds equals roughly .67 while three-fifths converts to .6, making further math easy. Multiply these sums along with their respective quantities, sum those values and subtract off spillage ($1$). $$ \\text {water in mixed drink} = (10)(\\text {water in } 2/3) + (15)(\\text {water in } 3/5)-1.$$ We used this formula above but didn't show all the steps. We calculate $$\\text {water in } 2/3 = \\frac{2}{3}= .67$$and$$\\text {water in } 3/5 = \\frac{3}{5}= .6 .$$So continuing with our calculation (replacing the variables in the abstract formula above), $$ \\text {water in mixed drink} =(10)(\\text {water in } 2/3) +(15)(\\text {water in } 3/5)-1,$$or $$=(10)(.67)+(15)(.6)-1,$$which simplifies to $$=6.7+9-1=14.7.$$Because precision is important in my opinion when dealing with words such as exactly, we decide not round until the very last digits which usually happens to be finding percent value(in this case). Therefore $.67+.6=.13$, thus yielding us having approximately seventeen point seven ouncesof pure drinking liquid out of twenty four overall.(Don't forget subtraction off spillage!).

This means what remains in the mix(afterspillage) holds $$24-\\frac{44}{3}=\\frac{72-44}{3}=\\frac{28}{3}.$$ Therefore What % WATER ? Well firstly, let us calculate how many LITRES OF WATER those represent compared to our new mixture of twenty four Litres$${\\frac{28}{3}}\\div24\\times100\\%=\\dfrac{2800}{72}\\%=\\dfrac{700}{18}\\%=\\approx 38.\\overline{88}\\%.$$.

Your calculation is correct within reasonable margins and error and also exceeds the acceptable range of answers. HOWEVER, please note that according to the rules provided to me by Dr. Loo - author of The Problem Solver's Edge , since the question asks specifically FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF WATER.... We need to take into account all the water... Obviously 38.(repeating), even though greater than 37.5%, actually represents less percentage wise of what the total mixture becomes... Meaning, that although it's technically true, we cannot simply accept that value as the ONLY Water component without accountingfor the liquid contents too!!

We know just how much water was initially present in both juices prior to accidental spilling of one liter worth of OJ Let's see if our earlier calculation based upon that information may still be carried through ... Original Amount Of Water In \u201cSpilled Orange\u201d Was $\\dfrac{2}{3} \\times 10\\text{ L} = \\dfrac{20}{3}\\text{ L}$; original contents in the other kind of drink was readily calculated as $= 9\\text{ L}$, hence Total water originally:=$\\dfrac{20}{3}\\text{ L}+ 9\\text { L} = \\dfrac{20+27}{3}\\text{ L}=\\dfrac{47}{3}\\text{ L}.$ Our spilled liter takes away water equivalent to taking away just 1/24th of this total quantity therefore:- Net Amount Poured Out Is Just What You Measuerd,$$\\dfrac{47}{3}-\\dfrac{1}{24}\\times \\dfrac{47}{3}=\\dfrac{47}{3}-\\dfrac{47}{72}=\\dfrac{(1488-47)}{72}=\\dfrac{1441}{72},$$Therefore Percentage Of Water By Weight In the 24 litre mixture resulting from the combination process=$$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{1441}{72}}{\\text{24}}\\times 100\\% = \\dfrac{1441}{1728}\\times 100\\% \\approx 83.3\\%$.
