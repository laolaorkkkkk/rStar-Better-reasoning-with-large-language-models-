        " leftovers Rearranged algebraically it looks like: Purchased Items = Usage + Leftovers - Initial Stock Substituting values into the formula above: P = (Usage &plusLeftovers)-InitialStock or simplyP=((&minus",
        " upon the absolute quantities of Post-Its (80+P-23), let us write the equation in terms of the actions which Candice took: she started with 80 Post-Its and bought others, then wrote down 220 using those Post-Its, and finally had 23 leftover. Thus, if we start with zero Post-Its, we can add 80 to Candice starting point, then add (say) $x$ for each of the twenty-two bundles of fives that Candice bought (since each bundle contains 5), we obtain her ending tally of Post-Its. Applying this approach yields the equation $$0+80+5x+23,$$where like before, `5x' models the fact that every purchase consists of a package of five bundled together. Putting the numbers in this case gives instead $$0+80+5(P)+23 = 220$$which simplifies first to $$80 + 5P + 23 = 220\\implies 103 + 5P = 220,$$and ultimately to $5P = 220 - 103$, or $$5P=117.$$Thus solving for $P$ tells us that indeed Candice made one purchases ($P=23$). As usual, our sense-making about the problem should always come last. Doing so here reveals no error: Candice initially had eighties worth of Post Its, wound up with twenty-threes, having written down two hundreds well accounted for by the other three values makes sense as accounting. To confirm, take particular comfort in the possibility of a self-consistency check : since each package contains fifty labels, twelve packages yield sixty, meaning Candice could have a closing inventory of $\\boxed{sixty}$ Labels (having started with eighty and purchased twelve packages). Fifteen fewer than two hundred would certainly leave precisely twenty-three labels once you subtracted them from two hundreds . QED",
        " to find $x$, which is the number of additional (new) packages of Post-It notes Candice bought, since each package contains 100, therefore the total number of additional Post-It notes is $100x$. Set Up the Equation: Thus you should have: $B + 100x = \\text{cups} + L$. This gives you: $80 + 100x = 220 + 23$, or equivalently: $80 + 100x = 243.$ Finally Solve the Equation: Using the techniques you know, you can easily deduce from this last equation that: $100x=243-80\\Rightarrow 100x = 163$, so divide both sides by 100 to get: $x=\\frac{163}{100}$, obviously this doesn't make sense--since you can't buy a fraction of a package!. Looking back, remember that I said the equation needs to be set up carefully. Here goes my fixed work: Candice began with some Post-It notes, let's call those NI (for \"No. of Initials\" i.e. what she started with), she uses some at the job, and she also bought some more with her own money. If Np is the number of post its she bought, then eventually Candice would have had NI+Np\u2212Used = 23. From the problem, we know CUED = 220 (i.e., Used). Also Candice always starts with 80, so NI = 80 . Therefore we have NI + Np \u2212 Used = Leftover. Substituting the known values we have: 80 + Np \u2013 220 = 23 => Np = 220 \u2013 23 + 80 = 277 Subtracting the initial amount suggests strongly that something has gone wrong, especially since one would not expect a negative value. To rectify this, reread the problem and realize that I carelessly set CUED(used) = 220 while in reality it should be initialized or CIED because she puts one on each cup. Re-doing the problem with this realization, we get : Candice begins with 80, buys Np more, uses 220 (she puts one",
        " and solve for clarity. Begin by simplifying the left hand side: $$P - 140 = 23.$$ To isolate $P$, add 140 to both sides: $$P - 140 + 140 = 23 + 140,$$ so $$P = 163.$$. However upon reviewing the problem once more, we realize that $P\\neq163$; rather,that quantity represented the cost (in cents)ofa dozen eggs. As such,the discrepancy providesthe key insight. By setting up an ADDITIONproblemwhen the language of the problem dictated a SUBTRACTIONneeded to be made, our misconception allowed us to stumble upon the correct solution. Going back to the original equation,$B + P - \\text{cups} = L$,and substituting in the known variables (this time keeping in line with the language of the problem), we obtain : $$B + (\\text{packs}) - \\text{cups} = L.$$ Looking carefully at this new representation, we see that $(\\text{packs})$is indeed the unknown variable we need solve for. Noticing the term packs leaves no ambiguity as to what the equation states: the number of post-its Candicebeganwithadded tothenumber provided by the packs of post-itsshe acquiredon her way(whichever is greater) ,minus those used by her on cups,equals the final numberleftover.So,nowsubstituting the known values into the equation results in:\\begin{align*}80+(\\text{packs})-220&=23\\\\\\Rightarrow(\\text{packs})&=220-80+23\\\\\\Rightarrow(\\text{packs})&=163.\\end{align*}. Hmmm, something doesn't seem right here either. Notice that solving the resulting linear expression above yields the number ofpost-itis in the PACKS Candice bought, not the number of individual packets. As previously stated,each packetcontains 100 post-its . Therefore,if Candice bought 163 packsof post its,then this actually equated to buying $$163(100) = 16,\\!300$$ post-itswhich is far too many than the 163 candice only bought individually.. Resetting our approach,candiceneveractuallybought163individualpost-its\u2013rather,thoses163camefromasing",
        " up incorrectly adjusted to account for the ending inventory. The intended equation was $$B + \\text{purchased} - \\text{cups} = L.$$ Performing this substitution, the new equation becomes $$80 + P - 220 = 23,$$ or simplifying $$P - 140 = 23,$$ and adding 140 to both sides results in $$P = 163.$$ Clearly, something isn't right here. Note that if 163 individual post-it notes were purchased, in addition to the initial stock of 80, that would mean a grand total of 243 altogether. When you subtract the number of post-it notes used (220 for the cups), you get 23, which indicates the final inventory--but that contradicts the fact that Candice had 23 lefover. Consequently, an adjustment needs to made to how the problem was approached initially. While it is tempting simply to \"add\" the unknown variable term to the equation so as to maintain the balance (as in $80 + P - 220 = 23$), ultimately this creates an inequality, namely $P + 80 - 220 > 23,$ which implies $P - 140 > 23.$ Adding 140o to both sides immediately destroys the purported equivalence of the two sides of the inequality sign (that is, the right hand $23 + 140$ cannot be equivalent to the left side variable $P$). Eliminating this problem requires an understanding that when the box of additional post-its was introduced, its contents needed to be added on to the 80 Candice already had--in other words, the true equation to solve should be written $$(\\text{starting inventory}) + (\\text{purchases}) - (\\text{cups}) = (\\text{ending inventory}).$$ Using the known values yields $80 + P - 220 = 23$. Following the appropriate algebra, the corrected solution path leads to $P + 80 - 220 = 23,$ or $P - 140 = 23.$ Adding 140 to both sides simplifies the equation further to $P = 163;$ just as before, while mathematically sound, this solution doesn't make any sense in terms of the context of the real world problem since no such packaging exists",
        " be right, because our problem stated clearly that only one package was purchased... what went wrong here? Let\u2019s take another look at those steps above ... yup, definitely something fishy going down at step 3! Instead of adding $(80-23)$ to $P$, why not combine like terms first, so we actually go directly to $80+P-23=220$. Moving the numbers around to one side and the variables to the other gives us immediately :$$80-23+P=220\\Rightarrow 57+P=220,$$ which brings us to $P=220-57=163.$ Ack!! Aha! Of course! Yes, my friend, you\u2019re absolutely correct. I foolishly confused combining like terms with addition of like terms (which is multiplication)\u2014that\u2019s just silly! Duly corrected, our calculation becomes instead: $$80+P-23=220\\Rightarrow 57+P=220,\\quad\\text{and then}\\qquad P=220-57=\\boxed{163}.$$ However, dear reader, please note that the actual error in the solution above isn't in the math itself, but rather in confusing disjointed thinking regarding combination/addition versus simplification of equations through subtraction or adding opposite quantities across an equals sign.... oh well, that kind of thing happens to even the best of us! Back to the task at hand . It turns out that solving via the original path would have worked fine too if carefully executed--the mistake noted above was simply a bit of fun mathematical theater to engage with the solver.:$$\\textit{Alternate route to the solution:}$$$$\\hspace{6mm} Starting again with }80+P-23=220,$$$$\\textit{we might first combine like terms},$$$$$$\\textit{then simplify}$$",
        " up based upon the subtraction of what she used on the cups from what she began with or purchased (whichever is larger), from what she actually ended up with. Thus, if W stands for 'what she actually ended up with,' namely those 23 leftovers \\[\\text{ then } B \\, {\\rm or} P - 220 = L\\]\\[? - 220 = 23\\]Again, we substitute $B$ with eighties, remembering to use the proper syntax for the minus sign,$$80+P -220=23$$and combine like terms,$$P - 140=23$$And add fourteen to both sides$$P=23+140=163.$$No wonder that solution didn't make sense. Notice how the variable $P$, representing the unknown number of purchases, appears on only one side of the equation whereas typically unknown quantities appear both sides of the equations. To see why that is so here, imagine that instead of having started with however many Post Its Candice brought into the shop, she had started with none at all and had made sure to put aside enough money at the register to ensure she would wind up with precisely whatever she had found in her purse when she got home. Well, that amount of cash (the equivalent of 23 loose post its) plus the cost of the cups blown on the lattes must then equal the value of what she bought -- otherwise, she wouldn't have wound up exactly where she did. Again we go met to this scenario algebraically letting $P_{\\text{bought}}$ denote the value of what she purcashed(in dollars): start with nothing $$\\text{target}$$add the intended end result amount spent$$\\underline{+ (\\_ + 220)}$$ which equals to what she actually paid i.e., the value of what was purchased$\\Rightarrow\\, + P_{\\text{bought}}.$ Putting this into equation form yields simply $$P_{\\text{bought}}=23+220\\Rightarrow P_{\\text{bought)}=243.$$Well lucky for candace, it turns out our original suspicion backfired because even though candyce probably thought she needed alot of extra packaging ,she actually only snuck home one package ! Ain't math grand .In reality, most people don't keep track of items as rigorusly ascandace did above and consequentlytheyare more likely to confuse themselvesand potentially lose points on tests",
        " P$. Setting the equation up based on the above, we get: $$B + P - \\text{cups} = L.$$ Substituting known values, we get: $$80+P-220=23,$$ which simplifies to$$P-140=23\\Rightarrow P=163.$$. However if carefully read the problem (specifically the last sentence), you would notice that such an absurdly high number doesn't make sense within the context. Going back to our previous equation realization that something isn't working, we realize that we need to reevaluate our equations setup. Looking at our equation once again: $$B + P -\\text{cups}=L.$$ Knowing that Candice begun with 80 items, and ended with having 23 items definitely leaves less than 220 items used throughout the day. Therefore we must revise our approach slightly to account for the subtraction of those two quantities. Lets try instead: $$B + P = \\text{cups}+L.$$ Again substituting in known values: $$80+P=220+23.$$ Solving for P readily gives: $$P=220+23-80=163.$$ As this still seemed strange and incorrect at a cursory glance, I decided to double check my math. Once I fixed the minor algebraic error, I obtained: $$80+P=220+23 \\Rightarrow P=243-80=163.$$ Wait...where did I go wrong?! @adriank pointed out on Twitter that I'd solved for the wrong variable :-/. To see why, consider the following corrected version of the original equation: $$\\text{[what she began with]} + \\text{[how many were purchased that day]} = \\text{[how many were used over the entire day]}.$$ Based on the wording, any equation of the form $B + P = U$ or $P = U - B$ ought to do. And voila!, fast counting shows that indeed solving $80+P=243$ yields $P=163$. Oops! It turns out that thinking too hard about the word problem led me astray :( . Regardless, thanks to everyone who provided a solution! Steps Forward From here, simply calculate how may packs of post-it notes candice purchased by performing the operation $163/100 = 1.63$. Clearly, a",
        " P - 220=23,$$ follow the same algebra steps as above and you'll find yourself solving the perfectly reasonable $$P-140=23\\Rightarrow P=163.$$ Ooops! Once more our arithmetic didn't turn out right. Clearly something went wrong here. Going back to the equation $B + P -\\text{cups} = L,$ we see that something amiss: the term $- \\text{cups}$ ought to be negative, implying that the actual number of post its used was fewer than the number Candice began with plus what she purchased. Go back and check your work: you made an error in your arithmetic, but if you go back through line by line you cannot find it. Something deeper has happened. Notice that whereas initially we wrote down $$(B+P)-C=L,$$ eventually we incorrectly replaced this with $$B + (P-\\text{cups}) = L.$$ To rescue our calculation, notice that subtraction is not associative -- that is, in general $$(a-b)-c \\neq a-(b-c).$$ From this point of view, going from $$(B+P)-\\text{cups}=L$$ to $$B+(P-\\text{cups})=L$$ is incorrect: the former is the correct statement of the problem while the later is not. Fix the algebra: instead, reverse the order of the subtraction on the lefthand side to find $$(B+P)-\\text{cups}=L \\Rightarrow B+P= L+\\text{cups}.$$ Substitute the given values for L, B and cups into the equation to find the value for P: $$\\begin{array}{c c c c c c c} 80 + P &=& 23 + 220 \\\\ 80 + P &=& 243 &\\quad\\implies\\\\ P&=& 243-80 = 163.\\\\ \\end{array}$$ As before we obtain an obviously erroneous result. What went wrong? Reviewing the initial correct equation $$(B+P)-\\text{cups}=L,$$ Candice realized she had misremembered the equation. Suppose she meant to say 'I started with a certain number of post-it's, I added some more, and combined them all and used up so many. The remainder is what I have left.' If so, following the algebraic path developed last, we would write $$B+P-\\text{cups}=L\\Rightarrow B",

        " 100 notes! Instead let us go back and reread the problem closely. When I subtracted twenty three from eighty at the beginning, I probably should have taken that away from just the first eight tens -- carrying over the zero ones instead. Let's try again... Following the same reasoning but fixing the previous mistake, our calculation now becomes $$80+P-2=220$$ (the minus two because only the tens digit gets affected), which simplifies to become $$P +(80-2) =220,$$ leading immediately to the correct value for P : $$P=220-(80-2)=220-78=142.$$ What happened here? Well, unfortunately when dealing with English descriptions of mathematics problems, ambiguity can lurk anywhere. Hopefully this explanation makes sense, if not, please followup with a question!",
        " day (U), let set it up like this: what she began with plus however many new packages she acquired $(B+NP)$ minus the number used $(\\text{used})$ equals the leftovers $(L)$. From this starting place and doing the algebra correctly, we find that indeed just one package was needed: \\[\\begin{split} B+NP-\\text{used}&=L\\\\ 80+P-220&=23.\\end{split}\\] To continue solving for $P$, first add $220$ to both sides to find that \\(P+80-220=23\\implies P-140=23,\\) and finally adds $140$ to both sides to obtain that the one and only package she bought was indeed ten:\\[P=23+140=163.\\] Oops! Again, this clearly cannot be the correct number of packages since each package contains 100 stickies, not 163. With such substantial discrepancy coupled with our units digit not checking out on our solution above, we need to retrace our steps and check our work. Looking back at where our error occurred, we see that our translation of \"the sum of candies initially and additional candy yielded total amount\" incorrectly gave rise to the following equation: \\[C+\\text{additional candy}=\\text{total}.\\] This line of reasoning should have instead yielded: $$\\text{Initial Amount}+\\text{Additional Packages}-\\text{Used Candy}= \\text{Ending Amount}.$$ Applying this correction, our new equation is:$$80+P-220=23,$$ which happily simplifies to become:$$P-140=23,$$from which we readily find that $P=163$. As this still doesn't jive with the fact that each package contains 100 sticks, we go back and look for our error. Going back through the problem, we notice that when translating 'she places one sticker on each of 220 different cups', we wrote this as adding instead of multiplying:220 stickers + other stickers = total stickers. D'oh! Thinking about the original problem, placing one sticker on each of 220 cups of coffee yields 220 stickers, so our equation should have been: Initial stickers + new stickers - stickers used = final stickers $$\\implies 80 + P - 220 = 23 .$$ Following the algebra from",
        " result--you had 23 leftover $\\Rightarrow L = 23.$ Use this information to write an equation based on the fact that what she began with $(B)$ plus what she bought$(P)$ minus her leftovers $(L)$ equals the cups to which she affixed post-its $\\Leftrightarrow B + P - L = \\text{cups}$. Then plug in your known values and solve for what you don't know. Doing so gives you the equation $80 + P - 23 = 220\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad P+57=220 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad P=220-57 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad P=163$. Ooops! This still isn't working. Are you sure you have the right equation? Is it possible you misunderstood the problem? No, the problem is fine. The equation itself is correct. What went wrong? When doing this problem, it's important to pay close attention to what your variables stand for and how you're using them. Specifically, thinking back to the last bit, when you wrote $P + 57 = 220,$ that's not actually what the problem said. What the problem said was (and should be represented by) $80 + P - 23 = 220.$ Notice that the term $- 23$ was outside the parentheses in the original equation, but became $+ 57$ inside your equation! This is a mistake and it led you to an incorrect solution. Going back to the beginning: use the correct equation correctly. Following this advice we start with the correct equation $$B + P - L = \\text{cups},$$ Plug in the known values to get $$80 + P - 23 = 220,$$ Simplify the left-hand side of the equation to obtain $$57 + P = 220,$$ Finally, solve for P by subtracting fifteen from each side to obtain $$P = 220-57$$ And simplify the right hand side to find that $$P =163 .$$ Oh no! Obviously, something went terribly wrong here, because 163 doesn\u2019t make any sense as a variable value for anything in this context. Clearly, I\u2019ve used the incorrect equation. Starting over with the correct equation\u2026 Hooray! This time it worked! Therefore, Candice bought $\\boxed{163}$ additional",
        " same items equaled 220 additional individual useable posts (since one per cup). Therefore our equation becomes$$80+P-23=220.$$Combining like terms,$$80+P-23=220\\qquad\\Rightarrow P+57=220\\qquad \\Rightarrow P=220-57,\\quad P=163$$\\(\\Rightarrow\\)She thus bought $\\boxed{163}$ packets of pre-made sticky notes. And since every packet contains an equivalent number of stickers,$$\\text{{Number of Stickers Per Packet}}\\times\\text{{number of packs}}=163*\\text{{stickers per pack}}.$$To find this unknown value ($\\text{{StickersPerPack}}$)we need another piece of information which relates to either the quantity or quality of any sticker purchases(in other words pairs any value with something that equals 163.). Here, because everything except the sought variable factors into only one term, such an equation can be made if we make the simple observation that whatever the sticker count per pack, the above product still expresses the net change in the overall tally of stickers. Since we know what that number ($220-80+23=163$) equals, It therefore follows that $$163=\\text{{StickersPerPack}} \\times 1\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\text{{StickersPerPack}}=\\frac{163}{1}=163.$$. Thus you had to buy sixteen three bundles of stickity goodness! Or alternately just solve via$$P+57=220\\qquad \\Rightarrow P=220-57=163.\\quad\\Rightarrow 163\\cdot ?=163\\qquad\\Rightarrow ?=1.$$It seems trivial now but its a useful trick to remember when faced with variables in both the additive and multiplicative structures of an equation..",
        " P: $$P=220-57\\implies P=163.$$. And so our missing variable represented the purchase of exactly $\\boxed{163}$ additional packets of those sticky notes!",
        " relation $80+\\text{packagesto buy}-23=220$, let us set this time around $$80+\\text{packagebought}\\times 100-23=220,$$ since each additional pack of post-its consists of 100 sticks. From here, we find $\\text{packages bought}$ by isolating the variable on one side: $$\\text{packagebought}\\times 100=220+23-80\\implies \\text{packages bought}\\times 100=263$$ $$\\implies \\text{packages bought}=\\frac{263}{100}=2.63.$$. However you cannot buy part of a box of sticky notes, so clearly something went wrong. Looking back upon our previous steps, consider the fact that if Candice threw away twenty three stickers, that meant she initially used fewer than 220+23=243 stickersthe maximum possible under the scenario in whichshe used one for each cup and started with noneadditionally . Since she only had 80 initially, it becomes clear what went wrong in the initial setup: we cannot subtract 23 from the right hand side. Rather, we must do the opposite and add this quantity to the other side instead. Thus our new equation is found by noting that $$80+\\text{Package bought} \\times 100=220+23.$$ Following the algebra from here would lead us to the right answer, so no need to retrace those steps. Suffice it to say, simply adding the 23 to the RHS (right hand side) yields our new equation: $$\\text{Package bought}\\times100=220+23-80=263\\implies \\text{Package bought }=\\frac{263}{100}=2.63.$$ As before this cannot be correct as we cannot buy 0.63 of a box of stickies. By this time you've hopefully realized that your very first setup was incorrect -- you must add the 23 to the right side, not subtract it, otherwise you'll throw out valid cases and miss the solution(s). Fixing the equation to correspond with good physical sense, we find ourselves with Equation 2a: $$80+\\text{Packagesto Buy}\\cdot 100=220+23",
        " problem correctly. Starting with 80 notes plus however many made the transition over the threshold (let $x$ denote that quantity) must equal 221 (a use of one per every actual cup of coffee, plus those lingering around afterwards): $$80 + x = 220 + 23,$$ since using $220$ cups and having $23$ left over is the sum which must be accounted for through our left hand side. From here solving is simple: $$80+x = 243\\implies x= 243-80 = 163$$ As you might expect, this yields a ridiculous result relative to the problem posed. Clearly something went wrong in our setup. Going back to the previous version, we see the error: we solved for $P$, thinking that meant the number of packages Candice BOUGHT. But really the unknown represented the number of POST-IT NOTES which magically appeared in midstream! Since clearly such a quantity existed (she did go buy packages of Post Its, didn't she?) this change in tack was necessary to render a correct solution. Thus we turn our attention to revisiting the original problem and changing our approach accordingly going forward into the new year My thinking now goes like this: bundlesbought=(total used)/single post itNote bundle size so b = (220+23)/100 solves to b = approximately 2.43 Given this result we know that Candice most certainly could not have bought exactly 2.43 post it Note bundles. Thus if Candice spent a mere 2 or 3 bucks on additional Post its via purchase, say at a price of $0.50 per item, only integer values of the bundles bought tally hold water. And obviously we need to figure a value that takes her total starting notes, adds the additional purchases, minus the ending inventory and gets to her use of 220+. Solving for n in: $$\\text{(Starting Inventory)} + (\\text{bundles bought}) \\times \\text{(per bundle)} = \\text{(ending inventory)}+\\text{(use)},$$ Or $$ 80 + n*(\\$0.5/\\text{note}) = 23 + 220/1,$$ Is plain sailing from here: $$80 + .5n = 243,$$ Subtract 80: $$0.5n = 163,\\",
        " Candice initially had 80 post-it notes. At work, she used 220 post-it notes. This means that so far (before buying any new ones), she has used up or gone through 80+220=300 post-it notes.

But if you take absolute value of negative one hundred seventeen,\\[\\left|{-117}\\right|=117.\\] Clearly something went wrong because our solution doesn't make sense! We need another approach . Let us rewrite down all information about numbers changes : initial 80 , addition$^{*}$of certain amount which we denote as unknown variable `x`(because we donot know it yet), subtraction (use of) 220 followed by ending with rest 23 ; therefore we express it as : $$initial \\;+\\;addition\\;-\\;usage\\;=\\;ending.$$ Writing it down symbolically/algebraically, we get $$ 80+x-220=23.\\tag{we correctly used \"$=$\" sign here}$$ To solve for unknown x, first add 220 to both sides of equation $$ 80+x-220+220=23+220,$$ $$ 80+x=243.$$. Then subtracting 80 from each side, we get$$ 80+x-80=243-80,$$$$ x=163 .$$ Thus finally ,number of new (purchased)post-its Candice obtained from the store equals 163. Note that the last couple of steps are actually simplifications, and we could skip writing those steps as informal people often do.But we wrote it to emphasize that indeed positive 117 just can\u2019t possiblybe right no matter what calculation you try because the result cannotpossiblyhavemore than the initial amount but clearly exceeds even zero !

Delivering a pizza may involve dividing a pizza into tenths if a customer specifically asks for 1.3 of a pizza. Also financial transactions usually deal with lots of dollars and cents, which are both decimal based. Fractional resourcing is used quite commonly in the military. A special forces soldier might be asked to provide a fraction of his time to an operation. An example could be \"Provide two fifths of your time to this task\". These are all examples of real life situations involving fractions and decimal numbers.

Arithmetic problems sometimes call for the answer to be written as a fraction, and sometimes a decimal is easier to work with. Have a look at these examples Convert the following decimals into fractions Example : Decimal 0.8 is the same as the fraction 8/10. Both 8 and 10 are divisible by 2, so divide both numbers by 2 and get 4/5. So, 0.8 is equivalent to 4 / 5. Practice ",

This subtle yet importantly dramatic difference makes our task much simpler and brighter ; much like a switch being flipped :) so therefore We can conclude that Y=220 without even solving (now see we dint need to use that variable afterall ); And hence Plugging 220 back into our equation gets us :- ",

A minus sign indicates a DEBT. Ok, back on track. Adding this new quantity ($-140$) along with whatever was slipped into your purse via the mysterious package let's solve for P which represents the value of the unknown post-its in that package. Since Candice ended up having only 23 legitimate post-its as indicated by the problem statement, our equation now reads like this: $-140+P=23$. To isolate $P$ we add $140$ to both sides of the equation: $$-140+P+140=23+140,$$$$P=163.$$This obviously doesn\u2019t make any physical sense because who would slip a NEGATIVE number of objects into someone\u2019s hand?!

Where might errors creep in again?... Ah ha! Didn\u2019t we say that once you apply the items to business, you ONLY lose those applied numbers? Well, technically true, but we also said that you began WITH the 80 noted and ended up applying ALL 220 making a net loss of actually only $(-220)+80 = -140$, therefore leaving yourself with exactly ZERO post its save for mysterious package contents!...
