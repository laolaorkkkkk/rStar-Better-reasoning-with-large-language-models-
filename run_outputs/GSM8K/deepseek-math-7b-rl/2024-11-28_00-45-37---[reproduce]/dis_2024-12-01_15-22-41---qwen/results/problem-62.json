Adding these together you get the original gross payout of $1M.

Done! :)Step 2: Caclulate additional or incremental paiment post 20 Yrs With increase of Tenure of service from 20 to 30 yrs Most important thing to notice here is that employee get 5% increment of already agreed basic pay of $50 K ,so incr amount cannot exceed $2.5k per annum !! No of such additional payments possible = 10 Payments Amount paid for these = $.5 k x 10 =$25k ...Done!!:)Step 3 Add the two values above to find Actual total amount received by workerover her tenure of 30 years. Total value = $1 million + $ 25 k = $1,025 kFinally Divide this value by Number of years worked ; average actual pension per annum = $1,025 k / 30 = approx ..~$34(thousand) annually ~ Got the ",
