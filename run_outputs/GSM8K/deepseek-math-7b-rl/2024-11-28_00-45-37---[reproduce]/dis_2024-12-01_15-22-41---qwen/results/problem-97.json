        " sauce corresponds to three tomatoes (because we start with one can worth of tomatoes which contain three whole tomatoes), so the amount of tomatoes used equals to (x/2)*3=3x/2 . Given that this yields 32 ounces of sauce, therefore equaling our expression above such as 3x/2 = 32. Multiplying both sides through by two, get 3x=64; dividing through by three, we finally see that x_=\\frac{64}{3} , but this doesn't make sense because you cannot divide containers! Our work shows us that something went wrong during our calculations. Going back over our steps, it becomes obvious what. When calculating the yield from the cooked tomatoes, we multiplied the number of cans by three before diving by two. But since each operation was dependent upon the result of the other, this means our calculations no longer make sense. Let's go about this again slowly. As stated earlier, every can of sauce comes from a single can of tomatoes processed. Thus the quantity of sauce is always going to be exactly half the amount of raw material. Said another way, whatever quantity of sauce we measure, that same quantity is the half of what came before cooking. This implies that we want to find a number whose half ends up being 32. Letting q represent the unknown number of cans of sauce produced, we set up the equation \\frac{q}{2}=32 ; multiplying both sides by 2 tells us q=64. With each can producing three tomatoes, the number of cans of tomatoes required is then six times larger than the number of cans of sauce -- or 6*64=384 ! Aha! That seems right. Freda initially used three hundred eighty four individual tomatoes to make thirty two ounces of saucy goodness. To verify, we check whether indeed the half of 384 equals 32: Indeed, 384\\div 2=192\u226032, and not only do we calculate incorrectly but our initial setup didn't accurately model the situation either! Looking carefully at the problem statement, we realize we misunderstood the original intent: it said ''They Lose Half Their Volume.\" For example, starting with two cans of tomatoes would leave behind only one can of sauce - NOT half the amount of original tomatoes!.We need to change our fundamental approach if we wish to proceed. Instead, let T denote the number of tomatoes used and recall that each ",

Since each can was 16 ounces, the number of cans she used is equivalent to 64 / 16 = 4 cans of tomatoes. From here, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to get the solution. Multiplying 4 cans by 3 tomatoes/can gives us 12 tomatoes.

But remember, since each can holds three tomatoes, not four....we need to figure out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used.

However, fractions of cans doesn't really make sense. We clearly must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back through our work. Our conversion of 2 cups of tomatoes to ounces seems perfectly reasonable, as 2*8 equals 16. It's the next part that may need adjustment: we assumed that the 16 oz. yielded from cooking came from 4 tomatoes. This assumption could very well be wrong: perhaps Freda didn't completely cook all the tomatoes\u2014some remains shows up in the sauce, skewing our results. To adjust for this possibility, let's change our approach slightly: if each can yields 3 tomatoes, then lets find out how many ounces of tomatoes those 6 cans produced: $$6\\text{ cans} \\times 3\\text{ tomatoes/can} \\times 4\\text{ oz/tomato} = 72\\text{ oz}.$$ That sounds way too big;Freda certainly didn't use 72 oz. worth of tomatoes. Something seems awry with our original approach entirely: the fact that our math gave us an absurd result indicates that we somehow improperly incorporated the \u201closs of half volume\u201d information. Going back to the beginning of our calculations, we can simply note that any time we're dealing with percentages or \u201closs of x% of y\u201d type situations, the best way to keep from shooting yourself in the foot is to work in fractions; don't convert to decimal form (0.5 as a multiplier instead of 50% or \u00bd) until the very end. Proceeding with this advice, let's reapproach the problem: if half the volume of tomatoes goes into the sauce, then the other half must remain as whole, uncooked tomatoes. Since",

Well if one can of tomatoes only ends up being half that, then clearly 2 cans, 2*8=16 oz of tomatoes was what was needed to begin with. Darn! It sure seems like I did this problem correctly, but somewhere in here we must have made a mistake because just using whole numbers of cans certainly makes more sense than 1.5 cans--the mistake lies in misunderstanding what fraction applies to the result versus the original. To clarify let us reconsider the information given A 16 oz can of tomatoes actually only yields 8 oz of usable food when cooked This means any amount of canned tomatoes, CANS*16 oz per can = Original Tomatoes , will yield RESULT =CANS*8 oz of results since only half survives the cooking process. Given that the amount of sauce was 32 oz which corresponds to the cooked version of the tomatoes, RESULT = 32.
