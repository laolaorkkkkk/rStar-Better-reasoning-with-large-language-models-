Although it is impossible to have half an apple without breaking it, this problem serves as an example of a division where the quotient is a fraction. Let us take another scenario: if you have ten candies, and you want to divide them into groups of three. You would do 10 \u00f7 3. But, since three cannot go evenly into ten, you would end up with three groups of three making a total of 9, and having one left over.

        " the 24 remaining oranges (since 1 was bad) are unripe, or .2*24=4.8; However we can not have fractional parts here since our sample size only allows integers so this calculation means four oranges out of twentyfour remain as unripe instead of being fifty percent [(.5)*(theTwentyFour)]=(12). Our new count of fruits then becomes:[total]-[(bad)+(unripe)+(sour)]=[25]-[1+{(24)*0.2}+2]=[25]-[1+4+2]=[25]-7 Which means that the number of apples that are good is 18.[25]-(1+4+2)=18",
