We know that Marie paid a total of $50 , so this means that the pizzas would account for 50-33 =$17 worth of payment. Since every single box of pizza goes for exactly eight pounds fifty cents (or \u00a38.5), going backwards tells us that since seventeen divided into eighty five hundredths yields just two, Marie purchased precisely Two Boxes Of Pizzae During This Trip/Order!So obviously $\\boxed{the number os boxes of pizza marie ordered}$is 2",

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50 divide the total spending on pizza ($17) by the price per box (P$8.50). This tells us the number of boxes purchased which comes as part whole numbers because you can only buy complete boxes!

This leaves us with just figuring Out this unknown item through simple subtraction operation leaving our equation like :Unknown Value=$(50)-(33)=$17 ,which means exactly what was spent on those mystery boxes of pizza..Now sinceeach such Box Was priced @ $(8.5), therefore using basic principle of fractions we can find its quantity too mathematically expressed as Number Of Boxes =(Cost Spent on Pizzas)/(Price Per Box )=[17]/[8.5]= [highlight]2[/highlight].So finally answering the question correctly ,mari oughto have gotten Two(2).Therefore correct numerical solution is $\\boxed{2}$.",
