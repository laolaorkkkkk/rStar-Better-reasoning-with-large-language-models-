        " movies by adding together the cost of one movie ticket ($7) plus one box of popcorn ($7). That comes out as follows: $$7+7=14.$$So every time Peter hits the movies it costs him $\\$14$. To find out how often he can afford to go, we divide whatever amount of money he has ($\\$42$) By the amount he spends per outing ($\\$14$). This tells us: $$\\frac{42}{14}=3.$$That means Peter can afford to hit the cinemas three times during the course of the week and so our answer isB3",
        "$7for popcorn so adding those together means he\u2019s spending $7+$7= $14each timehe goes to the movies. To find outhowmanytimes he cango the movieswithhis budgetof fortydollars would involve dividing his total amount ($42) By what hes goingtoe spend per trip($14). Thats like saying fourtytwo dividedintoseventeens equals three(cause if you divide carefully u get exactlythree)..so thats our right answer whichisthree",
        "$7+$7=$$14each time he goes to the movies.Now if hehas $42and we want to find out how manytimes ''14'' fits into ''42'', or said another way, what is 42 divided by 14. This can be written as $\\frac{42}{14}$ . Performing the division shows that there are 3 times 14 fits into 42.So Peter can go to the movie store 3 times.$$\\frac{42}{14}=3.$$",
        " because it wouldn\u2019t even reach halfway to D (D=\u00a33) so we would need another \u00a3 or greater before reaching E . We also see V as not being close enough to W i..eW\u2212V=0.02 To confirm our rule above let\u2019s tryand work through B : A\u2014B\u2014C\u2014D\u2014E Taking difference between each (i.e. subtraction): \u00d72 \u00f72 \u00d7 2 \u00f7 2 This gives us the pattern we want! working through it: start with A which equals \u00a31 Step 1:\u00d72 therefore \u00a3 1 \u00d7 2 = \u00a3 2 Step 2:\u00a32\u00f72gives \u00a3 1 back Step 3:take new amount (\u00a3 1) \u00d72 gives \u00a3 2 again Step 4:and finally divide this \u00a32 by 2 brings us back to the original starting point of \u00a31 Therefore using this method we know that indeed its statement is true!

To find out how many times we want him going to see the latest Harry Potter film release (we assume all films qualify), you need divide the amount of money he has ($42) by the cost per trip ($14). You get $\\frac{42}{14}=$3 trips over the course of one week. Therefore Peter can take himself three times into cinemas if he strictly sticks within budget allocated",
