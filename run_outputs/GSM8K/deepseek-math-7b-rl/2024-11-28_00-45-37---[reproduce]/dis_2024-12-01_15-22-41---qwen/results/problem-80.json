Take that .6 ounces and divide it by your original 10 oz THEN multiply times 100% ... Remember when dividing decimals its best to move the decimal point 2 places to the right ..

As ...is notpossible because it contradicts Theorem II hence our intialassumption M \u00cf\u0192 N (m od pq ) mus... First lets understand RSA Algorithm.RSA algorithm based its security on the difficulty of factoringlarge numbers.Its main steps are:(1)Select two large primes P and Q.(2)Compute N=P*Q and PHI=(P-1)*(Q-1)(3)Choose integer E such that GCD(E,PHINo)=1(GCD stands for greatest common divisor.) public key KU={N,E} private Key KR{P,Q,D}.Encryption process C=T^ES mod NHashing process H=CEN Decryption Process DT^(H)- EQ Where prime Numbers mean those who can divide only themselvesand unit but Not leaving any remainder e.g 2,3,5.....",
        " Since both of these children took equal shares , we can say They together took (togeather means plus) : Girls :: 2 \u00c3\u2014 4 :=8 We usually solve word problems by making equations. This method too is same . Let remaining wter id represented as X It s mentioned how much stuff was Given : Amount taken my Girls Y Amout Taken by Boys W Here we write equation according to situation :X \u00e2\u20ac\u201c(Y+W)= Remaining Water Solving this question using above said logic becomes easier . As it avoids lots of calculations That too With great accuracy :)",
        " consist of 1/6th of the whole thing. Both these Girls together receives => 2*4 = 8 litres Two girls took eight liter out of twenty four.. And Boy took Six Liter out of twenty Four... Together They took 14 Litre out of 24 hence remaining Will b total \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Taken = (24-14) = 10 Ltr Remaining ==> 10L"
