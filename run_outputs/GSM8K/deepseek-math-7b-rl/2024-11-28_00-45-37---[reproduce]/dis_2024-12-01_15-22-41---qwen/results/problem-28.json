Well if you remember your addition skills (or maybe I just told you because this problem seems easy), when we put them together side by side as numbers next to each other: `20+15`, our result or solution works itself out nicely into something called '`35`'.

Our first stop occurred after 20 miles and ended the leg of the journey traveled right before the second stop happened. We also know that this last part of the journey prior to reaching the finishing point was measured as being 15 miles less than the entire length of the journey overall. So if 'x' represents the actual mileage when the second stop occurred then X-15 would equal the remaining legs final leg untraveled distance. Since all journeys together are equivalent to the whole trip and its individual parts then X+(X-15)=60miles; combining like terms algebraically equals 2*x-15=60; add 15 across to get rid of the negative sign next to 15 so your new equation becomes 2*x=75; divide both sides by 2 to isolate one x while solving for x yields X=37.5 But again THIS MORONIC STOP MILEAGE VALUE just goes against everything common logic tells us about how numbers work in real world applications!

This shows us clearly that you can get to your second stop mileage point either by adding together your initial partial distance already covered plus what happened to occur after that (in other words, 20+45) OR by subtracting the ending leg of the journey from the overall length of the trip(in other words, 60\u221215).

Our original problem only said the overall trip was 60 miles! What happened to those other 5 extra miles?? Well remember when I mentioned earlier that my second stop was actually 15 miles BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIP? That means he didn't cover the ENTIRE 45 mile stretch after his first stop because some of it fell BEFORE his final destination--it only applied to the part AFTER his second stop. And THAT part turned out to be exactly 45 - 15 = 30 miles which seems correct based on his stated numbers. So therefore if you take the initial 20 miles up to his first stop and add to that the just calculated partial distance of 30 miles between his stops...therefore in reality..he ONLY travelled 20 + 30 = 50 miles due east of wherever his starting point was???!! Oh dear....Now what went wrong? Let me reevaluate the situation. Alrighty, back to work then! Ah ha! Gotcha! It turns out I misunderstood the actual question. The question wasn't asking HOW FAR EAST of his start point he got ,but instead asking HOW FAR HE TRAVELED BETWEEN HIS TWO STOPS!.

Substituting our known values into this equation looks like this:  20 + ? +(60-15)=60 We know what everything equals except for symbol question mark.

That simply comes out as follows when calculated... Difference= Final Stop Point minus Beginning Stop Point --> i.e., calculation would turn out like this--> 20 - (60-15)= 20-(60-15) = 20-45=-25 !!! This result however seems incorrect due to its negativity. What went wrong ? Nothing ! Just that we read the problem wrongly .what indeed happened here was ,the person thought the other way round-- thinking the initial stop occured midway say at 20 miles instead of beginning of journey..and considering the later stop at 15 miles before the finish line thus located it at 60-15=45 miles. Thus distance betn two stops became 45-20=25miles. But actually the correct interpretation of the question envisages the reverse of what just happened--mistakenly earlier .In reality the Begining of second leg of journey was considered as 20 miles itself--which is actually the ending of first stop ; whereas the final stop of entire journey stood at 15 miles before end --or rather at 60-15=45 miles.Thus distance travelled during this part of journey correctly becomes 45-20=25miles!!!So the actual mathematical calculation based upon the reading and understanding of the problem correctly is ..as belowDifference=Final Stop Point Minus Initial Stop Point=(60-15)-20==45-20=25 miles !! As evident by now the error arises due to hastily interpreted language leading to miscalculation .One should always ensure to firstly interpret the mathematical elements and relation between them followed by their numerical evaluation!",
