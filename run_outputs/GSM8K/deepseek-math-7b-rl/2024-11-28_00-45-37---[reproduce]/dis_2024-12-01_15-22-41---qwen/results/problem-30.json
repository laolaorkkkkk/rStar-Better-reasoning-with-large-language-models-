Similarly since Allen 'age\"is $\\frac{11}{7} \\times D$, we can denote them thusly; $$D=7y$$and$$ A = 11y.$$We know (from the problem statement)that $D+A = 162$;Substituting our definitions into the equation means $(7)*y + (11)*y = 162$ or simplifying $18 y = 162.$ Solving this gives us immediately that $y= 9;$Hence,$$\\text{{Allen's current age}} = 11*\\cdot 9 = 99 ,$$and $$\\text{Allen's age ten years hence} = 99+10 = 109 .$$That was really intricate! But essentially what allowed us ro solve this question so easily is a method called \"using unknowns\". It refers systematically assigning a variable name to something we want to find out, and then using these names to translate word statements into mathematics. This usually creates equations which we can solve by standard algebraic means like here. Don\u2019t be afraid to introduce variables, especially when you deal with ratios & proportions!",

However adding (+) ten(+10) makes it seem clearer.$$\\implies12(99)+10=1298 \\text{years}.$$This process seems off base simply because I messed up somewhere along these lines but upon revisiting my steps everything looks fine exceptforone glaring error which becomes evident when performing operations pertaining tothis problem--namely the factoring portion...I accidentally used the sum of ratios rather than the value of individual parts within the ratio...o well it happens. Anyway, here's the fix. Using the information provided earlier stating that Darrell's age is sixty three ($\\text{Darrell}=63)$ therefore Allen's age may be obtained via the difference of their combined age and Darrell's current standing. Thus,$$\\text{Allen}=(\\text{Total Age}-\\text{Darrell})$$And just so happened that our previous values worked out nicely$$\\text{Allen}=(162-63)=\\text{ }99.$$To find next year's value of Allen all we have to essentially add 10 (?) to both sides$$(\\text{Allen}+10).$$Thus providing us yet another interesting tidbit $$(\\text{Allen}+10)=(99+10)\\text{, or}$$suggesting that indeed Allen will turn 119 ().

E.g.: We know the ages come in the ratio 7:11. The difference in the ratio is 11-7 = 4... Knowing that this difference equals 162 \u00f7 (7+11) \u00d7 4 = 40.8 (we add the parts of the ratio together and divide into the total, then multiply by the difference in the ratio). This cannot be correct as the decimal implies a fractional part of a year in someone's age so clearly we have made an error along the way. Looking back, we noticed when we established the common denominator of 18, which incidentally was the sum of our original ratio (7+11), we proceeded to cancel by dividing, only to multiply again to isolate x... When multiplying by 18 directly on the right side of the equation we would have eliminated the need to divide by 18 later... Giving us:(18 \u00d7 (162)) / 18 = 162 , leaving our x = 162 . As before this ultimately leaves us needing to add ten to Alans age : 99 + 10=109..... Another nice relevant 'textbook'-type question might read: The present ages of three brothers are in ration 1:2:3. If their total age is 180, determine algebraically the age of the youngest brother 15 years hence. Solution: Let the common ratio be x, such that the ages are x, 2x, and 3x. We are told that x + 2x + 3x = 180, or 6x = 180, from which we may deduce that x = 30. Thus the youngest brother is currently 30 years old and 15 years",

        " if we plug back into our expressions above for Darrel ans Ellen''s ages (respectively) we get that Darrel was $7\\cdot 9 = 63$ years old and that Ellen was $11 \\cdot 9 = 99.$ Therefore ten years hence Alan would turn $99 + 10 = 109 \\text {years}$ .So Allan\u2019s future age will be $\\boxed{109}$.",
        " $63$; while Allan's would equal $11*9 = 99.$ To find out what Alan's age would be ten years from now, you just add ten (+10) to your result; therefore meaning $$\\text {Alan's new age}= 99 + 10 .$$ Performing operations yields $\\text {Alan's new age}$= $109 .$ Hence using python as follows :```python Age_now=[7,11]",
