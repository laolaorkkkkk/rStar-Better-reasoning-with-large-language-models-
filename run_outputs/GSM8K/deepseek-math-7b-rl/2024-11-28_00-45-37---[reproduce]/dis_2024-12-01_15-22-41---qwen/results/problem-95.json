Shifts:(TOTAL FEMALE GRADERS)-Girl Scout Count=120-80=<<120-80=40>>40. This implies That only forty(40)girls are not part of the Girl Scouts. Thus our solution is $\\boxed{40}$.",
        " boys would be\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 200 &= \\frac{400}{5}\\\\ &= 80\\\\ \\end{align*}. This tells us that out of every 5 students, 2 are boys so $200 \\div 5 = 40$, implies there are $40 \\times 2 = 80$ boys. And since if you take away those 80 boys leaves only 120 could belong exclusively to girls $(200-80=120)$, it follows that as a fraction of all 200 students, the proportion belonging to girls would have to be equal to $\\frac{120}{200}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{3}{5}$. We already know than 2 / 3 or approximately .666...of these girls qualify for Girl Scout status. Simply multiply this by however many girls exist, or $120$. That product will tell us just how many girls make up the Girl Scout contingent. It turns out that $.666... \\times 120 = 80$. From here subtract this result from your preconceived idea about what the number of girls might be and there stands revealed the elusive number of girls who aren\u2019t part of the scouting organization. Given this information our equation can be set up like such: Number of Girls Not in the Girl Scouts = Total Girls $-$ Girls in the Girl Scouts or $120 - 80 = 40$. Hence, exactly forty girls are not in theGirl scouts.. Alternatively one may wish to solve this problem using fractions alone without converting to decimals. Knowing that a fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the girls are part of the girl scouts, we simply multiply that quantity by the total number of girls and once again subtract from the total number of girls remaining outside the scouts. Using either method we see that indeed ${120-80}=40$, meaning precisely 40girlsarenotinthegirlscouts.... The exact ratio of boys to girls in a class is often seen in problems related to Algebra, making for good Algebra practice! Letting `B` represent the ",

This yields us that indeed X=80 females ARE scouting. But if only 80 kids are 'scouting', while supposedly one third OF the girls OR ALL THE GIRLS WERE SCOUTING leaves me confused. As per above calculation i ended up w/ 80 being scouting, yet I was supposed to find those who aren't! Okay let's reevaluate but this time looking for non scouters instead. Well if all the girls weren't scouts AND we already found that 80 were scouts then indeed its rather simple. Simply subtract that other known number FROM the total amount of girls and you will get your answer. Our equation therefore looks like this ",

Next up, let us consider what proportion of these 120 girls happens to be part of the Girl Scout troop. It states that half of all girls ($2/3$) belong into this organization. This tells us therefore that $(2/3)(120)$ or equivalently, $2(40)$ equals $80$. Hence ,we can conclude . Finally use 120 - 80 to compute the number of girls who aren't in scouting.

Therefore, if you want to know 'how many girls aren't in the girl scout?', you can simply subtract those who are part of the girl scout to the total number of girls. Hence, 120-80=40.
