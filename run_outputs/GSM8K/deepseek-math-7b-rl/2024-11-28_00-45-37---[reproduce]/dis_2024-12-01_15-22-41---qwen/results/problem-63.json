Next we need find out what happens during these last remaining six months which make up the second portion or ''other half''of our target year length of twelve individual months long. Here if follows logically that those same 6 months equate to being comprised of .9 times(a fancy mathematical way to say 90%), whatever the original monthly rate was; but since said starting figure was set at $140/month, applying this ten percent discount upon that yields $$140\\times .9=$126 /month.$$With this newly calculated value known to represent each month's fee going forward into the next section of our year-long observation period spanner, multiplying that constant new value by the quantity of six months employed in the remaining part of our defined yearly time frame ultimately results in $$\\text{SixMonths} = 126perMonth \\cdot 6 Months.=756.$$, A sum therefore found to have been paid within the latter halfportion involving the later six months constituting our chosen study window.(OneYear=840+756=$)\\boxed {1596}$aleenapayedasthetotalfortwelvemonthtotalperiod.}",

With these kinds of problems, simply break down what you know into manageable chunks and deal with them one piece at a time. Step One: Calculate how much was paid during the first half of the year Since charging is done monthly, and each month's rent or subscription fee came out to $140, during the first six months (the first half), ten months worth of subscriptions would obviously cost 6*$140= $840 .Step Two: Next find the rate for the remaining part of the year Normally when something is discounted by X percent, multiplying the original price by (1-X/100) will give you the new price. Here discounting of 10%, meant we multiply the price for each month going forward as follows:$140x(1-10/100)= $140x0.9 = $126 That\u2019s the premium charged per month for the latter half of the year.
