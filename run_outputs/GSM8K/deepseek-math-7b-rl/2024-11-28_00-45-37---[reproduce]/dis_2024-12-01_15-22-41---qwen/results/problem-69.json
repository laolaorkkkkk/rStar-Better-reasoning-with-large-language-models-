Solve equation; Subtract four from both sides yields:$ X+=100\u221240,$ or $x=60$. Hence , Baileystartedwith sixtydollars..(Simplifying right hand side).$ \\$ \\boxed{60}$is your required initial fund level",
        " eight weeks we see she ended up having $100 which includes both what she was already holding plus this additional payment towards her weekly allowance. Therefore you can represent the starting sum as X (initially held) + the earned based off your allowance ($40). This idea lets us set up our equation. Since ending totals need to be represented as well, we make the equation: X + 40=100 . Solve for X to find out initial holdings.. To solve for X rearrange the equation by subtracting 40 from BOTH sides getting: X+40-40 = 100-40 reducing down to your X=60 meaning initially bailey held sixty bucks.So mathematically speaking; Let Baileys Starting Amount Be S, And Number Of Weeks Multiplied By Weekly Allowance Equals Total Gained From Alowance(Y), Then Equation Is Set Up As :S+(NumberofWeeks*Weeklyallowance)=TotalAmountWithUsinLatterCase:S +(8*$5) = $100 or S + $40=$100 therefore S =$100-$40 Or S = $60 Which Means That InitiallyShe Held Sixty Bucks...You Can Plug Your ",
        " earned form allowance. To find outher original amount we need solve this equation B (original amount) + 40 (allowance earnings) =$100(ending balance). Rewrite as algebraic expression :B+40=100$. Solve one step at time: First subtract 40 from both sides leaving us with just 'b': b=100\u221240 or using our calculator b=(what\u2019s the result?) , which equals $\\boxed{60}$. This means initially bailey was carrying sixty bucks around!",
        " means we can set up this equation; X (starting amount) + 40(weekly allowance)=100 Final Total Amount . To solve let\u2019s isolate variable one side alone first subtracting forty both sides or simply add mentally $. It simplifies down into our unknown which was the StartAmount equals ten only$. Which makes sense because you wouldn\u2019t expect someone receiving just under double their original value ($40+$60=$100). Therefore Baileys initial beginning sum came out being sixty bucks!.",
        " much she initially had let us take away what she earned through allowances form this sum.$100$- $40$= $60 $. Therefore, we conclude that BAILEY STARTED WITH (INITIAL AMOUNT) WAS ($60$).So our required value was indeed 'the initial amount'. And it equals six tens or sixty $(or simply put,\\boxed{60}).",
        " initially had $60 before receiving the allowance payments throughout the 8 weeks",

        " over eight weeks she would receive $40 as an allowance. We know also that ultimately during these 8 weeks together saving or having account balance totaling up being equaled to hundred dollar ($100). Therefore all one needs simply subtract totals spent (or earned) out of initial value/values available which actually meant deducting Total Allowance Money i.e., $$40$ From Final Value /Values Available here namely $$100$. Mathematically expressed it looks like; Initial Amount Of Money=Final Value Or Value(s)-Total Values Spent Including Allowances Which Gives us I=$100-$40 Thus yielding our result as:$I=$60.$So bailey initially had sixty bucks before starting off any chores till eighth week ending finally accumulating upto actual count($100)$ once other sums included into consideration!",
        " weeks Bailey ended up having or possessing $100 all together; therefore to find out what original sum of money bailey initially possessed before receiving any allowance can be calculated as follows...Take the ending value ($100) minus (her earnings/allowance which amounts to$40). Thus it would evaluate as such $100-$40= $60 . Therefore you can conclude that Bailey began with $60 prior to starting her allowance.Thus your solution is $\\boxed{$60}$.",
        " initially held prior to receiving any allowance payments; therefore our equation would look like such: Allowance earnings plus initial holdings equals ending balance (in other words,$40+X=$100). Solve algebraically to get your solution: Begin by subtracting forty dollars from both sides of the equation thus:$40+X-$40= $100-$40 which simplifies down into :$x=60 meaning Bailey began with sixty dollars before starting to receive her allowances!So according tot eh question\"the value fornis \". ",
        " above; our equation can be expressed like so: (starting amount)x + ($amount earned) = Total Amount Ending Inventory Or in numerical terms it would look something like this. X+($40)=$100 First, let us subtract out the earnings of tennerdollars during those three months: Remember subtraction undoes addition so we simply perform (X)+(+$40)-($40). Doing that operation results in X=$100-$40 Thusly simplifying further until you get your result! Finally performing said operations shows that starting inventory was represented correctly as X=60 Dollars initially present just prior receipt of future wages via paycheck among other channels\u2026solutions my friend"
