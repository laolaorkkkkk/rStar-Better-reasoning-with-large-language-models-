Let's start by calculating just how much bigger each product line could potentially get. First off, consider all those gold bracelets... because of rising demand, folks want them more than ever these days. Their makers are anticipating a 2.5% jump in sales over the next year. Twenty-five percent of $5,000 is (2.5/100)*$5,000 = $125 which represents the increase in value of the bracelet lines. Adding that to their current value, $5,000 + $125 = $5,125 gives us the estimated future value of the bracelet business. Next, take a look at electronics news. It looks like the gadget designers are expecting a 1.2% spike in quarterly sales numbers soon. A little less significant but still positive nevertheless!. They anticipate a raise of twelve percent of eight thousand dollars, or (1.2/100)*$8,000 = $96 As of now, their wares are sold for $8,000 a box. Add that anticipated increase to the current price tag: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096 This lets us know what their future value might be if sales keep increasing at this rate. Finally!,we needto figure outwhichproduct offers amore lucrative forecastfor the company hoping to buy into this trendiest stuff before anyone else does! Since $5,125 > $8,096 we can see that investing in the Bracelet Line yields greater returns even though the increase in sales isn\u2019t quite as high Percentage Change Formula usually refers to the percent change in value algebraically. Although not specifically used by all mathematicians, this formula is helpful to some because it can help provide a relationship between an initial value (x), a final value (y), and the percent change between them (%\u2206). %\u2206=[((y\u2212x)/x)] \u00d7 100 Here y equals the final value, x equals the initial value (the value before the change), and %\u2206 is the percent change.

A lower profit margin can also be arrived at mathematically through the concept of relative returns.. Relative Returns help us arrive at the point of maximum profitability quicker in comparison to always calculating absolute levels of profits under different scenarios which could get monotonous! To calculate relative returns simply divide the differential profit level by initial investment for both options :(i). Differential profit level at Max Return Point from Jewelry : $125/(Initial Investment in Jewelery: $5000 )*100=(2.5%) :(ii). Diferential Profit Level at max return point from electronics gadget purchase option:$96/( Initial investment: $8000)*100=(1.2%). It becomes clear from here on why relative returns are more meaningful in terms of measuring the true profitability of one purchase over another!. Even though electrical appliance sales fetch higher Absolute Profits in dollar terms still considering the respective purchases sizes shows that jewellery products offer significantly higher ROI figure thereby nullifying previous assumption about the superiority of buying expensive items having deep discounts offered by retailers!. While higher raw numbers may initially lead you to believe that Jewelry makes for a comparatively better option because of its superior differential profit margins however what gets ignored at times is the impact of absolute purchase prices themselves on the relative returns therefore it is imperative to consider both aspects whilst making a decision since jewelry despite generating marginally higher overall absolute returns turns out to lose out when we consider its performance against other investments considered due to its larger base asset size( electronic appliances being comparatively cheaper ). Therefore it all boils down to the principle that although absolute levels of profits generated might be enticing they fail to take into consideration the proportion of the base investment and therefore end up rendering faulty judgement often leading to inappropriate decisions hence it becomes all the more important to take into account relative returns so as to make accurate judgements.. From a purely mathematical standpoint; Higher the ROI",
