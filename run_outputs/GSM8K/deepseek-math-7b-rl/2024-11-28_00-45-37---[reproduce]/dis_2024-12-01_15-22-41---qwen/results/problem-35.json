E g : if a bank rate increases its interest offer from 5 percent to 5.5 percent , this is called a riseof `percentage points'. We say `the interest rate increased by half a percentage point '.

Keep this fact in mind --->during the next twenty minute period our friend racked up not 4 but rather hidden variable R=5 point; so What adds 25 percent to something, leaves us with 1.25 times the original value (think about it, any number, say 4 --->4+25%(4)=4+1=5 = 1.25*4).

Okay fine maybe not. Hmm let me try another method since I clearly didn't use enough scratch paper the first time around.. We still need our initial four points so far .. then take twenty multiply by one whatever that means... oh yeahhhh right 20*.25=5 points extra plus our original four.....

Alrighty ho hold on to your hats GUYS because I am going to show you a freaking amazing tip to ace this problem in about three shakes of a lamb's tail.... Guess what?! When you see 'more than' with percents, especially when the problem actually asks you for thetotal, you can bet your bottom dollar it's going to be easier to multiply rather than add (unless stated otherwise OF COURSE you should always obey the order of operations and add or whatever comes first before multiplying but usually with percent problems it's either one or the other) Multiplying that out... well First off we want to find out what 25% of our original 4 points is.. Well 25%=.25 Move that decimal over one and you get... yep, exactly that: .25 X 4=1 And guess what that means?... It means that 25% more than our original four points is simply FOUR PLUS ONE OR FIVE POINTS!!! Whoa Nelly!!! WELL THAT WASNICE AND QUICK Right and since we already figured out we made four points in the first half of the game all we have left to do is add our newfound five points to our original four points and presto! Magic! 4+5=nine points grand total To make sure you have it right (don't worry we all do sometimes) Four original points plus five points from the second set adds up to......... Nine Points Total",

Finally, we can also just calculate this directly...if every game lasts TWICE AS LONG (which it obviously doesn't but that was merely an exercise), THEN during the entire contest he would average (4+5)/2=4.5 per 20 minute half. And since the whole thing lasted 40 minutes, THAT means he averaged .45*.4 or rather played right at PAR! AND thus made TOTALLY NORMAL PLAY OF ..... exactly 9 points!!!!",
