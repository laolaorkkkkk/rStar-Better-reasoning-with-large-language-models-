        " Since Sheila bought 5 cells phones for $150 each, this means the total price was 5*$150=$750. This amount would go towards paying off all units if no interest applied. However since a 2% interest charge applies per phone (and thus also across all 5), first let us find out what these charges add up to as well. As our base value here is once again $750 but this time it serves as the basis for calculating percentages based upon or associated with it; multiplying this by 2/100 yields \u20b1(750)*(2/100)=$15 which therefore represents said annual charge incurred when buying these particular mobile devices .

To make such assessment we simply divide 2/100 upon 4 since a year consists of four quarters or four times 90 equals 360. By doing so we get around 0.5 % as representing the equivalent proportion applicable towards a quarter within the total calendar year context. Following this line of thought we know therefore that customers of this provider would be charged approximately 0.5 % of the original sum mentioned above ($750). Converting this percentage into actual numbers turns out 0.5 /100*750 =$3.75 which represents precisely how much extra client needs to cough up due to its dealing terms & conditions including those fees associated with paying bills over a duration longer than single month but shorter than overall twelve periods during a year.

Each payment comes out to\\[\\dfrac{$\\$86.25 \\div \\cancel{3}}{\\cancel{3}}= \\$\\boxed{$28.75$}\\}. Total Cost: You can also solve this problem using an alternate approach. We know that instead of multiplying $\\$15 \\cdot 5$, we could first multiply $\\$15$ by $.02$ and add that product to $\\$15$ three times to find our total cost. Doing such a calculation, we get $(15+ (.02)(15))\\cdot 3 = 15(1+.02)\\cdot 3 =(15)(1.02)(3)=51\\cdot 1.02=(51)(1+.02)$$=51+(.02)(51)$$= 51 + 1.02 = 52.02,$$ which confirms our earlier solution!. This method might seem overly complicated but it is important you understand what is really happening when using percent increases or decreases.. Instead increasing something by 2$\\%$is equivalent to multiplying by $1+.02= 1.02.$ Therefore ifyou wantedto increase $\\$15$ by 2$\\%$, like we did above,. To check yourself work backwards and divide your answer by 1.02 to make sure you indeed got $\\$75.$ As shown below \\[\\dfrac{\\$28.75 \\div .02}{\\cancel{1.02}}=\\dfrac{\\$28.75}{\\cancel{.02}\\times \\cancel{1.02}}=\\$1437.5.\\]That was way off the $\\$75$ we expected so we know our answer wasn't $\\$28.75",
