Let me fix that instead of stating that each chicken gets 1 cup in each of its 3 meals let's rather say that each MEAL for each chick gets one cup-- Ok... so we know that for 20 chickens served 3 times a day (each time with one cup) would mean a total of 20*3 = 60 cups fed over three meals daily were to continue this way.
