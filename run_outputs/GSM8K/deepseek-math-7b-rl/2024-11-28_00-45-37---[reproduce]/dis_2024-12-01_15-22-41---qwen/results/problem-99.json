This question involves distribution and combination concepts within AP Physics B. As such, solving it through the use of basic algebra alone requires a degree of insight not always found in well constructed problems of this type. Fortunately though for aspiring engineers potential problem spots name from experience and familiarity so seeing that a simple solution was forthcoming permitted a simple algebraic approach to be used provided enough attention was given to detail during the process. It might help to remember the acronym PEMDAS when dealing with these types of problems. That stands for Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction respectively. From left to right, start performing calculations wherever possible, and follow the same order of operations (PEMDAS) when necessary while solving a problem.
