We can denote areas captured through sequence starting from Bottom Most One , going up like V1(bottom),V2,v3.....Vn(Top).

Okay now since we solved for Initial unknown variable X=Base Layer Sq footage =128 .

        " geometric progression with first term(a) as 'Base Area', common ratio (r) as '0.5'(reduction by half), and number of terms(n) as '4'. We know that sum of n terms of a GP is given by : $$S_n=a\\frac{(1\u2212r^n)}{(1\u2212r)}$$. Substituting the values into this formula yields:- Sum($S_n$) = $$\\frac{B * (1-(0.5)^4)}{1 - 0.5}$$ => \\( \\frac{B * (1 - 0.0625)}{0.5}\\) => \\( \\frac{B * 0.9375}{0.5} \\) => \\( 1.875 * B\\). Since it was mentioned previously that the Base Area or the 4th level area = 16 sq m . Therefore ,cumulative area across all four levels i.e Sn = 1.875* Base Area =>Sn = 1.875x16=>Sn=30 From this we can say that over entire four floors combined there is 30sqm of area coverage.To find Average Area simply divide Total area with Number of Floors so Average Area =(sn/number of levels)=>(30)/4=>7.5 But Notice carefully since the problem specifically mentions Each floor has HALF the AREA of previous floor therefore resulting in a Geometric Progression and using the properties of GP we calculated the SUM of those areas (Sn).Though this approach is also accurate and you would reach the correct option but the intended method used was through GP which leads us to quicker and accurate solution",
        " Therefore its summation would be :$$ S_n = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} .$$ Here, $a_1=16$, $r=\\frac{1}{2}$,and n=4.$$S_{4}=(16) \\cdot \\frac{1-(\\frac{1}{2})^{4}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}$$= (16) \\cdot(2 -\\frac{1}{4})= (16)\\cdot(\\frac{7}{4})=35 $$So ,total area under all levels including base level amounts upto 35 sq meterNow nof simply divide this figure wit hnumber oflevels+1i .e$\\frac { Tota Larea }{( N oof le v els)+ 1 }$or$\\fra c{ 35}{( 4 )+ 1}$o r,$ \\frac { 35 }{ 5 }.$.Hence ",
