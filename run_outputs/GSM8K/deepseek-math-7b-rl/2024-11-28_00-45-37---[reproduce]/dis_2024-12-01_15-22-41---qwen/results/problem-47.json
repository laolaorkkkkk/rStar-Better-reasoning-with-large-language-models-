        " we can find out how many this buys him by dividing $200/40 = 5$ bags of blue ties. Similarly when it comes to calculating price of red ties which stated in the question was \"twice as many\" but also at \"50% more\" price than regular ones, realizing that a 50% increase of something means adding half its value onto self to get the new value, so each red tie would cost $40 + $40*(50%/100%) = $40 + $20 = $60.$ From here figuring out how much all these red ties cost becomes simply $60 * 10 = 600$, add the above result of $200 into summation we obtain grand total sum of $600 + 200 = 800$. As such no further steps need to be taken leaving you with your solution looking like this:$800",

Hence the total amount spent on red ties amounts to $60\\times10 = 600$. The total amount spent on both types of ties thus results from adding together these two sums, i.e., it equals $200+600=$$800 .",

        " total cost of all the red ties is $60 \\times 10 = 600$. Thus adding this to the cost of the blue ties we get the grand total to be $200 + 600 = 800 $. Therefore John spends $\\boxed{800}$ dollars altogether.",
        " of 200 upon blue ties costing 40 apiece it equals this result simply represented by algebra as $\\frac {200}{40}=N_b which yields N_b=5 .$ With basic interpretation that means indeed he bought 5 units of these cheaper items amounting to blue ties; moreover since according to the words used in the problem statement he buys double the number of Red ties B compared to Blue ties N_b ,we get easily deduced that Number of Red Ties N_r is double the lesser number of blue ones namely satisfying the equation like this N_r=2\u00d7(Number of Blue ties)=2Nb .Then we put in numbers so that would read algebraically as $N_r = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10$ thus yielding explicitly R = 10 without any further calculation needed whatsoever finally applying simple definition/concept of what the word 'more' implies we find that one Red tie costs $40 + $40 \u00d750/100 was priced at $40+.5\u00d740unit price or $40+$20 unit price leading clearly to conclude just plain common sense applied strongly dictates that EACH RED TIE WAS SOLD at $60 per piece ALGEBRAICALLY STATED It translates via equation into :$40+(40\u2217.5)costing instead of only $40 individually sold becomes $$Revenue i.e.$$ Sales Price SP =$40 + $20 addition right ? obviously giving $60 dollar sales prize per stick ....Now multiply it out !
