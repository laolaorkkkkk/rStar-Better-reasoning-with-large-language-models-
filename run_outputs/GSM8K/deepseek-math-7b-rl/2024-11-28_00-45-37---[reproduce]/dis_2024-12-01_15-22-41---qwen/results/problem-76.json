A typical lifespan for a dog can range anywhere from 5 to 15 years, but let's assume for sake of calculation that dogs typically live 10 years. Given our starting point of 180 days into the future when dogs start their second stage of feeding requirements, if the average lifespan of a dog is considered to be ten years, or 365*10= 3650 days in total, subtracting out those initial 180 days leaves us with 3650 - 180 = 3470 days during which the dog will require the larger portion of feeding regimen consisting of 2 cups/day.

Subtract the number of days spent on the 'first tier' regimen from the general lifespan length: 3650 - 180 = 3470 days spent on the higher volume feeding schedule during the first twelve months plus the initial 180 days; split this remainder into first and second half phases 2.

That said, to figure out how many days fall under this second phase, subtract the first 180 days from the total lifespan projected, which amounts to calculation: 7300-180 = 7120 remaining days.

With this revision to the problem, whenever we see a requirement like \u201ca certain number\u201dof things (such as dogs) plus a remainder, always check to see whether you might be mixing up the order of addition or multiplication! Seeing the above scenario, adding 180 + 6940 was wrong because it was trying to force the puppy to eat 7120 cups of food first, and only then determine how many bags can be filled from what\u2019s left over, when clearly the right approach is to start with however many bags one can buy and THEN see how many extra cups of that last one can hold such that the next partial one isn\u2019t wasted.

Going back to the beginning of the problem it makes sense to switch the order of calculations. Instead, add up the individual amounts according to the original wording of the question ie. Add the portions for the first 180 days to the future daily requirements portion; i.e. Calculate: [{1\u00d7180}+({2\u00d73470)}]={180+6940}=7120 .

Thus far your equation translates into something looking like this 180 +      = Total number of cups used over lifetime according to feeding plan laid out initially .

Let\u2019s assume our dog lives exactly 12 years (which is equivalent to 365*12=4380 total days lived). Thus since we know it reaches the 180 day milestone already\u2026that means the length of the latter set of days can be found like so: 4380 - 180 = 4200 days remain (as the dog ages through its lifetime for the purposes of this calculation).

        " cups of dog food over this period. Next calculate the remaining life expectancy of the pup... Given that the average lifespan of a dog is roughly ten years which equates to about 365 days multiplied by ten to equal approximately 3650 days; when taking away those initial 180 days we find the difference leaves us with 3650 - 180 = 3470 days.... This represents the length of time during which the puppy will require 2 meals worth of food per day because of these extra days . Multiply the number of remaining days (of the entire span minus starter basis) by the weight of meal required for larger days yielding 3470 * 2 = 6940 net cups.. Add together both figures representing amounts obtained separately allowing us to conclude that throughout their lives dogs eat A total of 6940+180=7120 Cups That figure divided by what one container may hold shows us it requires Roughly 7120 \u00f7 110 = ~64 containers! However We know said Pup won\u2019t live THAT Long & can reasonably assume no owner would purchase close to seven dozen cans of kibble considering current set price range without having significantly extended shelf Life expectancies figured above ...
