As this process happens annually till it reaches your desired target period (in which you wish to find out Sylvanus future salary), repeat the above steps again considering the already adjusted value of Sarah's base salary ($660) for subsequent years when applicable. Calculating further; For second year, she receives another increment of $66 making her new monthly pay $660+$66= $726and a corresponding annual salary of 12*726=$8712 . And finally calculating for third year, Sally receives yet another increment of $72.6 bringing her current salary to $726+72.6= $798.6 Monthly or equivalently 12\u00d7$798.6=$9583.2per annum respectively. From our calculation, therefore, having served the company faithfully for five years ,Sylvia ' s anticipated annual salary after three more years of dedicated ser vice under the current increment policy would amount to $9,583.2 Annually if unchecked for any change in the company structure or policy affecting pay scales",

Adding this figure to her base pay which remains constant through these four years ($600x12months x 5years = $36000).
