Finally, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Subtracting 2 from the total number of jewels Aaron has gives us a total of 25 - 2 = 23 jewels for Siobhan.So,the correct sequence of operations to obtain the value A (representing the age difference when C was younger), B (representing Markus' current age), and D (representing Carl's future age), respectively based off these equations alone depends upon knowing certain information or conducting further calculations specific to those variables as well. However if you can provide details regarding their ages it may allow me better assistance moving forward!",
        " which is stated to be 2 less than what Aaron has, just subtract 2 away from 25 (the number of jewels Aaron has). This results in calculating 25\u22122 or simply 23. Thus, our answer is 23.
