We start working with raw eggs again since no one wants to buy half a dozen or so many different ways as possible might prove useful when making mistakes or just getting confused. First let\u2019s figure out how many eggs get produced each week before any are sold:$\\text{eggs laid per week}=(252\\: \\text{per day})(\\text{7 days})=\\text{1764}$.Now if Lloyd sells each egg individually he would take $2$/$12$=1/6th off of that right?? No way could it possibly makethatmuchmoney wtf is wrong with me...... oh nevermind deletingmyself.... anyway continuingwiththisbadideawouldshowourprofitmarginonanindividualeggbasisis\\$((2)(1/6))=\\$1/3or about thirty three cents. Is that what you wanted to hear Chief??? Nahiknow what I meant was that selling eggs on an individual basis would require dividing \\$\\$1764 into 1764 equal parts thusly\\[\\frac{\\$1764}{1764\\ eggs}=\\$1/egge\\]very interesting but unfortunately useless because we want to sell whole eggsnot halvesso lets move alongwhatifwe grouped eggs by twelves(one dozen)since customers oftenpurchase exactlythatfor their baking needsandcalculatingthe profit margins based on those groups rather than single eggs would look like this\\[\\frac{\\$2 \u00d7 1764 \\text{",
