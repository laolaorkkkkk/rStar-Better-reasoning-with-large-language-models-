        " means this person (Sarah) cleans up four units because you know these words 'times'. As it happens per unit or piece we need broken down things into several parts so just dividing everything when mentioned about quantity through any specific entity helps making easier to solve problems involving comparisons .This way ,You would multiply Or Divide whichever operation seems right depending upon directions provided within problem statement itself !In case present above :We want no Of loads carried out By Rayan Vs Dave..So first let us find Out what Exactly Does Each One Do ? Well Since Sarai ds Laundry Is Four Times Davids That essentially implies When david carries N Units load sarah Would take Away 4N ..Now coming To Ranya part who only does Half What Maryam does ..that Means Instead O taking away 4N ;Raney Only takes away 2n UNITs worthy work/load !! SO Here We go again With another algebraic expression containing variables whose value needs computation via substitution method whenever required scenarios appear!",
        " hour. Since raymond only needs time equal fractionally smaller than sara because Rachel\u2019S workload takes less work when compared to those who handles david ' S affairs . Thus , we find out what portion was occupied through ralph\u2018s load versus dave ` S job involves setting up equation involving fractions such rhonda=Xand dav e equals Y Where X/Y=(\u00bd). Solving this simplifies into isolated variable Rhonda By multiplying both sides Of Equation above With ( y) it helps Cancel Out right side leaving justx all alone standing thus solving our problem signifying proportionately fewer duties towards Raynald relative Dave ! From here We plug known values SARAs loads totals being equivalent twelve hundred Into previous expression three quartersORHonda Is replaced thereby converting Improper Fraction To Mixed form yields Two Hundred Twenty Fifths As quotient Remainder indicating Amount leftover would go missing during balancing tasks associated larger size pile assignments obviously take longer processing!. Although somewhat complex looking initially appears straightforward once simplified further breakdown based algebraic expressions relations provided greatly aids streamlining process leading successful conclusion desired result",
        " the weight Laura works through (Raymond)from what Johnathan finishes(David). Therefore we know Samuel spends just $(\\text {sarahs load})/2= (\\frac{400}) / {(2)} =$ so Raymound picks up only ,pounds while david completes all .Therefore sam fills out $(100)-(50)= $$\\boxed{50}$. Hence johnathon cleans fifty percent less than joshua!",

To find out what david's load was We make;  4x=400 solve this equation ; divide both sides By four : X=(400/4) which comes up with Davids loads being equal to   100pounds Of laundry per week\rNow coming back o raymond,,if Rayanndo does one hlaf AS MUCHLaundry As sarah would mean;.

Similarly, knowing Rayman usually cleansed about halfway than Sarayu means R=(S/2), meaning rymanywould generally clean out just 20% less clothings compared to sarrah . thus it looks like cleaningr(raymond) comes equal tor = ((400)/2)=<strong><em>[tex] \\boxed{200} [/tex]</em></strong>.
