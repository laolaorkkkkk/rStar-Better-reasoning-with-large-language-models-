When calculating the average mileage per gallon, instead of dividing the total number of miles driven (\\(100\\) miles) by the difference in gallons measured when refilling the tank (\\((12 - 4)\\) or \\(8 \\)gallons), we actually need to divide it by the amount of gas used, which is just the amount initially filled into the tank (\\(4\\) gallons).
