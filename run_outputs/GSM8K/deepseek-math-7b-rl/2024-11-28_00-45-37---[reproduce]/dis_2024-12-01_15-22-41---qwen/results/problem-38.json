Q: John ran 8 kilometers in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 20 seconds. What was his average speed? A: To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. First, let's convert all the units to be the same. We'll use hours for the time because the distance is given in kilometers and it would be simplest to have both in the same units. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so 1 hour, 40 minutes, and 20 seconds is equal to $$1 + \\frac{40}{60} + \\frac{20}{3600} = 1 + \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{180} = 1 + 0.6667 + 0.0056 = 1.6719$$hours Therefore, his average speed is $$\\frac{8 km}{1.6719 hr} = 4.79 km/hr.$$So, John's average speed was approximately 4.79 km/hr. Note that in calculating averages such as this one (which involves dividing something measured in kilometers by another quantity also measured in kilometers), your final answer will always be expressed in whatever unit you get when you perform the division operation involved; thus if I drove say 'x' kilometers during a period of 'y' hours long then my average speed ends up being $\\boxed{\\frac{km}{hour}} $.",
        " John runs 3 hours one day and half as long (which would mean) or .",
        " day, he runs for 3 hours. On the following two days (the rest of the week), he runs for half the amount of the first day, which means he runs for 3/2=1.5 hours per day. Therefore, the total running time for one week would be calculated like so: First day: 3 hours Second & third day combined: 1.5*2 = 3 hours Total weekly running time: 3+3 = 6 hours Since John usually runs 60 miles every week while covering these six hours, speed equals distance divided by time or 60 / 6hours. His average running speed therefore comes out to exactly ten mph!",

        " up all those times together: 3 (from the first day) + 2*1.5 (from the following two days). This equals to 3+3=6 hours per week. Since Jhon usually runs sixty miles every seven days using our calculation above; It would follow therefore that His Running Speed Is Total Distance / Total Time Taken , or 60 Miles / 6 Hours = Ten Miles Per Hour! Therefore, you see what kind of runner John really is... A FAST one!.",
        " = 1.5 hours per day. Therefore, over the three days of the week, he runs a total of 3 (for the first day) + 2*1.5 (for the next two days) = 3+3=6 hours. Since these six hours represent one week of training, it follows that during any particular week, if asked about what speed or rate was used while exercising daily?, you would correctly determine your weekly mileage /weekly hour totals; so therefore dividing sixty(60) miles into those six(6)hours shows us he runs ten mph!",
        " hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours per week. Since John typically covers 60 miles within those six hours every week (because it said so), you divide your weekly mileage requirement by the amount of weeks spent running(i.e., if john ran eight miles a week over four weeks,thenyou would divide 8 byfourto getthe speed). That results into calculating the following equation: Speed=Distance / Time . Within our example calculation therefore looks like this : Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours =10milesper hour..So ,johnRunsAt A SPEED OF 10 MILES PER HOUR.!",

Given that John usually runs 60 miles weekly while spending six hours doing so tells us what speed he maintains during his workouts; namely, v = d / t which reads Speed equals Distance divided by Time or here it can be seen as Miles Per Hour(MPH)=Miles/Hours thus MPH = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 mph.So if you take your time adding up those equations correctly, I found out through working backwards using what was given in the prompt ,that john ran at a speed of ten miles hourly!",
        " days, we add up all the times together: 3 (first day) + 1.5 (second day) + 1.5 (third day). This equals 6 hours per week. Since John runs 60 miles every week over those six hours, let\u2019s divide distance / time to find out what speed equates to it, so therefore Speed=distance/time; or here S=60mi./6hr.; That simplifies down to s=(60/6)=(10mph.)Therefore ,the rate was found being equivalent exactly ten mile(in one hour)-Mph.(as shown above)! As such,(since both sides involve differentunits )our solution holds true& correct .",

To determine his average speed (the distance he ran divided by the amount of time it took him), divide the total number of miles by the total number of hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 mph.

        " Since it takes him twice as long as the first day (which was already stated), but only one hour per session rather than both sessions totaling longer than an hour, [((firstday)*(secondsession))*numberofdays]. This results into [(firstday)*.5]*numberofdays=[(3)*.5]*2=(1.5)*2=3...but wait! That isn't right--that would just be HALF of what he ran during those two days. Instead, since it says 'twice', not 'half,' we use simple multiplication: ((FirstDay)*2)=3*2=6 . From here its easy; Just add up all your totals to get the overall sum (or, in this case, subtraction since the question asks for remaining amount); Like so: TotalWeekRunTime = WeekTotal - DayOne ; or  TWRT=WT-D1 , plugging in values we have: TWRT=23-(18+x) --->TWRT=23-18 ------> TWRT=5 ...and thats our value :)",
        " variables.

Adding those three totals together yields a weekly running clock time of 3+1.5+1.5=6 hours/week. To ascertain his speed(in miles per hour) one simply needs to divide the number of miles he runs a week by the number of hours he runs that week. That would be calculated like this\u2026..Speed= Miles/Hour... 60miles/6hours= 10mph....So.....the correct calculation shows that even though he initially appeared to be running less on two of the days, because those two days required him to run for lesser amounts of time, once you add up all the time across the week it equals out and results in what appears to be a simpler calculation involving just the three \u201cstaple\u201d days versus trying to keep track of multiple different running times.Thusly speaking; doing so reveals far easier math requiring but one simple division operation vis-a-vis having to work with four times the amount of variables if you failed to identify and recognize commonalities among the various days\u2026and instead tried to cram in all four into a single generic formulaic equation i.e.: 3+(3/2)+(3/2)......This additional complexity would increase the chances of careless errors and lead to excess convoluted calculations that are best avoided whenever possible via clear identification/recognition of patterns and simpler means to solve such problems rather than more complex methods involving unnecessary variables and operations!In conclusion , while the simplistic approach may have us dividing only two numbers ultimately resulting in an easy solution compared against if say using the alternative overly complicated method involvingmorevariablesoroperations\u2013itisthesimplerapproachthatisgenerallypreferableasitisbothlesslikelytoinvolveerrorswhilealso being considerably easier overall especially when dealing with mentalmathandproblemtypeswhere haste can lead one down wrong paths leading inevitably toward frustration which often leads back towards the simpler way\u2026\u2026Therefore always look foralternativesimplerapproacheswheneverpossibleandinthiscaseavoidingexcesscomplexityleadsto greater ease throughout AND reduced chance for human error",
        " T=d/2 or since we determined M(on day)=3; therefore Saturday+Sunday--T=3/2.. And finally per instruction add up all three values sumtotal distance covered W=M+T*2...so substituting appropriately W=3+(3/2)*2 ; simplify inside parentheses firstly W=3+((3)(2))/(2)(2) which further simplifies to....W=3+(6/4). Next in order to add these numbers, we need to convert 3 into a fraction with a denominator of 4; this can be achieved easily by multiplying top/bottom by 4/4 thus arriving at 12/4. Now rewrite expression W=(12/4)+(6/4) ...........Finally, adding numerators according to the regular rules of addition/expression equivalence W=(18/4); therefore converting from improper fraction back into mixed notation yields\u2026.[the speed]of.....4.5milesrunashourly",
