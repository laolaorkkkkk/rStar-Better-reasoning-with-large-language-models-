        " Corey, which means Amy is 11-2=9 years old. And we remember that Amy was described as being 5 years older than Jackson, therefore Jacksons age can found when subtracting those extra 5years off Aime's known age making this equation (9)-5=(Jackson) four meaning jackson only would need to fill out what makes up these last few missing marks into 'x'. This translates too : X+(X*Y)=Z or simply put it like . Therefore leaving us knowing yhe variable equals , coming down to three plus another unknown(three ) equaling six.(the remaining amount still needed/to come). Finally working backwards again revealing our long awaited result! Again going back...therefore bringing through simple logic,(James /Corey Age)-(Amy Older Than Jackson)=(Jackins Old), leading us well onto figuring; ((11Age)+(9))-((Alpha)+-(Beta))=Joshua S age....which simplifies nicely if you place all numbers & variables inside one big parentheses..looks something like (((age cory)+(james))/(alpha Beta))+(-jack)...leaves short cuts along way showing Joshua=. Also could translate even further adding everything together till its broken apart completely resulting in just looking josiah!. It might not seem logical right away but trust me once your actually doing math problems while running errands or hangingout w friends etc trying desperately figure out problem space youre locked into,& believe me solving issues becomes alot easier especially breaking complicated overall look down simpler components parts rather taking fight whole thing altogether,.
