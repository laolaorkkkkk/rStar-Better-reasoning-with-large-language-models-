We also note the fact that when Tom gets back home from object 4, assuming he made the same route back over the original path, the distance covered during the return journey would still be 'x', but this time he only went 'home' at a reduced speed of six mph; again using the formula speed*time=distance gives us 6*(t') = x, because 't' represents the amount of time spent returning home from objective No. 4. Since both distances are equal, we may set the two equations above equal to each other as follows: 10*t = 6*(t'), and solve this equation for the unknown variable 't'. Dividing both sides of the equational statement above by their greatest common factor which is 2 provides: 5*t = 3*(t'). Again solving for 't' algebraically we obtain:(5/3)*(t) = t',thus if it takes 5/3 times the initial value of 't\" to make up the travel time 't'\" it simply means that 't' was less than the new adjusted time unit called 't'\", specifically t= (3/5)*t', therefore making the outbound trip took three-fifths the duration of the homeward leg. Finally knowing that tom came back home between 4 o'clock, and leaving home at 1 o'clock means a difference or run time of ONLY THREE HOURS in total, $(1+t)=(4)$, from which we find that $t=3$, meaning it took exactly three hours to complete the first or outward bound journey.

Solving the above equation for one of the variables and substituting it into the second equation is the best course of action to take next. Isolating b in the first equation we get: b=(10t)/6. Next we substitute this newly found value of b into the second equation replacing b with (10t)/6 and get: (10t)/6 + t = 3. Multiplying all values inside and outside of parentheses by 6 yields: 10t + 6t = 18. Adding like terms simplifies it further to 16t = 18. Divide both sides by 16 gives us: t= 18/16 which reduces to .875. This cannot be correct since the journey lasted three hours max and included stops to eat and rest along the way.

Since the right sides of both equations equal the same thing (10x) then the left sides must be equivalent as well or 60t = 60b. Divide both sides by 60 and you get t=b.

Since Tom was traveling at a speed of 10 miles per hour and he sailed from 1 to 4 PM, which means he was sailing for 3 hours, we multiply the speed by the time to find out the distance. Distance=Speed*Time or D=ST Therefore; (D)istance=(S)peed(T)ime becomes D=10mph*3hours thusly resulting into a calculated value for distance being D=30miles Also this same reasoning applies to getting back since Travelling Back also involves travelling a direct route coming back From Point B To Point A over exactly the Same Path used Coming From Point A To PointB Thus applying once again our formula but this time around using a different Speed altogether namely S=rate or speed as Being Speeded Upwards written At/Or With Respect to/Regarding Going Downwards /Coming Towards us being 6 Miles Per Hour And Time taken being what we wish to solve For Let Us Denote It As T Our Formula rewrites itself yet again distanced travelled equalling Rate Times Time Or D=RT Rreferring to new instance Of rate That is Different When Compared to Previously Used Instance involving Initial stated Speed Given Earlier Which Had Value Noting ten But this time round instead having Its value as Six(6). We already established above that Distance Traveled both ways Is One And The Same .It is Immutable Both Ways. This Distance Resulted Above As Having Calculated Value Equalling Thirty (30). Returning To Application of our revised formula D=RT ,we Get 30=(6)(T), (6)(T)=30,(6/6)(t)=(30/6),(1)(t)=5 making thusly T=5 Hours Solving For Unknown Variable represented By T found above yields solution result of Five (5) meaning Tom takes Five (5) hours to return home via his journey backwards",
        " traveled for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). Therefore, the distance would be equal to speed times time or D=ST so Distance = Speed*Time which means Distance = 10 MPH*. 3 Hours .

When finding the time it took him to return you must use the same formula this time isolating time. Or T= D/S.

Therefore, Point B is located 30 miles away from point A. When tom goes backwards though, he uses the same route but obviously going in reverse. It still takes him 30 miles, however now he's only traveling at 6mph instead of the customary 10mph so to figure out how long it took him, use the old formula again but plug in new numbers. solve for 't', which is the amount of time taken. Like before, d = r*t; here, rearranging terms gives us : t = d / r , substituting our known values yields: t = 30miles / 6mph = 5 hours .
