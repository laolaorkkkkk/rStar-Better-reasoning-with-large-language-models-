        " one dog because we said so earlier.. It took us twice ten (two times 10), which equals twenty minutes(because when you multiply numbers together its like adding lots of copies of the same amount). Multiplying this time into weeks results in seven*five= thirty fifth; meaning every single weekday adds up another set totaling fifteen minute increments making them whole sets without any extra bits hanging around leftover unused portions thus having no remainder only full collections intact solid amounts themselves neat clear cut exact fits snugly fitting nicely arranged proportionately well balanced orderly organized harmoniously interwoven intricately woven complex interconnected intricate connections linking things working seamlessly smoothly efficiently effectively productively bringing everything together perfectly completing task achieving goal succeeding accomplishing finished successfully completed totality wholeness entirety perfection completion fulfillment integration unification synthesis integrating unifying synthesizing integrated unified synthesized connected linked tied intertwined web network community fabric system organization structure pattern arrangement ordering sequence order flow progression development growth process pathway path way route trail course track line length width breadth depth amplitude magnitude volume area surface measure dimension extend extent size scale rate ratio proportion relation connection link tie knot bond affinity attraction force electricity magnetism gravitation weight gravity pressure forcefield energy power potential kinetic heat temperature motion movement vibration resonance frequency wave cycle orbit ellipse sphere circle ring loop spiral helix ribbon band braid rope string thread wire cable cord strand fibre fibril filament fiber yarn twine tissue material substance stuff composition conglomerate aggregate mass matter body form shape figure mould style type design concept plan scheme strategy tactic method means mode procedure protocol standard routine rhythm cadence meter measure unit element atom molecule particle constituent ingredient component part detail item aspect side factor property characteristic feature quality attribute trait mark sign signature stamp imprint impression evidence proof indication signal witness indicator marker pointer locator pinpointer postpostition location locale place setting site spot position slot lane shelf rack tray table counter balance arm leg limb member portion piece segment section field ground base root foundation basis principle precept rule law code canon dogma tradition practice custom ritual observance ceremony rite formula equation symbology symbolism notation notational signaling signalling communication transmission exchange transaction transact trade deal bargain barter commerce market economic economical financial accounting bookkeeping tax taxation fiscal budget expenditure income revenue earnings profit return yield worth value prices cost expense charge debt liability obligation responsibility duty claim demand request requirement need want desire yearning aspiration longing wish hope expectation anticipation craving thirst hunger drive urge motivation intention purpose aim target objective ambition ideal reason thought idea conception imagination speculation conjecture hypothesis proposition view perspective vision outlook point angle degree plane space expanse terrain landscape scenery scene environment context backdrop situation circumstance condition state mood ambience atmosphere climate weather sky airspace ambiance milieu medium media ambiance ambiance background surroundings realm domain region",

        " ten dogs every single day, one needs to multiply these variables together -- or as it relates to this prompt, just add them up since multiplication could also get complicated quickly if we didn\u2019t start small like here!

        " it\u2019s equal to 10*.5 which equals 5 man hours every single day! Since this value refers directly towards one specific individual who carries multiple roles under varying circumstances such as emergencies etcetera without any additional commitments like teaching classes among others not covered hereunder so therefore calculation stands valid despite these unaccounted variables changing overall situation dynamics slightly thus making our solution somewhat oversimplified albeit accurate enough close approximations sake if exact precision isn't paramount requirement due constraints involved hereinabove mentioned exceptions present scenario though..",
        " Therefore if John needs to know how long it would last him one whole week worth of work, without stopping, We multiple the daily usage quantity by the length of the period (in this case, weeks). From above, your average daily usage was determined as being equal to three hours or so. Weekly use can easily be found by multiplying this value by seven because there are usually seven days within a standard calendar week.;therefore ,weekly use works our as :5hours/day X 7days /week which equals thirtyfivehour\\weeks"
