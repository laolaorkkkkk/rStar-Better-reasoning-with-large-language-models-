Then she would have walked 8 miles in 3 hours, making for an average speed of 8/3 or about 2.67mph, still below 4! Clearly, since the problem says she only walks at either 2, 3,or 4 mph, and we can eliminate both 2 and 3 options due to precedent, that the unknown variable X must equal 4. If she walked exactly 4 miles per hour for the additional hour, then she would have walked 8 miles in 3 hours, producing an average speed of 8/3 or approximately 2.67 mph, slightly above 2 but clearly within acceptable parameters to attain her desired average ending velocity of 4 mph.

        " To make her target average speed of exactly '4mph', if the whole hike is going to be say ''x'' miles long , it needs to be true that $$\\text{total distance}/ \\text{total time} =4 .$$ Thus we solve for $$ x / ((x-6)/4) =4$$ $$ x=((x-6)\\cdot 4 ) /4,$$ cross multiplying gets $$4x =x-6.$$ Bringing the like terms to opposite sides changes the equation to $$4x-x = -6,.$$ This simplifies further to $$ 3x =-6 ,$$ which implies $$x=-2.$$ However a distance can not possibly be negative, clearly there must have been a mistake in our computation. At this point we realize we forgot to include the last part of the hike in our equation. Including the remaining 6 miles as well as the necessary time it took to cover those miles leads us to set up:$$\\frac{x}{ ((x-6)/4 + (6-6)/4 )} =4 .$$ Simplifying the denominator on right side gives:$$\\frac{x}{((x-6)/4)} =4 .$$ Multiplying both sides by (x-6)/4 yields: $$=\\frac{x\\cdot 4}{(x-6)}=4,\\Rightarrow 4x = 4(x-6),\\Rightarrow 4x=4x-24.$$. Subtracting $4x$ from each side leaves $-24$, but this does not make any sense at all! What went wrong ? We realized above that when taking the average of a set of numbers, the total must be the same whichever way you calculate it. Here for instance we first calculated the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time, and then concluded this had to be equal to the same quotient but with the remaining distance in the numerator and the remaining time in the denominator. But this reasoning only works if the averages are the same throughout the entire journey, and we cannot assume that in this problem.We made a mistake in setting up the equation involving the averages in the first place: we cannot simply tack a certain portion of the journey onto the start or end of the trip and expect things to remain in balance that way. Instead we must consider the averages separately for each phase of the trip and match these to the target average.In other words we must look at the phases of Marissa's hike separately and recognize that in the first phase the average",

That would mean covering the last 6 miles at a rate of 1 mile per hour.

Clearly matching our previous observation.(if something takes e.g. 1 hr to happen it happened every one hour!).Therefore With only one unknown variable x,and being a relatively easy straightforward problem.It becomes quite obvious that solving for x is simply a matter of subtracting 6 from 12 leaving you with\u2026only one solution !

Thanks khw.. Corrected!! : ) Okay so Marissa walked 6 miles in one hour , to maintain a pace of 4 miles per hour over 3 hours we need to calculate how fast she would need to walk 6 miles in order to average 4 miles per hour over the course of three hours . Marissa needs to walk 6 miles in one hour to avg 4mph over 3 hrs This seems weird but I promise it makes sense if you read it slowly... Marissa has hiked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 miles in the next 1 hour. This is a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. But to avg 4mph over 3 hours, she needs to hike a total of 12 miles. So in 1 hour she needs to hike 6 miles. So she needs to walk 6 miles at a rate of _____ miles per hour. To find this we divide the number of miles she needs to walk by the number of hours she has left. 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. SO THE CORRECT ANSWER = 6",
        " your successes against all future goals potential instead!. Marissa would like To maintain abeam e=four mile pace when finished; we know d=distance traveled divided b=time taken equals r(rate desired). So,(6)/(1)=r... Desired rate over the last leg was 6mph",
        " so far before figuring out the required speed needed for the last section of the hike. Marissa walked four miles in one hour and two miles in another hour; therefore, it took her two hours to cover six miles. Since the entire hike consists of twelve miles, which means she still needs to walk 12 - 6 = 6 miles. Using our definition from earlier, we set up the equation $$\\text{speed}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}.$$ We know the desired speed for the last leg of the hike, as well as the remaining distance we need to cover. Letting T represent the remaining travel time (how long she needs to walk these 6 miles), $$T=\\frac{\\text{remaining distance}}{\\text{desired speed}}=\\frac{6}{4}.$$ Simplifying yields $$T=\\frac{3}{2}$$ hours or one and a half hours. This relates to our original requirement that the average speed would be four miles per hour since both sections together must take us two hours. Adding the time already used (two hours) and the new time constraint ($\\frac{3}{2}$ hours) adds up to exactly three hours to complete the full ten mile trek at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Finally, let's quickly check if all numbers work out right. Had she simply kept a constant speed throughout of 4 mph, she would indeed finish the entire hike in three hours, having completed 12 miles. Therefore, attempting this problem with a constant speed of 4 mph proves successful. As such, any other method achieving an average speed of 4 mph over the course of three hours will also produce the correct answer. Because we already figured out the time taken was actually two and a half hours (and not just three hours), calculating the unknown speed using the equation above results in:$$\\text{unknown speed} = \\frac{\\text{remaining distance}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{6}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{6\\times2}{5} = \\frac{12}{5}=2.4.$$Thus, you see, no matter which approach you take, the required speed turns out to be 2.4 miles per hour! While disappointing to the hiker inside us all hoping for something round like 4 mph, it makes perfect sense that it doesn't work out so perfectly: after all, the second half of the journey isn't just the leftover six miles, but rather",
        " walk the next 2 miles so far, which means it takes her $$1+1=2$$hours to cover these 6 miles. Since the whole length of the path is 12 miles, if she desires an average speed of 4 miles/hour overall, $$\\frac{\\text{total length}}{\\text{average speed}} = \\frac{12}{4}=3.$$Thus, three hours would be needed for the whole trip. Therefore, the amount of time she needs available to complete the last 6 miles is simply $$3-2=\\boxed{1}$$ hour. Finally, since the distance she has left to cover is 6 miles, her required speed becomes $$\\frac{6}{1}=\\boxed{6}.$$So you or he must walk 6 mph over the final stretch. This type of thinking is related to the concept of average speed and requires us to consider the relationship between distance, rate, and time. It is important to remember that while average speed refers to the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, here our focus was upon the remaining distance requiring a specific walking speed to meet the desired average for the entire journey; as such, we calculated the time required to cover the remaining distance and used that information to determine the appropriate speed necessary!",
        " to hike is 12 miles and she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. So the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. This means she needs to walk these remaining 6 miles in the remaining time of 2 hours if she wants her overall average speed to remain constant at 4 mph. However, as calculated above, when starting off at only half current desired speed -- or equivalently, maintaining one fourth acceleration instead of full acceleration-- it takes twice amount of time , i.e., taking us up topresented calculation :$\\text { Time }=\\frac{\\text { Distance }}{\\text { Rate }}=\\frac{6}{4}=1.5$hours.\" href=\"https://brilliant.org/wiki/equation-solving/\">Equation Solving</a>, since you cannot have fractions of a unit (.5ofanhourmakesno sensefortime).</p><p style=\"color: ",

Since it takes her half an hour to cover these six miles ($t=\\frac{d}{r}$), if her goal is an average speed of 4 mph throughout the entire trip, the equation becomes: $$ r =\\frac{6}{\\frac{3}{2}} }= \\frac{6\\times2}{3}=4 .$$So although you may not expect it initially, setting the overall average speed helps us find a specific speed needed over the final leg of the journey as well. Alternatively, one could simply note that if she wants to average 4 mph over a total trip of 12 miles in 3 hours (2 hrs so far + half an hour more), she must cover the remaining 6 miles in half an hour, which is a speed of 12 mph..The answer is: 12",

Since she has already walked the first $6$ miles in $2$ hours, or $3$ mph, we can use the average speed formula: $$\\text{avg speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}}.$$ We want this to equal $4$.

Let\u2019s reevaluate the problem using algebra:. Total Distance / Average Speed = Total Time $$12mph / 4mph = 3 hrs.$$ To find the amount of time spent on each segment, we subtract the partial times from the total time. $$3hrs - 2hrs = 1 hr.$$ With one hour to walk the final 6 miles, the required speed becomes $6mi./1hr. = 6 mph.$ Something went wrong! It turns out that having an average of four miles per hour over three miles requires completing those three miles in just under half an hour, not one hour. By setting up the equation above as written, we actually doomed ourselves to failure from the start. A much easier (and realistic) approach is to realize that if Marissa wants an average of four miles per hour over twelve miles, and she has already walked six miles in two hours, then in order for the average to be four miles per hour, the remaining six miles must be covered in 1.5 hours, or at a speed of $\\frac{6}{1.5}=4$ miles per hour. Thus, instead of going through the steps above, simply calculate:$$\\frac{",
        " Marissa hiked $$12$$ miles all together through three hours as follows: initial four mile section which was covered off line rate one hour hence making it equivalent or $$4/1=4mph$$, followed by latter walking into other two state again within same time period i.e.,one hour thus resulting into similar rates of\u00a0$$\\frac{2}{1}=2miles\\/per\\:hour.$$ Together therefore these two distances traveled amount to $$\\left(\\frac{4+2}{1+1}\\right)\\mph=(6/2) \\mph\\Rightarrow3 mph .$$ Thus Balance Distance Allotted Time Let us assume that third portion involves covering say 'x' miles ,and further we let this last leg take 'y\" hours so that overall hike may yield average 4mph.

Careful inspection however reveals that somehow our initially estimated value for either 'xory failed to take care of the mandatory condition of 4mph successfully based on general mathematical theory expounded earlier saying a variable ( unknown value ) taken into account while computing an expected mean value must bring out an average figure equal to the actual observations itself marking presence of absence of mistake somewhere.In haste therefore to maintain the validity of current equation hastily multiplied 1/",

We know Marissa walked four miles in one hour so her walking rate was R=4 mph and similarly she hiked 2 miles in one hour making her rate R=2 mph. That means her current average speed is 6/3=2 mph. To get her average up to 4 mph we must get 12 / 3 = 4 mph as our target for all three legs of this journey. Thus out remaining unknown leg requires us to solve for S under the following equation: .

It was stated earlier that walking the First Four Miles took one hour; AND Walking Two More Miles also took One Hour; hence, the current T can equal FOUR hours ((1+1)=2). Next you simply take the length of the already completed portion of the trip (Four plus Two or Six Miles\u2026this could be called C currently), add however many more miles remain to reach the goal (One mile in this example because One Hundred Twenty minus Six equals Fifteen); set this expression aside: {=((C)+(M))=(6+15)=21}. You may recall the basic rate formula is R = D / T. Conversely, rearranging to solve for D (distance), we get D = R*T. Again looking ahead, if our target R (or rate) going forward were to be four miles/hour and we multiply this by the NEW T value of seven hours (since (4+?) = 7...as FOUR represents the three preceding hours walked), we see the magic number of 28 appear....(D=(4)*(7)=28)...the very distance calculated just moments ago when combining like terms {6+15}!

When we multiply both sides by $t$, we get:$$4 \\cdot {t} = 12.$$ And dividing both sides by ${4}$, we conclude that:$t = 3$. This tells us that the trip would take three hours. Remembering back to when Mrs. Tingle was asking about whether or not Mariah could make it to school in time, remember that you subtracted her travel thus far--the four miles in one hour plus the following two miles in another\u2013from the total distance and arrived at needing to traverse six more miles in one hour.

We went about this problem incorrectly. Forget about dividing up the 12 mile distance into four parts when we want to find out our rate or speed for the REMAINING distance. Instead focus on how to translate words into math and solve for a single unknown. We already figured out that within 2 hours she was able to cover 6 miles so if she wishes to average 4 mph overall, then in $(12 / 4)$ or 3 hours she must be able to cover 12 miles. Solving for our remaining distance we find: . Distance = Rate*Times so the Remaining Distance = 4 mph * 1.5 hours = 6 miles. That means we actually just solved for it. It was right in front of us. When going for a desired overall mph average you simply divide the total distance by the desired average yielding the total time required. Here a total distance of 12 mi. divided by a desired average of 4 mph yields a total time of 3 hrs.

Use the formula speed =distance /time to find the required mph for the remainder. $$\\frac{6}{1}=6$$So you need to walk the remaining distance at 6 mph.

Instead one must add the durations of time spent traveling each interval and calculate the total distance divided by this sum. Applying this correct method shows above calculations to be incorrect, prompting discovery of error while solving the problem twice demonstrates its validity.

Dividing through by 4 gets \\[\\frac{6}{4}=( { RD } / x ),\\]or simplifying, ${3}/{2}= ({RD}/x).$ Cross multiply to get rid of the fraction, thusly producing\\[(3/2)\\times x = RD,\\] or in other words, expressed with words, \\[1.5x=RD.\\] And remember what R D is; it\u2019s just what\u2019s left of our original 12 mile trek after we\u2019ve already walked 6... so it follows that Remaining Distance (RD), is \\(12-6\\), or \\(6\\) miles. Substituting this back into our latest equation would lead us to . $$1.5x=6$$ Solving Eqaution By itself, it may look a bit scary, but fear not because its a basic algebra problem. To solve Equation , divide both sides by \\(\\text{1.5}\\) : Since you divided by 1.5 on both sides, that means that whatever value you get for xx will make the statement true. Hence, if $$\\frac{1.5x}{1.5}=\\frac{6",
        " we eliminate the denominator and simplify our result to just 12=4(2+(r/x)). Expanding out right hand side term yields us simply : 12 = 8+ (4* r/x). Subtract eight from both sdies so as to isolate terms containing x variable on one side of equation ,we get :  4=(4r / X ) or 4X= 4R . Thus if R denotes Remaining Distance which currently unknown being equal to 12\u2212(first six)=12\u20136=6 miles obtained via simple arithmetic, plugging it into above formula results in 4\u2022x = 4\u20226 or equivalently 4x = 24 solve for x to obtain desired value sought quantity capital X equals twelve divided four namely ????",

Using basic algebra and taking the derivative of the linear function describing the remaining distance to be traveled at 3 mph would yield the instantaneous acceleration to get from 3 mph to 4 mph as the required 'r'. Doing so results in no change since the slope is constant...this is reassuring since we know we would expect the derivative of a linear function to be a constant! Therefore applying differentiation techniques to the equation y=mx+b when m is the constant slope of the line and b is the y-intercept will always produce the value equal to the slope.
