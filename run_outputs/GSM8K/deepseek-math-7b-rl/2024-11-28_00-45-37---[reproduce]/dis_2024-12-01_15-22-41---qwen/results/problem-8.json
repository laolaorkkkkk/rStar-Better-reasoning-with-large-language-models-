Following this clogged hour, John continues his homeward travel, spending half an hour traveling at a rate of 30 mph. Therefore, he moves forward a distance of .5*30=15miles. With this partial progress completed, John finally sets off again at highway speeds along a route providing access to 80 mph highways. Given these conditions, if it takes him another four minus three plus two (.i.e., full one hour jam)minushalf(.i.e..5hoursort30minutes),we knowimmediatelythatthislast legisitselfthreequartersofashotgunhellencounteredearlierinduringhisoutboundjourney.Soifduringthefirstlegofthissituationhecovereda distance of 180 miles, logically we can conclude the final phase of his return trip would cover 3/4 of 180 or 135 miles. Combining the five distinct distances calculated thusfar, namely 180(initialoutward boundprogress),zero(forstagnanttraffic)...plusanothersixandthirtyquarters!(orfifteen!)...plusonehundred thirtyfive(final homeward bound distance in excess of initial outward bound distance) yields us a net result of 180+0+15+135 =330 miles!

        " During all the standby times combined (which include stopping off due unforeseen circumstances), Mr Personel manages only covering slightly over one third or just less than three quarters as fast(or slower)than usual traveling speeds would normally indicate thus leaving even greater space/distance gaps open yet unfilled requiring extra effortful activity such attempts...",
        " lets find out said speed quickly.... Okay ,during QV=(0.5)(30) =>Q=15miles ;and thus our new value becomes V=(80)+15 or V=>95mph .Thus finally calculating backwards would leave us :(dtravelledwhilegetting\"stuck\") =(T @NewSpeed)-( T@initialtraffic)=((3hr@95mph)-((3-2)hr@the original forward speed)) OR even easier thought logically since its simple subtraction:- dleftbehind=-(-2@-60)=-[+(2\u221760)]=+120m Ie he leaves behind another 120 mile postive displacement as if someone kicked him 120 miles down the road taking him completely off coursefrom where hes been heading instead onto a detour which only compounds his predicament!. From above calculation it can also easily deduced the car traveled ((3x95)-(1\u00d760))=285\u221260 ie 225 miles leaving himself stranded exactlywhere all that work put him; obviously thats not possible either cuz hes gotta be somewhere right?! Well let me help clarify where using basic high school physics principles (+common sense :) ). Remember that opposite forces effect such as pushing a rock uphill will cause one to move slowly compared to if you simply dropped the rock off the cliff example moves faster due to gravity pulling it down forcefully whereas holding it back with your hand prevents the full potential energy of the rocks mass to be released hence resultingin less accelerationoverall than if say dropping the rock OFF thecliff!(ie.u start off with two identical objects one lifted high above ground then allowed to fall versus simply drop one from same height yet which falls quicker?).Applyingthis concepttoabove problem..

At this point we know nothing about any further advancements or regressions so let\u2019s move along; afterwards though it might help conceptually to imagine restarting from this point temporally but spatially at homebase again readyto head back outwards\u2026 During the hourlong period of stop-go traffic progression seems nil leading us to conclude that progression thusfar amounts solely to reduction due entirely to stalling(*). Therefore our current situationis onewherewe have traveled 180milesbutare only \u2018standing there\u2019 in real terms having effectively reduced that initial 180 mile lead over our destination down to zero(!) Base equation therefore is simple: what he drove away from the house initially (180 miles), minus what little actual drive time left he was able to accomplish during the remainder of his allotted timeframe.(In other words ifthestatedproblemwere instead asking How Far Away did he finally get from the Homethe correctmathwouldstillyouknowalready\u2026180\u2013[progressduringremainingdrive]) From here it's just doing the math--ahem\u2014substituting numbers into the base formula.

That comes to: 1.5*80=120 miles...So now your base equation is shaping up to look like this=>180\u2013(15+120)= ? Remember that you began with 180 miles away, and then subtracted away (15+120) representing the miles erased off that 180 equivalent through stalling & the actually accomplished driving during the second halfof the allotted four homemaking hoursrespectively. Now just solve that: The ( ) = 135 so the equation reads 180\u2013135 = 45 miles away from home as your final answer !(*) Of course in reality a combination of both actual spatialreductionandactualspatialadvancementmayhavesituatedoccurred during whichever set of stopped / go periods.

Of that hour though, 2 hours (or really any portion greater than 0) is spent standing still due to traffic. This leaves him precisely .5 of an hour to cover the rest of the way home. Going at 30 mph for half an hour nets him 30/2 = 15 miles made up ground along the homeward route. Finally, traveling at 80 MPH out for the last .5 hour results in 80*.5=<<80*0.5=40>>40 miles traveled while returning. Adding everything together; Ground covered while driving away from home + Change in ground coverage as result of turning around + Driving toward home under new conditions = Total Distance from Home. 180 - 180 + 15+40= <<180-180+15+40=55>>55 Miles.",

        " When he turned back, he was already this far along plus whatever else happens since then until finally reaching his house or wherever it is (in relation to him) when we want to know 'how far'. We can say therefore that what follows is 'added onto' 180 miles; either making it further from his house (+), or bringing him closer (-). From here on though, I will use d=rt [distance equals rate times time] as micro-equations, instead of writing out 'miles' each time. Also note that whenever I add or subtract numbers, I am referring to these mini-distances and if I pretend that the distances accumulate, like an odometer, in order to find out 'How Far?', that would be my final consideration at the end. Lastly, sometimes the direction doesn't really matter in these problems, so I simply will be adding (-) or subtracting (+) distances rather than labels ('away from', 'towards'). Okay, moving right along...(you can stop following along at this point if you wish.)He tries to get home in another four hours. First, during which he spent two whole hours sitting still with nothing doing. Well,  0 miles are traveled during that time: d=rt --> d=0*2 --> d=0That leaves him with 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 remaining hours during which he travels. This second portion of his travel is broken into three parts: the first half hour when he drove at thirty miles an hour; the next undefined length of time (or amount of time) whe he drove at regular speed (regular = 80 mph); and lastly, the well-defined 1 hour left when he might have driven, but we won't count that because we don't know how fast he was driving. During the first half hour (30 min = .5 hr), traveling at 30 mph, he covers:d=.5*30-->d=15During the rest of that time (the other remaining 1.5 hours), he travels at 80 mph, so d=1.5*80-->d=120And thusly summing up all those distances, whether towards the house or away from it, however you choose to conceptualize it,Total Distance Away From Home=(Initial)+(During Standstill)+(While Travelling At 30 MPH)+(Remaining Time @ Regular Speed)=180+0+15+120=",

This means our running total remains static during these four hours; however, since you said only the second part was relevant when answering your last problem I shall continue through the rest anyway...He then attempts to make up for this delay by zooming off at 30 mph -- doing this for half an hour nets him a move of .5*30 = 15 miles. Finally moving at 80 mph for the remainder of the four hour period, which leaves us with 4 - 3(driving out) - 2(standstill) - 0.5 (accelerating) = -0.5 hours or half an hour not including the standstill! Since we know how many hours he drove at what speed and therefore how far he moved, we combine this information: Moving at 80 mph for half an hour equates to a move of 40 miles (.5*80). Combining like terms across the top and bottom lines respectively: Distance covered = Initial (outward bound leg) minus return (sitting still), plus accelerating leg (+15), plus final dash (-half an hour of driving @80mph) legs; or: 180 - 180 +15+40=55miles.

His initial gain of 180 minus his current loss due to backing up while stopped at the toll booth plus what little bit progress was made driving slow under the interstate bridge prior to resuming highway speeds again all adding together like such; 180 -(2+15+80)= 180-(115)=65 miles as their difference yields him only having traveled shortfall of just six-fifths of a car length shy of making it backhome yet AGAIN!",

Finally we know he traveled for the last 1.5 (@80 MPH) = 1.5*80 = <<1.5*80=120>>120 miles. Therefore ,we need only add his initial mileage, which can be determined by multiplying the first three hours by the 60MPH, or 180 miles altogether (+/-recovery trip)=3hours*60MPH = 180(+/-trip back) +-120(trafficloss)+-15(.5hr@30MPH)+-120 (final leg@80) =answer...in this case; solving by addition 180+-120+-15+-120=......180-255=-75 Miles. To check our work, remember that you can always solve via the distance formula D=RT. We know what T is (3+2+.5+1=7), and we know the Final velocity used (80), so if D=7*80 = 560...also accounting for previous losses as it subtracts an additional 120+15+120 >>>>>>560-255=305miles minimum loss off the original 180 mile head start & ~~~~recalculating~~~~180-305=-125miles....which clearly indicates an error somewhere. Returning to our earlier equation (~180+-120+-15+-120) ...clearly showed a negative value when adding integers together incorrectly, resulting in further complications later, eventually leading us to look for an alternative route using PEMDAS and other fundamental calculations along with definitions to finally come to a conclusion!(-75 doesn't make sense either!). Let take a different approach utilizing proper mathematic operations providing a more plausible outcome moving forward While recognizing certain shortfalls associated with such operations namely multiplication precedes addition/subtraction operations according to PEMDAS principals governing basic arithmetic procedures while evaluating algebraic expressions containing parenthesis exponential terms multiplication division addition subtraction steps respectively from",

This sucks big time ! Big as wide open spaces !! A space the size of Texas !!! But never fear buddy, read on for promising signs ahead ... Next our intrepid traveler veers off in the direction of Big Al's auto supply shop who agrees to let him use their wireless vehicle locating device system at a price of only 0.5$. It takes them just barely long enough to connect said locator beacon into his brand new GPS unit AND make the initial fix for where he thinks he ought to be in reference to said home based at approximately 289.67 miles away!!! Finally Mr. Roadrunner feels comfortable and happy knowing where HIS HOMEYHOE IS! Fast forward.......our hero continues onward down the road full of promise at a steady clip of.....wait for it..........80 MPH!!!!!! His perseverance and patience finally pays off as he covers ground at a reasonable pace determined to get back Home Sweet Homeo!! And lets figure out how Far Along He Gets: First we take the last remaining leg of his journey which happens to come in at an even 2 hours of driving time since it took him two hours of awful frustration fighting through gridlock circling around aimless trying to find a way thru all that nonsense. Multiply that 2 hours by his speed of 80mph and we see a distance achieved of 2*80 equaling 160 miles traveled during those last couple of hours whizzing past the scenery outward towards wherever his loving mother might dwell. IF one were to merely ADD these two distances together : 160+289.67 one ends up with a sum of ..............449.67 miles separating driver from homieeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As a note i believe this question assumes several things; sidequests involving a human style decision process regarding whether to continue on a certain path or change directions midstream ;whether to accept help from others",
        " towards his starting point when he realized what was forgotten earlier i.e., all distances travelled since turning would need to be subtracted from initial travel as per mathematical convention. That takes him another $$4\\text{hours}\u2212(2+\\frac{1}{2})\\text{hours}=1.\\overline{5}\\text{hours},$$during which three periods may be discerned: $$\\bullet$$in still standing traffic ($\\mathbf{2}$ hrs) at zero speed ($0$ mph), therefore no distance covered;$$\\bullet$$a slow down phase due to standing traffic obstruction($\\frac{1}{2}$ hour )at $30$ mph therefore covering $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15$;and finally,$$ \\bullet $$normal driving at freeway speed thereafter $(1.\\overline{5}-0.5 = 1)$ hr @ $80$ mph,covering another $$1\u00d780=80.$$Thus,\\[D_{total}= D_{initial} - D_{turnaround}\\]\\[=(180)-(2(0)+0.5(30)+1(80))\\]\\[=180-(0+15+80)=180-95\\]Finally \\[D_{fromhome}:=|180-95|=85.\\]So it stands that Mr.Home Impersonator who initially drove away into the sunset only ended up having just come within ninty-five(!) miles short of homelanding!",
        " since we are looking specifically for how far it was from the starting position at any given moment. Therefore ignore turn around - assume all following journeys were in one direction! Next stage takes him 4 hours but spend the first hour stuck in trafic jam i.e actual travel time reduced to just 2hrs .At this rate therefore ,2hours*speed(60mph)=120miles further along road before meeting with stranded vehicle ahead etc...Then comes another \u00bd hr stuck again..which adds no further meaningful info as stated above; finally remaining 'proper'travel time is 4total hrs minus initial 3hr stuck phase less half hour delay= 4-(3+0.5)=0.5 hours.This last part seems trivial mathematically speaking but forces us into realizing that if no other information was specified about what might otherwise happen to the traveller (e.g.: getting stranded again etc.), then we would consider it travelling at constant speed for duration quoted! Thus use remaining time period (0.5)* its speed(80mph)=40milesawayfromhomewhen calculation ceases due to lack additional data points ...
