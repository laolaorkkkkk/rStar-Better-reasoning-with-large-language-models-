Simple interest does not include any interest earned on interest. Compound interest means you are charged interest on your initial balance (the principal) AND the interest that has been added to your balance so far. Basically, it\u2019s like adding interest to your interest. You earn interest on your initial deposit (the principal), but you also earn interest on the previously earned interest. To calculate either type of interest, you\u2019ll need to know the principal (initial balance), the annual interest rate (usually expressed as a percentage), the number of compounding periods per year, and the number of years. Key differences Between Simple vs Compounded InterestSimple interest Compound interest Calculation Principal x Rate x Time Principal x (1 + Rate)^Time Applied only to the principal Amount accrued increases linearly over time Amount accrued grows exponentially over time Typically paid out at the end of the period Typically paid out periodically during the term Applies to loans and mortgages An investment product may push you into a higher tax bracket An investment product cannot force you to sell at a specific point Types Things to consider when comparing rates Calculate the Annual Percentage Yield APY using the formula below.[((1 + Interest Rate/Number of compounding periods) ^ (Number of compounding periods)) - 1 ] multiplied by 100 % Also known as Effective Annual Rate EAR Formula Considerations Read full article here Once you worked those details out.....Having Determined Per Year Rates.......Its just another series of equations .....In case U forgot",
