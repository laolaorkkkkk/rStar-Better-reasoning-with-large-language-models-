We know Claire eats 3 eggs per day which means over four weeks our new problem becomes...how many eggs would she eat if she consumed three per day for forty days because remember, a week contains 7 days and we want 4 weeks, thus four weeks would contain 4*7=4*7=28 days but we made a mistake in our logic when going from 'weeks' to 'days', there actually only are 4 weeks being talked about (as opposed to any arbitrary number of weeks), the number of days in question then would be simply 4*7=4*7=28 days not 7*4=(7)*4=28 days ... oops, I accidentally made another common mistake, my apologies :p Anyway, back to solving our problem; okay so Claire eats 3 eggs per day and we figured out there are 4 weeks, well if a week typically has 7 days right..then surely 4 weeks would have 4*7=4*7=28 days ....if we multiply those together (the number of eggs eaten per day times the total number of days) we can find the TOTAL NUMBER OF EGGS CONSUMED: $$N_{\\text{Total Eggs}} = N_{\\text{eggs/day}} \\cdot N_{\\text{days}}=3\\;\\text{eggs/day} \\cdot 28\\;\\text{days}=84 \\;\\text{eggs}.$$ However this is asking for the solution in terms of a dozen eggs (since 1 dozen equals 12 things, in this case things are eggs)...

Therefore, within those same four weeks Claire uses up exactly six dozen chicken eggs!",
        " or 3\u00d7 28 cookies altogether during those four weeks. That means you multiply 3 times 28 which equals --->  3*28=84 <-- /eggs eaten in all four weeks long! However we aren't asked to list out how many exact individual eggs this quantity represents but rather how many dozens it constitutes. Knowing that one dozen contains twelve units, divide your previously obtained value of 84 divided into 12 parts so as to find out what number of dozens correspond to exactly this amount -->  $\\frac{84}{12}=7$ . Therefore Claires uses up <<84/12=7>>seven dozens of eggs when making thrice baked oatmeals daily routine over span of four weeks./",

        " Clare uses daily. We know this value as well which is 3 per serving. To figure out how may servings make up one dozen take the definition of a dozen eggs--which is 12\u2014and divide it by the defined number of eggs used per meal. Therefore 12\u00f73=4 meals in one dozen. Next multiply these results together according the following equation: Number of dozens = (Number of eggs eaten) /(Number of eggspermeal )/ (",
