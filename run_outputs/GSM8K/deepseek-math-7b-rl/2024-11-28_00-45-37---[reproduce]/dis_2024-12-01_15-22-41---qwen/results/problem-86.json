        " sum therefore, this sequence amounts to 4+12+6=22 alarms going off (the correct answer). Let us confirm this result using basic math skills instead. First we know that every ringing lasts three units of time--thus the first alarm rang four times, or 4*3 = 12units; the second alarm rang for 3*4 = 12 units worth of rings (three times as longas the first); while the third ringing only rang for .5*12 = 6 units (only half as long asthe second). Sum these together and you get 12+12+6 = 30 units of ringing --a contradiction since clearly the bell cannot possibly have rung thirty times! Something has gone awry. What went wrong here? Upon revisualizing our work above closely,we noticed that indeed the problem stipulated that the clock rung\"THREE TIMES A DAY AS REMINDER.\"In retrospect however the intended reading of this stipulation might perhaps betterhave been interpreted not additively but multiplicatively -- i.e. if the alarmranged three times a day as reminder, it rang three times per day, PER DAYunrelated to the actual ringing of the alarm clock per se. Underthis assumption, on the first go the clock would ring three times, on thesecond 3*3 = 9 times, and on the third 3*(1/2) = 1.5 times (each ringinglasting one-half as long as the second). Summing these up we get 3+9+1.5 =13.5 individual ringings, which tallies perfectly with common sense: thealarm simply can't go off 13.5 times, let alone 30 times!Given this correction, the question therefore reduces to adding thrice thenumberof units per ringing, over three days. Since each ringing lasts three un-its, then on the first day the clock rang 3*3 = 9 units; on the second dayit rang 3*3 = 9 units; and on the third day it rang 3*.5 = 1.5 unitstogether amounting to a total of 9+9+1.5 =27.5 unitsacross threedayswhen the factor of three was interpreted multiplicatively.

        " next part which asks about when the third alarm sounded; if the last one only rang for half as long again (compared to what just happened), well then obviously you could find out exactly how many times it rang simply by cutting that previous amount ($\\text{previous} = 12$)in half or dividing by $\\text{two}$, thusly $(12/2)=6$. And adding those six alarms into your growing grand total brings us up to $(\\text{{total sofar}}=(16)+6=\\boxed{22}$ ringing sounds!",
        " move onto figuring out the other alarms. We know if one alarm rings once, its length of ringing equals what was stated earlier (in this case 4). Therefore when considering lengths...if something says 'three times longer', multiply the original amount by three etc..the second alarm sounded like it rang for three times 4 which equals 12. Finally our last alarm would ring halfway the soundlength of the middle alarm; so if you halve/divide 12 into 6, your alarm sounds went up 6. To find out the sum simply add together these amounts! Which makes them equal to :4+12+6= 22",
