Each time when he goes to sleep afterwards and starts reading, it lasts him half the amount of time than what he spent watching tv so that means its going to last (2/2) or just 1 hour. Again since we know he repeats doing these activities three times weekly....so therefore spending 1*3 equals 3hours every week while sleeping and starting to read immediately following his viewing session(after taking break). To find out how mucches he would need during four weeKS... all you woudl basically do next iS Multiply Both your Weekly Numbers together ... meaning; 4 Weeks : ((6 Hours Per Week)+ (3Hours PerWeek))*4 Weeks . This translates into (9)*4= 36 Hours over the course of Four Weeks!",

Therefore adding together both activities , Weekly consumption stands at six hours plus three additional hrs meaning Total Hours Per Week TOTAL = 9hrs!

From here, simple multiplication tells us that jim spent 6Weeksto watch television during these past few months... which implies we multiply those weekly values against 'four', so figure out it was really just basic math involving fractionsfrom earlier! Just because you might not always see words like\"halfaslongorhalftime,\" doesn't mean these types of problems won't appear on tests either; sometimes things get tricky quick depending what type topic being discussed material wise deals within particular discipline(s)...but don't worry too much--there shouldn't pose huge challenges once practice session gets underway again down below next bit :)",
