        " goal was set at 2000 but so far this day you only took in 1800 calories (not bad), therefore it means all you need to take up as food to meet your quota is 2000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1800 = 200 calories . Determine how many servings correspond to those extra 200 calories needed based on the nutrition information provided earlier stating 1 serving equates to exactly 250 cal . To find out HOW MANY SERVINGS OF CHIPS make UTAKE IN TOTAL CALORIESOF 200 just divide the required number of calories into the amount of calories in ONE serving; That is Shown mathematically below: Number Of Required Calories / Number Of Calories Per Serving = Number Of Servings Needed. Thus, translates to : 200 \u00c3\u00b7 250 = 0.8 servingsOf ChipsNeededto reach or exceed ur daily requirement .. As You Have A whole Bag At Hand Which Contains Exactly FIVE S V I N G E R s iT Means Its Okay Because Half Or 0.8 Are Made Up From Those Available Five Vs which amounts g to roughly One Packet Worth Twenty Grams(id est) because half of 5 equals Is point eight approximately esq to one packet offtwentygrms!",

From this we know several things\u2026one, it means we could consume ALMOST A WHOLE BAG WEEKS WORTH Of chips based upon todays measured caloric intake while still hitting our macros without even trying because guess what next week your activity level might change slightly requiring recalculation thus forcing you TO CHANGE UNITS OR MACROS IN ORDER TO ADJUST!. Additionally having over eaten suggests perhaps expanding carbohydrate content rather than going low carb so therefore focusing less fat overall instead deciding upon keeping fats lower whilst raising carbs accordingly would help reach goals quicker since starting points may vary widely according individual lifestyles etc., which requires knowledge base pertaining specific bodybuilding experience versus health related conditions affecting various organs internally among others outside environment presenting myriad variables leading into decision making processes when creating meal plans designed fit respective requirements catered towards optimal performance levels resulting directly proportional increases success outcomes achieved throughout year",

        " because we subtracted wrong !! corrected calculation below ... (sorry bout dat) Remaining Daily Allowance=Daily Target\u2212Consumed =(2000)-1800=>200 You need to figure out how manyservingsthat is. Since one portion of our potato chips has 250 calories, and the person wants to stay within a 200-calorie allowance, the number of servings is: (200 cal / 250 cal/serving) = 0.8 serv Since one serving of chips is half a portion, you can only have 4 bags of chips (2 portions). Alternatively, since 1 serving is 50g (300 g / 6 servings), then the number of grams you can have is 200g (0.8* 250g/serving). ",
        " Since it contains 250 calories per serving times 5 servings or (250)*(5) equals 1250 calories . With our target being around 2000cal while having taken in only 1800 so far this means we might still take another ((2000)-(1800))or just 200 This leaves us needing more information regarding portion size as when dividing 200 result into 'the unknown variable' which represents gram weight yields indefiniteness {200/(unknown)}. However since no other variables seem any different than what was provided earlier lets solve rather blindly [200=x*(250/300)] using a shortcut (rather than cross multiplication). By commonsense alone one would know multiplying something by a fraction less than one yields a strictly smaller result thus intuitively speaking the answer should be less than 3 ounces . Lets see what alculus yields [(200)=(x)*((250)/300)] ---> x =(200*300)/(250)= 240grams Well thats nice but considering my previous statement about not going over roughly three ounces based off instinct alone I feel pretty good knowing my calculation is close especially considering the amount saved by doing the calculation invovling division instead of cross multiplication",

This yields \u2800\u2800\u2800bags allowed = (allowable) / (bag) = 200 / 1250 = .16 or \u215bth Therefore it stands to reason you could only have eight bags of potato chips! However upon further inspection we realize that obviously cannot possibly be true as having food like this can lead easily too quickly towards obesity symptoms so clearly Calculation One above needs adjustment It seems likely either someone filled in the wrong numbers or messed up doing their math But let\u2019s try another approach To best determine appropriate portion size first take into account starting caloric intake allowance ie; say for argument sake you took in only half that amount Which would mean consumption=target /2 That means you consumed 2000/2=1000 At 250 cals per serve that allows you to partake in...=>portionSizeAllowedInGrams =(consumption )/(cals/serve)=1000/250 =4 serv A third alternative By sheer logic As everyone knows that \u00bd a bag won\u2019t cut it You might want to see what going for half a bag would look like And in terms of calories\u2026since 5 servings make a whole bag (and thus 2.5 would be half) We know that\u2026 (servings) x (calories/serving) = Total calories (2.5) x (250) = 625 meaning absolutely no problem whatsoever Consuming just under half a bag whilst working toward your set goal Hey presto Problem solved All agree Something amiss here Clearly all three methods utilized yield wildly disparate results With Method Order ",
