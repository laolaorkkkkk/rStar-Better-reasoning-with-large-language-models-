But wait....the problem actually tells us even more specific things concerning how age of phones compares among these three individuals. It states first that Brandons phone ages four times faster/as fast than Ben's phone. That statement indicates multiplication, not addition nor subtraction but rather multiplication!! And further solidifying our calculations if Ben's Iphone was indeed found to be 2 years old; if brandon's iphone aged four times what ben's did, its age could be determined through multiplying Ben's age by 4 . As such Brandon's age can be calculated like so : $4\\times2$. To find out whether Brandon still owns a smartphone legal enough to use according to current laws , let's calculate.....to discover...that ...brandons cellphone is in fact 8years old!.That news may shock you but in real life scenarios sometimes very old objects can still meet required legal standards and therefore be considered usable smartphones legally speaking.So while initially calculating six multiplied by three might seem daunting due huge sums created,(remember Khan academy has tools specifically built for large numbers?)

Substituting $S = 1$, lets us solve for B according to $B = 2\\cdot 1$. Thusly speaking either approach gets us to the same conclusion:$B = 2.$ Following this result around to find out how old brandon's phone is (\"Brandons's iPhone is...four times\" as old as bennett'...), another simple multiplication gives $4 \\times 2 = 8 $.
