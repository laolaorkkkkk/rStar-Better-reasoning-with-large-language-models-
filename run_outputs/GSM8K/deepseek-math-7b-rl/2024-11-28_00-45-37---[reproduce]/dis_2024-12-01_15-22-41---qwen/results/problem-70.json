Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(\\sqrt{3}/4) \\times (1)^2 = \\sqrt{3}/4$, and similarly the area of $\\triangle BCD$ is also equal to $\\sqrt{3}/4$. To find the area of quadrilateral ABCD, we add up these two smaller equilateral triangles' areas so our sum is $(\\sqrt{3}/4)+(\\sqrt{3}/4)=\\sqrt{3}/2 $. But it seems like you may still need further explanation as people sometimes get confused about why adding those two equivalent triangles result in taking half of one whole equilateral triangle . Here goes: Let s=the side length of any one of the three larger equilateral triangles. Area of any one large triangle based upon the given information would equal ($\\sqrt{3}/4$)x(s)^2 or A1=($\\sqrt{3}/4)(s^2)$. Breaking all three of the larger equilateral triangles into two of the smaller congruent triangles each with area =($\\sqrt{3}/4)(s/2)^2$ results in Area T=3(area of a small triangle)=3(($\\sqrt{3}/4)(s/2)^2) =($\\sqrt{3}/4)(3s^2/4)= ($\\sqrt{3}/4)(s^2)*3/4=$A1x(3/4). Clearly the combined area of the three larger triangles without splitting them into two smaller triangles equals A1 or ($\\sqrt{3}/4)(s^2)$. We know that this area is the same as the area of the large equilateral triangle composed of three smaller ones, namely ($\\sqrt{3}/4)(3s^2)$, only if the height of that large equilateral triangle is actually sqrt(3)/2 times the height of each of the three smaller triangles with side lengths of s/2 units . This can only happen if the basic building block of the larger equilateral triangle is itself an equilateral triangle with side lengths of s units thus proving my point above. Judy teaches 5 dance classes Monday through Friday, making 5*15= <<5*15=75>>75 dollars a day. Saturdays she takes 8*15$=<<8*15=120>>120$dollars From Sunday through Saturday she makes a total",

This makes sense because \u03c0 radians correspond to half a rotation--from say 0 to \u03c0 or \u03c0 to 2\u03c0 --and when we multiply those \u03c0 units by 2 we get a full 2\u03c0 radians!
