        " figure out just how many ice cream cartons Cynthia needs because if she eats one everyday it means over 60 days she'll eat   (the little 'x' stands for multiplication)    . This translates into       or six whole blocks of ice cream. It doesn't make sense to buy fractions of an ice cream block so let\u2019s see what happens when you round up to the next whole number of ice cream cartons which would mean buying seven instead of six since she cant purchase partials of things unless its flour perhaps but not ice cream! That makes us want Tu price tag accordingly as well right guys....let me write those steps down please don' t get mad at me...ok here goes nothing!!! First multiply 1day/per\u00b760days=total number eaten dinners neededwhich equals sixtybecause obviously multiplying any number by ONE leaves it unchanged under these circumstances).Now take this sixty divide it \u00f7(division symbol)servings /carton , getting approximately ~ four point oh zero--if rounded towards nearest tenth place after carrying out division operation ..however according tot eh question prompter guidelines directions restrictions etc..we must consider only whole numbers therefore follow through further calculations involving cents portion removal via rounding off processes resulting i nvalue equalling exactly{after removing fractional parts} integer value equalto :five meaning Cynthia would need FIVE entire Cartons Of Ice Cream eventually priced away at ($)(Five multiplied times four BuckS)= TwentyYIeF Dollars post big red arrow indeed!!",

Okay\u2026now assuming you actually needed FOUR containers instead of just a few extra ones for waste or spillage etc.. We next multiply these 4 boxes times the price of ONE box ($4).
