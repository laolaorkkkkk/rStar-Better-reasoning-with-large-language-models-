Nonetheless one little mistake leads to way too much work otherwise.

Substituting numbers immediately renders us with new usefulequation:$$\u00a3195=(x*\u00a315)-((8*$20)+\u00a35)$$Immediately cancelling out member terms across either side simplifies entire expression considerably further down path towards answering actual question because less variables to dealwith $$\\Rightarrow \u00a3195 =(\u00a315x)-\u00a3165 .$$ Moving constants around yields following equation:$$\u00a3195+\u00a3165=\u00a315x \\Rightarrow \u00a3360=\u00a315x.$$. Divide fifteen on both sides finally solves for X:$$X:=\\frac{\u00a3360}{\u00a315} =24.$$ Diving by 15 indeed leaves integer 24 alone which actually corresponds nicely with numberof original legos john had because :if 13 of those lead directly toworthousands of pounds worth of goldsources therefore implying that despite differentcontext altogether interesting result could possibly arise meaningthat outcome",

        " used this money to buy 8 video games for $20 each, which was a total cost of 8 * $20 = $160. This means he spent $160 out of his earnings of $195, leaving him with $195 - $160 = $35 remaining. However, we know that actually he only had $5 remaining as stated in the problem. Therefore our assumption about selling the legos seems incorrect because it would result in too much money being left over ($35 instead of just $5). Let's try another approach... We know that he ended up having exactly $5 left. That means when subtracting what he paid for video games (which costs $160) from his original amount before anything was sold or purchased -- let's call this X-- results in us getting precisely $5 like shown below: $$X\u2212$160=$5$$ To find 'X', add '$160' to both sides making your equation look like:$$x=160+5$, meaning the value you want, denoted by 'X,' equals $165$. But remember 'X' represents JOHN'S ORIGINAL TOY SALE MONEY! And since john earned this money through selling LEGOS (at $15 per set), then all you need to do NOW is divide that amount into the total of $165 to figure OUT HOW MANY LEGO SETS HE SOLD FIRST.... Ie:$165 \u00f7 $15= 11.$ As such; initially John had 13 Lego sets but needed to sell off 11 first in order to account for earning $165 AND THEN SPENDING $160 WHILE HAVING ONLY $5 LEFT IN THE END!.

However we know this amount equals exactly what was leftover ($5), therefore our calculation thus far seems correct. Since I mentioned earlier than you don\u2019t want any negative amounts anywhere in your work or calculations (because numbers can get complicated quickly) when dealing w/amount o money received / spent etc always make sure your math leads to a positive ending amount!

We know these \u00a330 represent twelve entire legos because when you divide their combined price before being sold($30 ) per individual Lego(which costs exactly @$15 ), You get eleven;therefore ,he only gets three extra ones!

However since this problem didn\u2019t specify anything but whole amounts we can assume Jhon couldn\u2019t afford another half block even if it meant overpaying slightly...so based off logic alone, as no other reasonable conclusions follow regarding fractional/decimal quantities ,the best possible conclusion one could make based only off of mathematical results(in which the only unreasonable result is \u201csomething less than zero\u201d due to him running out of money before finishing his purchaseso obviously something went wrong).

Solving this gets us $195-160=35$, but we want to know how many legos john has remaining. At first you had 13 Lego Sets which seems odd because the question asks \"how many Lego sets\", not \"how many Legos\". Nonetheless if he sold n legos, obviously he would have $13-n$ legos remaining! Okay let's go back to the problem now... We already calculated out right side of our equation as being equal to 35; therefore $195-160= Leftover Money$, simplifying the above gets $195 - 160 = 35$, thus verifying our math. Therefore we know that $195-160=Leftover Money$, or $35=Leftover Money.$ Since the leftover money was also stated to be worth 5 dollars we know that we must have solved our equation correctly!. Finally solving for n (the amount of legos Sold) we get that $13-n=(numberofremaininglego)$. From previous work we determined that when John sold his n legos they amounted to $$(numberoflegoSold)\\cdot (sale price)=n\\cdot 15.$$ Hopefully this makes sense so far. Remember we also know that $$\\text{total money from selling} - \\text{total money used} = \\text{leftover money}.$$ Substituting the left and right sides gives  $$13\\cdot 15-(8\\cdot20)=5,$$ And calculating the left hand side gives   $$195 - 160=35 .$$ This tells us that indeed  \\[5=Left Over money.\\]To finish up we need to find how maney legos remain ($13-n$).
