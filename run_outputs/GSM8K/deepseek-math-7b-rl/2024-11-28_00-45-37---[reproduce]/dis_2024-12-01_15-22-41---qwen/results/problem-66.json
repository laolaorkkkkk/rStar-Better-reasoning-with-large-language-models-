Furthermore, since everyone who participates includes coaches too, having exactly three persons per school making up these coaching roles including both male or female students doesn't change anything when it gets down to adding everything together provided you remember not double count any person because those individuals only get counted once during addition process even if each individual showing up multiple time within calculation setup seems like something else. Therefore finishing off problem solution would require taking previous sum obtained ($40) plus another contribution coming via inclusion principle represented here through multiplication operation namely involving multiplying value received prior( i.e.,$40 )times additional entity affecting overall summation figure ((there exist threecoachperteam); thusly resulting product looks $(3x4)$).

        " $( )$. According to our computation rules, we perform operations inside parentheses before anything else. Hence as a next step, it would make sense to evaluate what expression was inside said parentheses. This leads us back again to needing to take care of division prior to carrying out any addition or subtraction movements which further illustrates why multiplication & division should be completed before addition & subtraction. Going strictly in order from left to right, evaluation begins like so: First, $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$, Division: We see that if we start from the left, performing the operation(s) in order, firstly you divide six by two giving three. Doing this substitution, yields new expression: \\[ \\underset{\\frac{6}{2}=3}{3+2}+1 \\] Moving onto Addition: Looking at this new expression, we can easily deduce the order of operations, namely carry out the addition next because it falls under the category of Addition. Performing this calculation gives: $$ (3+2)+1= 5+1.$$ At this point, only one more arithmetic operation is needed to arrive at the solution to this equation. That being the addition itself. Adding 5 and 1 together gives: $$5+1=6$$ Thus, solving the original problem by following the order of operations correctly, results in the value of 6 when the expression $6\\div2(1+2)$ is evaluated.

Additionally, each school also sends 2 coaches for each team, which would mean 2 * 2 = 4 coaches are being sent overall because there are two teams per school and each gets its own set of coaches. Multiply this number times the number of schools to find out how many coaches have been sent: 4*4=16. To get the grand total of participants, we add together these numbers: 40+16=56 Therefore,.",
        " coach for each team. Since there are two teams per school and each team needs one coach, this means each school sends 2 coaches. Again, since there are four schools participating, the total number of coaches sent is 4 * 2 = 8 coaches. To find out the overall number of people all of the schools have sent, you simply add together the total number of players and the total number of coaches; therefore it would be calculated as follows : Total People = Number of Players+NumberofCoaches Therefore TP = 40+8 i.e., solving further ,TP = 48 Thus all oftheschools combined havesenta total of forty eight menintothetournament",

Additionally, each team has a coach, so each school also sends 2 coaches. This means each school sends a total of 10+2 = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players sent is 10*4 = 40, and the total number of coaches sent is 2*4 = 8. Adding these together, we find that there are 40+8 = 48 people in total who have been sent from the 4 schools. Therefore, both methods used above yielded correct results; namely, method A showed directly that the sum was equal to forty eight while Method B provided verification through another approach which also proved it true",

Over all the 4 schools this gives us 4*12=48 persons. As already explained, the alternative way of thinking leads to the same result. Therefore both yields identical responses which confirm our calculations",
