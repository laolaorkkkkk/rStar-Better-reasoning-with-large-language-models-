Therefore, since the melting rate equals 2 cm/hour and the candle burnt for four hours, its decrease would equal 4*2=8 cm . This means all candles regardless their original length would become 8cm shorter after burning through those four hours.So obviously any size(as long as initially intact )candle ending upburning entirelythroughwould meanit becomes zero centimeter tall after such four hourly burn period, while halfsizeonebecoming less than half would shrink correspondingly.",

Therefore when you take off all melted parts down till ground level versus initial top point before starting burn period; You see just only {L} minus{the shrinkage occurred}, hence L-{shrunk}= Initial Length-(Initial Height Shrunk During Burn Period), which simplifies nicely initially being written simply numerically e.g.: Of say fifty centimeter long stick ; Fifty Minus Eight Yields Forty Two CM Left\u2026!As calculated above!.

To find out exactly how short the candle became after such a long burn, just perform this calculation: $$4 \\text{ (hours) }*2\\text { (centimeters/hour)}=8$$That means during those four hours, the candle shrank by 8 cm. Therefore our last operation would look like $$\\text{Initial Length}\u20138=x.$$However, since no specific initial length was provided, we can simply express the new length as$$\\text{\"the original length of the candle minus }8 \\text{.\"}$$.So what if someone asked you what expression could represent the height of the candle after these 4 hours? Well, even though we don\u2019t know the starting height, we can still write an expression:$$\\text{(starting height)}\u2212(4\u00d72)$$.This might seem a bit strange because we aren\u2019t providing a numerical answer, but when you actually solve algebra problems, this sort of expression is very common! Be sure not to worry about that! Your turn to shine! Look at the following problem: A car travels 3 miles per gallon of gasoline, and the car's fuel tank can hold 15 gallons of gasoline. How many miles can the car travel on a full tank of gasoline?To figure this one out, you simply multiply the number of gallons of gasoline the tank holds by the number of miles per gallon that the car achieves.In other words, take 3 miles/gallon times 15 gallons, which equals $\\boxed{45}$.Therefore, any time your problem involves taking measures of one thing and applying them to another thing, multiplication likely will be the operation needed to solve the question.For instance, if you're trying to determine the distance traveled based on speed and time, you use the formula d=rt , or distance equals rate multiplied by time . Similarly, finding the area of a rectangle requires multiplying the width by the length.And while adding and subtracting may sometimes also be used to solve story problems, often those operations are related to comparing or combining quantities rather than applying one quantity to another.When solving word problems involving percentages, such as \"finding what percentage\" or \"what percent of,\" remember that the word \"of\" translates to multiplication.Similarly, saying \"express a value as a percent of another value\" simply means dividing the first value by the second value and expressing that quotient as a percentage.Multiplication therefore will almost always be the correct operation when dealing with problems relating to",

Another way you could calculate this problem would be simply multiplying your rate (the number of minutes melted per minute) -- here our rate happens to already be in terms of whole numbers so we didn't have to worry about conversion issues--times the total elapsed time (\"four\" or \"forty something\") instead of breaking up the calculation into steps involving addition and multiplication operations separately; but either method works fine!
