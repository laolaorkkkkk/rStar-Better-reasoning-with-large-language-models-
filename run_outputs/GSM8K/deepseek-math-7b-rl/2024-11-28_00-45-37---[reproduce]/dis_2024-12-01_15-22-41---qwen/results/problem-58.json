When multiplying something by a percentage it needs first to be turned into a decimal. That\u2019s done by taking 25 / 100 equaling .25 Multiply .$40 X .25 and your product comes to $.10 Next apply this dollar figure to Steve's base cost as instructed by adding them together.$40+.10=$41 This brings us to STEP TWO! We already established early on that Stephens had a further uncalculated bill tacked onto his recent cost of $3 bringing his cost to:$41+$3=$44 It\u2019s important not to forget about this next part as it is often miscalculated\u2026..that being the generous tip of $4 To finalize things just add the last bit information gained to existing figure.$44+$4=$48 Your final solution......but wait didn\u2019t the question ask for the FULL price INCLUDING EVERYTHING???? Don\u2019t forget to include the original grocery bill!!!! $48+$40=FULL PRICE INCLUSING EVERY THINGS OR $88"
