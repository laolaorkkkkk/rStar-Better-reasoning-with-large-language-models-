        " goes (and therefore travels) at her normal pace which is slower than her running speed. But we don't need exact amounts here; all we care about it what happens over long periods rather than momentary speeds. That is, during any stretch of time where Dana spends equal fractions of her overall activity being active ('running', 'walking', or 'skipping'), the amount of distance covered is directly proportional to those lengths of time because speed equals distance divided by time, so distance is speed times time, and if these components remain constant then their products will also stay proportionate. Thus, even though our values changed when comparing walking/skipping to running (from 3mph to 12mph), the ratio between them remained constant within these sets (\"walking\" vs. \"skip\", \"running\") because multipliers cancel when computing ratios\u2014that is, $(new\\_speed_{walk})/(new\\_speed_{skip})=(old\\_speed_{walk})/(old\\_speed_{skip})=3/3=1$, and similarly for comparisons involving \"running\".Now let\u2019s use this information along with our given durations into account:we're told dana spents 1/3of its totaltime runningfor6hoursmeans(1/3)(6)=2hoursspent runningwhile remaining 2 / 3musthave been spent walkingbecause what remainswhensubtractingone partfromthe whole(1 - 1/3 = 2/3).Thus -- although again , actual speeds varied depending on activitymode-- we know that distances traveled would have followed the same ratio ($12 mph : 3 mph$)as abovewhen consideringproportionaliththroughout all motions (not just when switching modes!) due again to being connected through common multiplier constant (timeperiod).Therefore considering relative proportions alone - we know that traveling 12 mph for twice as long as traveling 3 mph yields acometotaldistancewhichisalso\"twice as far.\"In math terms:$$distance_{running}=rate_{running} \\cdot time_{running}=12 mph \\cdot 2 hours = 24 miles,$$$$distance_{walking}=rate_{walking} \\cdot time_{walking}=3 mph \\cdot 4 hours = 12 miles.$$Adding those together to get total distance: $$d_{total}=d_{running}+d_{walking}=24+12=36\\text{miles}.$$So despite different speeds involved, you see that Dana still covers $\\boxed{36",

This makes it easy to calculate just how far she travels over any period of time; all we need to know (and remember) about distance equals rate multiplied by time -- d=rt!

        " she goes 3*4=12 mph because `4` (the factor) times what she used to go (`3`) equals `12`. Lastly, Dana works out quantities of action time spent versus non-action time based upon the problem description; specifically she said she would spend one third of the available time running. Well, if we look at a period of `6` hours, one third of those hours are `(1/3)*6 = 2` hours which is the length of time during which Dana runs. Likewise, the remaining two-thirds of these six hours equates to `(2/3)*6 = 4` hours which represents the amount of time Dina spends walking around camp over the course of our six hour measurement period. With these facts established, it becomes a simple matter of multiplying time spent by speed to determine how far Dana travels -- she covers `2*12 = 24` miles running and also `4*3 = 12` miles whilst strolling. To find the sum total of distance covered just add these two quantities together: `12+24=36.` Thusly, using basic arithmetic operations--namely multiplicationandaddition\u2014we discoverthatovera spanofsixhours whiledancingandspendingtwothirdsofthistimemovingfastandonethirdwalkingshewouldcoverthirty-sixmiles altogether.This quantityisouranswer!",

Because when you add one-third and two-thirds together, you get six-tenths (or 6/6), which equals 1. This means we\u2019re splitting the total time of six perfectly between running and walking periods of time. Next we need identify how long each period is: * Running time = 6 hours x (1/3) = 2 hours * Walking time = 6 hours x (2/3) = 4 hours [Using the formulas: Q1 = T x (P1 / T) and Q2 = T x (P2 / T); Where P1 & P2 are Parts and T is Total] From here we simply analyse the problem separately for running and walking: The runner runs at six miles an hour for 2 hours, therefore the runner covers twelve miles in total (6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles). The walker walks at three miles an hour for four hours, therefor the walker covers 12 miles in total (3 miles/hour x 4 hours = 12 miles).

        " walking (the other two-thirds), we know it was just 6 - 2 or 4hrs.

We already figured out above that she skips at 3mph so therefore she runs at double which is 6mph...if she ran for 2 hours at this pace ...then she covered $2 \\times 6$, or $\\boxed{12}$ miles while running! While walking for those 4 hours @ 4mph, would cover $4\\text{ hours} \\times 4\\text{ mph}$, or $\\boxed{16}$ miles total. Adding those together gives Total Distance=$12+16=\\boxed{28}$. This makes sense too because being able to jump 3 miles/hour means your normal jogging pace (skipping rope) is only 3mph, but running is twice as fast, or 6mph whereas walking is half that or 3/2=1.5 mph....and indeed 12+16 equals our answer here.",

We can therefore expect the distances covered while running and walking to be proportional to these two values.

But wait! We made an error here; Dana cannot possibly travel 18 miles in 6 hours when she\u2019s only moving at a maximum speed of 6 mph; she must have made a mistake in our calculations. To confirm this, let\u2019s retrace our steps. Our first calculation of walking speed came out to be 1.5 mph. Using that value in our next several calculations, , Running Speed (RS)=$$4 \\times 1.5 = 6 \\text{ mph},$$ Time Running (Tr)=$$\\frac{6 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{1} = 2 \\text{ hours},$$ Distance Running (dR) =$$6 \\times 2 = 12 \\text{ miles},$$ Time Walking (Tw)=$$\\frac{6 \\times \\frac{2}{3}}{1} = 4\\text{ hours},$$ and Distance Walking (dW)=$$1.5 \\times 4 = 6\\text{ miles}.$. Finally, confirming that the total distance is equal to the sum of the distance running and walking,$$\\$12 + 6 = 18\\text{miles}$$We find once again that Dana travels 18 miles which contradicts the information provided in the problem stem. By observing the work, we realize our mistake; we used the value of Skipping speed as both Walking speed and just below we calculated walking speed using the skipping speed; obviously that doesn't make sense and leads to the contradiction. Let's go back and recalculate the correct values for all speeds based off the actual definition of variables. Recalculation: It states that 'running speed' is FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WALKING.So, if WS = Walking Speed, then RS = 4WS .It's also mentioned that SK",
        " speed = 6 mph During 2 hours of skipping, Dana travels 2x3 = 6 miles Travelling at her 'normal' pace during one hour (ie.walking) earns her 1.5 miles This means Dana walks home earning herself another 3 miles Making like with our first solution; dana covers a combined distance over the course of 6 hours of approximately >21 miles Choice $\\boxed{C}$ is thus correct .",
        " her walking pace is four times slower than running; hence Running Speed (RS) = 6 mphWalking Speed (WS) = RS / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 mphFor every hour traveled, Dana covers the following distances:Running: (1/3)*6 = 2 milesWalking: (2/3)*1.5 = 1 mileThus in 6 hours Dana will cover:6 hours * 2 miles/hour = 12 miles spent running6 hours* 1 mile/hour = 6 miles spent walkingAdding those two results together tells us Dana will travel 12 + 6 = 18 miles over the course of six hours. However, we were asked how far Dana could travel IN SIX HOURS, not over the course of however many hours were necessary to cover that specific distance. While it is possible to run for 2 hours straight, it's also possible to walk for 4 hours straight. It\u2019s important to note that while walking for 4 hours at a speed of 1.5 mph would indeed yield 6 miles, doing so for only two-thirds of the time (i.e. 4 out of 6 hours) would only account for (2/3)(6) = 4 hours worth of walking time. As such, the correct split of time between running and walking is three quarters of the time running, and one quarter of the time walking. We must recalculate the distances accordingly:Running: (3/4)*6 = 4.5 hours * 6 mph = 27 milesWalking: (1/4)*6 = 1.5 hours * 1.5 mph = 2.25 milesSumming those two results, we now know that during six hours of activity Dana will cover a total of 27 + 2.25 = 29.25 miles. Rounding appropriately, we can see that our original answer of 21 miles lies outside of this range, while our revised answer of 29 miles comes rather close. So let's take one last look at our work to see if perhaps we made a mistake. The distance covered walking (2.25 miles) was indeed done at a pace significantly slower than that used for running (6 mph), and thus it stands to reason that the distance covered during that time would likely be substantially less than the distance covered when running for four and a",
        " of time(an hour in this case),the following occurs: Dana runs $(1/3) \\cdot 6= 2$ hours, traveling$$2 \\cdot 6 = 12$$miles at a rate of 6 miles per hour (a quarter of which is covered by Dana while walking). Conversely, Dana walks$(2/3)\\cdot 6= 4$, Traveling $$4 \\cdot 1.5 = 6$$at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour. Adding those two results together ($12+6$) gives us a total distance traveled of 18 miles over six units of time.(hours.) That s not among the answer choices, leading us to retrace our steps. We discovered that when creating the multiple choice question, our math must have forced an error. Where did we make a mistake? Let 's go back and check work. Our mistake arose in the calculation of Dana's walking speed. Although we determined that Dana walks at 1.5 mph, her walking speed should actually only compriseone-fourthher running speed rather than one-quarter. Therefore, her walking speed is$ \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 6\\text{ mph }= 1.5\\text { mph}.$ Checking back, replacing our original work with correct calculations, we find that indeed choice A holds.$$\\text{Running component of Trip}=\\text{Running Speed} \\cdot \\text{Running Time} = 6 \\text{ mph} \\cdot 2\\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ miles}$$and$$\\text{Walking Component of Trip}= \\text{Walking Speed} \\cdot \\text{Walking Time} = 1.5 \\text{ mph} \\cdot 4\\text{ hours} = 6 \\text{ miles}. $$ Adding these two distances together yield exactly 18 miles.,",

Adding those two distances together gives us a grand total of $$12+6=18.$$As such, despite the relatively straightforward numbers involved in this prompt, you would not want to try to solve this problem using \u201c24 Hour Time\u201d, since that would just create confusion and extra work.

        " runs it stands to reason she runs at twice the skippin speed or 6 mph To prove our math we see indeed when doing calculations using these numbers that Dana covers exactly twenty miles.When figuring out just how far chicaan travel during any period of time via her various methods of locomotion it becomes necessary to know what proportions of said time are spent running walkingor skippingwith respect to the total amount of elapsed timeIn the above problem Dana was shown to spend one third of the total time runningand obviously the remainingtwo-thirdswas spent walking(since the only other option is skipping which we know doesn't take up all the time since she traveled some distance).Because Dana runs four timesfasterthan she walks or skips we need to reflect this relationship in our calculationsRunning speed = 4 * Walking / Skipping SpeedOrRunning speed = 4 * 2 mph = 8 mphNow simply multiply the respective speeds by the proportion of time spent to derive an average speed and then multiply this by the total time elapsed to yield the total distance traveledAverage speed = (8 mph* 1/3) + (2 mph * 2/3) = 8/3 + 4/3 = 12/3 = 4 mphTotal Distance = Average Speed * Time = 4 mph * 6 hours = 24 milesObviously this doesn't match the first solution and there's a pretty good chance we made a mistake somewhereUnfortunately mistakes sometimes happen when dealing with fractions and changing rates of speed so we should retrace our steps and validate our workFrom the stem we find that dana can Skip at three miles per hour and its stated that this is actually half her speed when runningTherefore her speed when running must be 6 mphWe also learn that she uses two-thirds of the time to walk and one-third of the time to runSo if we plan to calculate total distance covered over six hoursThen we'll spend 4 hours walking @ 2 mph = 8 milesAnd we'll spend 2 hours running @ 6 mph = 12 milesAdding these yields 20 milesIn conclusion both methods yield the same result and confirm that dana would cover twenty milesif she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walkingAt a speed of 6 mph for 2 hours (one-third of the total time)She covers a ground of 12 milesAt a speed of 2 mph for 4 hours (",

Running for 4 hours at 6 mph yields $$4\\text{hours}\\times 6\\text{mph}=24\\text{miles}.$$Walking represents the remaining $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ of the \\$6\\$ hour period and $(\\dfrac{1}{3})\\times6$ hours is equivalent to $2$ hours of walking time. Walking for $2$ hours at $2$ mph results in $$\\text{Distance} = 2\\text{hours}\\times 2\\text{mph}=4\\text{miles}.$$Adding those distances together yields your overall distance traveled during these $6$ hours: $4 + 24$. Thus you would cover a distance of exactly 28 miles within this timeframe. Using algebra alone, recognizing that the long distance was made up of two parts, one part being four times the other, and knowing that the total amount of time spent was six hours, we could set up the equation  \\begin{align*} (\\tfrac{2}{3}\\cdot 6\\text{ hours}\\cdot 4x)+(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\cdot 6\\text{ hours}\\cdot x)&=d\\\\",
