        " since 3/4 of these units are occupied (or filled), this means $(3/4) \\times 120 = 90$ apartments are ocupied`. Therefore, `unocuppied` apartamentos amount to $$=Total\\text{ }units-Occupied$$ or simply speaking it\u2019ll yield us what exactly you want here! We just plug our calculated values into its equation which yields \\[ Total\\text{ Unoccupied Units} = 120 - 90 \\] It follows immediately that Richard currently rents out only $\\boxed{30}$ homes within their complex when searching them through using simple arithmetic operations like subtraction .",
        " subtracting those who live here means you get your answer by doing $total\\,number-\\,occupied,\\,units$, or rather $\\,120\\text{--}90=30 $. This tells us there are thirty people living outside! That\u2019s it!.",
        " follows; Total Units \u2013 Occupied Units = Unoccupied Units , or $120 - 90 = 30$, making 30units unoccupied throughout the building",
