Alright lets break down why\u2026 When dealing with word problems ask yourself: Do I understand the problem? Yes. Does my setup result in the correct units? No. Is my equation set up correctly? No. Looking back we realized that subtracting the max damage was the incorrect approach as the question wanted to know exactly how far beyond the dragons destructive radius would slaying the dragon occur based off various distances through variables such asm and n rather than comparing one fixed point(the DragonsReach) against another static quantity like TotalDamage..

        " range of Polly's throws correctly ($1200$) but we compared it to the minimum damage threshold of the Dragon (only $1000$), instead of the actual reach of its breath (also $1000$). Our equation should be set up as follows: MaximumThrow >= DamageThresholdofDragon <= ReachtoDragon. To solve for ReachToDragon, we take the maximum throw of $1200$ and subtract the safe threshold of the dragon of $1000$: $Reach_{to Dragon} = Throw_{max} - Dragon's\\ Threshold = 1200 ft - 1000ft = 200 ft$. Therefore, despite throwing further without the gemstone, using any benefit of the stone would actually bring Polly closer to being able to hit the dragon since including it adds an extra $800ft$ to the range versus just adding another $200ft$, because once you exceed the dragons reach, danger nears exponentially.",

        " but we weren't careful about what exactly was being compared. When comparing whether someone hits the target or not, landing inside the range of attack is good and landing outside that range is bad\u2014which makes our comparison wrong! The correct comparison would go like this: MaximumDistanceAllowed > ActualThrowingDistance (so as long as Polly throws the javelin less than or equal to the 1200 ft mark she stands safely away from the dragon). Given those changes our new equation becomes : MaximumDistanceAllowed \u2013 ActualThrowingDistance >= 0. Again plugging in numbers we get: 1000 - 1200 >= 0. From here, if we apply the same logic about negatives and positives as before: because this statement isn't true (-200 is NOT greater OR equal to zero), Polly won't make it. However Physics doesn't deal in fuzzy terms like maybe or kindof\u2026or .So let's revise the math until it works. Instead of subtracting the damage values, lets divide one by the other: MaximumDistanceAllowed/ActualThrowingDistance = SafetyFactor. Doing the calculation we find: 1000 / 1200 = 5/6ths which is clearly LESS THAN 1...a safety factor below 1 indicates dangerous! What went wrong?...the phrasing of our question above. It wasn't asking \"how close\"...it asked HOW FAR OUTSIDE OF THE REACH POINT CAN SHE STAND AND STILL HIT HER TARGET!. To solve this problem you need considerin' factors instead of just doing one arithmetical operation. Here's what I mean: firstly remember that although your calculations showed you couldn't be morethan '200ft' awayfrom the monster its obvious that saying ''can't bemorethan\" 200 feet away misleadingly implies that Polly might be able to hitteno' 200feetaway....maybe even closer!! A better wayto word thingsmight read:\"At most how close...\", signifying that indeedonecould calculate 'exactly how close', but certainly not by subtracting these twodistances(as that seemed to suggest)...again...we went awry because of the wording, not because of the actual math used.
