        " that Lee used to be able to run the same race two seconds faster than Gerald, this means that $$L=G-2.$$ We also see that if Gerald changes his diet, his new time, let's call it $\\text{New}_G$, is equal to $$\\text{New}_G= G \\times .9,$$ since his speed increased by 10%. Given that Lee still runs the hurdles in 38 seconds under these conditions (i.e., when Lee is running the hurdles 2 seconds faster than New_G), we therefore have \\[ L = 38 \\] and so substituting $L=G-2$ into this equation gives us \\[G-2=38\\] or simply \\[G=40.\\] Therefore, before improving his diet, Gerald was capable of running the 400-meter hurdles in forty seconds. Knowing this, we find out how fast Gerald can run with his improved diet by calculating $.9(40)$, because of course his speed increases by 10%.\\[$.9(40) = 36$\\]. Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the four hundred meter hurdle in 36 seconds.",
        " when Gerald doesn't change his diet, $L= G+2$. We also know (from the problem) that if Lee still runs the hurdles in 38 seconds, $L=38$, so substituting into our first equation allows us to say $$ L=G+2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 38=G+2.$$ Solving for $G$ requires subtracting two seconds from both sides of the equation above--which leaves you with $\\boxed{36}$ seconds as the amount of time it took Gerald to run the hurdles before making dietary changes. And finally, since increasing one's speed by 10% corresponds to multiplying ones' time by 0.9 (see previous problems), running the hurdle 400m race at .9 times your old speed ($36\\text{seconds}\\times .9$) lets you calculate that $$\\text{Improved Speed}=36\\times .9=\\boxed{32.4}$$ However, it seems unlikely that someone could actually run a 400-meter hurdle race in less than a whole second! Did you notice that small mistake right away? It turns out that despite what my final answer shows, I misread the problem. When the question said 'how fast', it meant 'what is Gerald's new best time', not 'what is Gerald's time if he somehow magically loses two seconds.' As such, we needed to find 90% of Gerald's old time, not subtract two seconds from Lee's time. Although I've edited the final result of my solution above to reflect this, you might want to take a moment to reconsider this problem from the beginning and work out the correct answer (taking into account whether or not people can actually run a 400 meter hurdle race in half a second!).",

Well, we previously established that whatever amount of improvement Gerald experienced shows up as a proportional decrease of .1=.1=10% when we multiply his old speed, namely 40 seconds, by .1., Our calculation above told us that Gerald used to take 40 seconds to complete the course, so the length of time he takes with his improved diet must be 40seconds\u2212(.1\u00d740seconds)=40seconds\u22124seconds=36seconds. That result wasn\u2019t among the answer choices provided, so we made a mistake! Let\u2019s try a different strategy. First, notice that while we don\u2019t know exactly what value G formerly had, we do know that its value was 2 seconds greater than the value of L, and thus in particular that G was 2 seconds greater than 38 seconds, making G=38+2=40\u00a0secondsold Gerald\u2019s speed.)

Since our most recent calculation, though, was correct: It really was the case that with his improved diet, Gerald would have taken 44 seconds to complete the race However, upon revisiting the problem statement, we see that we misunderstood the question: While it\u2019s true that often in such problem",

Since lee ran this same distance only 2 seconds slower or algebraically expressed L= G+2; therefore if it takes Lee 38 seconds to complete the entire event (L), you plug 38 into the equation so as to solve for the amount of time it took Gerald to compete the season: plugging values in yields =>  38=G+2 ; subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation yields=> 36=G , Therefore before improving dietary standards, Gerald completed the race in 36seconds .However since performance increased by ten percent through improved meal plan one can calculate his times via multipying the decimal form of 10% (.1)to find the increase in tim eand summing up the original value (oldgeraldtime )of thirty six seconds :(i.e(+.1)(36)=3.6(+36)=39.6); however such seems impossible thus indicating multiplication may not yield desired resultsperhaps squaring the value instead of multiplying:( i.e(.1)^2 (36)=0.1^2=0.01x 36=0.36; adding upgraded gerald time of 36 seconds to newly calculated increase in time (.36)we get36+.36=36.36which still doesn`t make sense.

We simply take Geralds regular time and add those couple of extra seconds to it: g+2=L That lets us replace every occurrence of L (lee's time) with g+2 in equation A.... What good does that do you ask? Well, look below; As you can see, this simplification almost magically creates an easy equation to solve for g. Almost! We still have to simplify the right side of the equation. To do this, remember that when you divide something by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal: Or in simpler language, you multiply the number by the upside down version of the fraction. Here .9 means the same as 9/10 so the upside down version is 10/9\u2014which is the way to multiply: Multiply both sides by ten & nine. This simplifies the Right Hand Side very nicely indeed: All those nasty fractions disappear completely and we're just left with plain ole GERALD on one side of the equals sign And on the other side we have\u2026.. Just Gerald multiplied by nine tenths Looking pretty simple doesn't it? Well here comes the fun part. You want to find out how fast Gerald is now, don't you? Well, if RegularGerald times 9/10 equals NewGerald...then to find NewGerald you just have to multiply RegularGerald times 9/10 Let's assume RegularGerald's time is called 'g'. Therefore,... NewGerald=(9/10)*g Look familiar? Of course it does. It's just the algebra translation of what we already knew about their speeds being related. Remember above how we said that NewGerald just happens to be Gerald at a time when he'd gotten 10 percent faster? Eh, who's keeping track anymore? This is math and rules are made to be broken around here for the most part! Cool, so far we figured out that , but since we also know lee's current time is equal to g plus two AND ALSOequalsto(9/10)*gwe can set those two equations equal to each other. I realize that was a mouth full. Let me try to explain again: We found that lee's current time (= g+2 )alsoequalsNewGerald (= (9/10)*g ). They're really the same thing, just different ways of writing down the same value. Ok, so",
        " to him since it says so directly above!. Knowing both their times individually allows us find exactly (accurately) how much better off Gerald is through his dietary change,. We simply subtract newer minus old for gerald:. That said however much better off GERALD may be based on percentages rather than raw numbers matters still . Based on 10%, multiply its former pace multiplied by 1+.1(disregarding negative value as time cannot be negative):. This translates as follows when you plug in 40 s into equation A'. Subtract accordingly leaving just 'Y': Solving leaves you with your solution!",
        " identify what it means when we say something improves its speed by X percent. Well, if someone's speed changes by a certain percentage, it means you're adding that percent of the value to the original value. So if I run my 400 meter hurdles in 40 seconds and improve my speed by 10%, that means I add 10% of 40 to 40. We find this as follows (notice the word 'of'): 10% * 40 = .1 * 40 = 4 And so our new time becomes 40+4=44 seconds That was before Lee got better though; remember that part about him being able to run those hurdles exactly two SECONDS FASTER THAN GERALD! Remembering that, all we need to do know is take away TWO from whatever time we calculated forgeraldwith his new improved time Since we found that geraldwas running the 400 meters in 44seconds after improving his diet THAT time would make leerun it in 44 - 2 = 42 seconds However neither 42 or 44 seconds match any of our possible answers. This seems to indicate that perhaps our first calculation must be wrong. Let's try again. When one says an increase of x percent, it means multiplying the base value by (1 + x/100). Therefore, if Gerald's speed increases by 10%, his new speed would be(1 + 10/100) times his old speed. Rather than multiply everything out, notice that adding 1 to a decimal is the same as moving the decimal point one place to the right. Hence, replacing the percent sign/% with '/100',we rewrite 1 + 10/100as 1.1.ThusGerald's new speed would be 1.1times his old speed. Okay, well let's go back to that sentence about leebeing twosecondsfasterthan Gerald:.This meansLeeperformedthe racein 40 - 2 = 38 secondswithhisold speed.,and therefore GideonPerformedthe whole thing in 38 / 1.1 = 34.something seven lots because division is just repeated subtraction.
