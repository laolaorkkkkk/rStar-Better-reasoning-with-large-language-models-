When dividing, don\u2019t forget divide both the dollar sign (\\$) and the actual number (19.50/ .25), which yields:\\[X\\:=\\dfrac{\\$19.50}{.25}\\:=\\$78.\\]This result actually makes sense based on the problem context. With a 25% discount applied to the original price yielding a final sale price of \\$19.50, the original price must have been higher (to account for the discount); thus a value of \\$78 seems reasonable. However, even though the algebraic setup was solid, it didn\u2019t answer the specific question that was asked. That is, find the Original Price of the Book rather than the unknown variable 'x'. While you rightly solved for X, that it turns out equals \\$78, hence the original price of the book being \\$78 isn't exactly what was sought. It turns out the key aspect of this problem, if approached properly, is conceptual understanding and estimation skills afforded by careful analysis of the problem itself. By analyzing the fact that Kyle received a 25% discount on the original price and paid \\$19.50, you realize that the extra 25%, or \\$4.50 represented the discount. Therefore, the original price must have been approximately double the final sale price, arriving at:\\[\\text{Original Price} = 2*\\text{Final Sale Price}= 2*\\ \\$19.50 = \\$39.\\]. But looking back once more at your algebra work, notice that subtracting 25% from 100% leaves 75%. And if we let P equal the original price, we can write an equation:\\[0.75P=19.50 \\Rightarrow P=\\dfrac{\\$19.50}{.75}=\\$26.\\]It appears as thought you forgot to multiply by the 100% when converting the decimal to percent (as in turning .75 into 75%).

You take whatever your current value is times one minus your discount percentage. And that equals what you currently have. So if right now I pay $19.50 but that\u2019s only 75 percent of the price because I get a 25 percent discount, if I wanted to figure out what the original price or original quantity was, it would be equal to $19.5 divided by 0.75 which indeed equals $26.",

Simplifying it further would result into `(75/100) Original Price = $19.50`, which simplifies down to `0.75* Original Price = $19.50.` To find out what one unit represents we divide both sides by .75 so `$19.50 / .75` yields $\\$26$.

Please note that while solving problems like these it helps to work conceptually rather than numerically whenever possible.. Knowing what you want to find (the original price) allows us to set up an algebraic equation based off of the problem description. By representing the unknown original price as a variable x ,we created an equation involving known quantities ($19.5$, $25\\%$ ). Solving that equation unambiguously revealed the value of x .
