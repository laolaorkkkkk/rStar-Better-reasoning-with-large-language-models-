        " know these repairs raised the value of the house by 150%, or multiply its base value (the original purchase price before improvements). A 150% increase means adding back triple the initial amount (or multiplying by 4 because '100%' of something is just the thing itself plus '150%' of the thing, which is three times the thing), but since this question states explicitly that all values only apply to the original pre-repair $80,000 basis, we can simply take 150% of $80,000 ---> 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000; therefore raising the market value to $80,000+120,000= $$200,000$'. To find out what kind of financial return you made through such endeavor we subtract your initial investment from that resulting figure [market value($200,000)]\u2014initial investment ($130,000)].

Finally, subtracting the amount of money spent to get this return yields any profit realized, or simply sale value minus cost: $$\\text{profit}= V_{new}-\\text{total cost} = 200,\\!000-130,\\!000=\\boxed{70,000}$$ Thus, Joshua made a net income/profit equal to $70K once everything was said and done.",

Therefore if our current Worth/(Initial Amount+$Increase)=New Worth ,then New Worth=(Original Amount+Additional Increase)=(One Hundred % + One hundred Fifty%/One hundred%)* Original Worth =(Two Hundreds Fifty / One Hundred)* Initial Amount=Three hundreds Fifty Percentof Initial Amount=.
