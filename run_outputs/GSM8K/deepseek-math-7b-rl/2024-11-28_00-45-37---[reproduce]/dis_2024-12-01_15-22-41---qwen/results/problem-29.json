Ok never mind..:P anyway back to the problem let us set up an easy simple equation beginning with knowing quantities : Knowing 1 Pair of High Heels is priced at $33 whilst the second pair was double that price therefore being $66 ; totaling such value summed would bring about : $33 + $66 = $99 ..and This Amount happens to ALSO be LESS 5 DOLLARS compared to the price of the pricey Boots..So setting UP an Equation : BOOTS PRICE MINUS $99 EQUALS ONLY 5 DOLLARS thus it looks like this : B - $99 = $5 solve for b thus add 99 Dollars on both sides of the equation : B- $99 + $99 = $5 + $99 B= $104 YESSSS!!!!

However, to eliminate the possibility of choosing either answer A or B, let's check them anyway just to make sure: if A was the correct answer, then the pair of pricey hi-heels would have to equal $104, but since the pricey pair simply cost 2x the cheaper one, and the cheap pair was already given as costing $33, then the pricey pair would have to cost 2*$33 = only $66; this combination would add up to only $131 between both pairs, way too low (<$104) to equal the amount of the boot price (X). If J was the correct answer, then the same logic would hold true and we would end up with a combined pair of hi-heels costing only $131 which is again too low (<$131) to equal X.
