To find out how many animals you have in your town (R), take the sum of all dog owners and cat owners (`60+120`) and subtract only one time the number 12 because it says 'twelve less', so make sure not to double count the minus 12 when doing calculation. This means: `(60+120) - 12=` R equals `180-12`, which simplifies to R = 168 Therefore, there are three types of animal owners living in this area: 168 rabbit owners; 120 cat owners, and 60 dog owners making for a grand total of 348 pet owners!",
