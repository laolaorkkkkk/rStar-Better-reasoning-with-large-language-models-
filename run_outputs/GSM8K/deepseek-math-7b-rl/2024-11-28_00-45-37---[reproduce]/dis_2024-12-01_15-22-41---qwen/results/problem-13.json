Well, if you look back upon my work you would see that eventually using these steps I got 36 meaning that previously I used bad math somewhere along those lines :-). To correct myself let me walk you through the process again only this time use numbers embedded in words: Suppose X represents the unknown quantity of merchandise supplied to market by the vendor. According to specific question, Vendor sells X/3 out of his stuff over at Green House. Plus Two Red Rock souvenir from the Red House and decided to split the remainder (X - [X/3 + 2]) evenly between his Orange and Gray customers. If you take into consideration the entire system, we come up with equation of the form:$$\\cfrac{X-\\left(\\dfrac{X}{3}+2\\right)}{2}=5.$$After removing the parentheses and combining similar terms in the numerator,$$\\cfrac{X-\\dfrac{X}{3}-2}{2}=5.$$Get rid of the fraction developmentally speaking, multiply all terms by 3 keeping in mind to distribute into numerator of the fraction.$$ \\cfrac{3X-X-6}{2}=5.$$Simplify the numerator",

That yields simply, $$x = 24.$$. Thus if Melanie initially had twenty four vacuum cleaners, everything else falls into place quite nicely. First sell off $\\frac{24}{3}$, or eight units for the green house. Add the additional two brought in from the red house, and then apply these results to the subsequent sale of half the remainder ($(\\frac{(24+6)}{3}) /2$) resulting in five, the number of vacuums that remained.
