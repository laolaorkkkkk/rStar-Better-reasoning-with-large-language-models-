From this calculation it becomes clear that indeed because a truck has so many more tyres than a auto ($60 compared to $40) doing what looks like the best course of action would be to change all the autos first (since 1*60 > 4*40). Moving onto Friday,the mechanic doesn\u2019t repair any truck tires which means zero points,but makes double todays amount from ONLY fixing Car Tyres (12*$40=$480 according to the question/problem itself).Calculating differences,(Highest Revenue)-(Lowest Revenue)=($480-$520=$-40), meaning that even though friday saw triple the amount of truns ($12 vs Thursday\u2019s \u201conly\u201d 4 @ ratio 3:1) in terms of absolute integers Friday actually resulted in $-40 less than Thursday\u2019s $520.From this comparison the problem/question can therefore be verified as correct in saying thursday seeing the highest Revenues followed by Friday being lowest.

        " with it right away! Moving along swiftly we need next figure out how much $$ was earned on friday Given that no truck tires were repaired, all 12 were car tires which were fixed at $40 each, totaling to 12 \u00d7 $40= $480 Not bad eh!? This amount ($480) turned out indeed to be greater compared to the sum obtained when calculating earnings incurred during Thursday thereby meaningin other words Wednesday Is factually Higher!!

        " *40=160 meaning in total we made 360+160=520 dollars. Whereas On friday ,we serviced only 12 cars *40=480 which was our total earnings for the day ; Since 480 > 520 The difference between the two amounts generated is calculated as thus ; Difference in earnings =(480\u2013520) OR $( 40). It stands proven that engaging in servicing CARS indeed generates more REVEnue than attempting to service TRUCKS .Given the information above can change your mind! Your steps show me I was wrong . To find out which day has a higher revenueto start off with looking at both Truck & Car details for each day. THURSDAY: T=6, C=4 FRIEDAY: T= 0, C=12 By comparing the above mentioned activity, its clear that on Friday the mechanics are servicing more car doors, hence the higher revenue since the rate is lesser compared to the ratesetting a lower benchmark on Fridays activity to beat.. Next calculate the revenue.. THURSDAY: For Trucks @ $60 : T*6=T*$60 = 360 For Cars @ $40 : C*4 =C*$40 = 160 Total on THURSDAY = T+C = 360+160= $520 From FRIDAY : For Trucks @ $60 : T*0 = 0 For Cars @ $40 : C*12 = C*$40 = 480 Total on Saturday = T+C = 0+480= $480 Therefore compare the totals..clearly THURSDAY shows a higher Revenue ..Difference =Thursday rev. - Friday rev.= 520-480 = $40 Let ' s get back to business Consider the following question HARD CHOICE TEST QUESTION A coffee manufacturer sells a coffee that costs $8.00per pound.

Moving onto business operations carried out on Friday; if no truck tyres are repaired, hence zero sales via truck tyre service,then we only calculate based on car tier services. Since he was able to carry out 12 repairs during the course of friday,the calculation is made simple considering one parameter, which is the number of car tyres repaired on friday(12) multiplied through by the fixed cost to repair a car tyre($40). We can represent this mathematically like this 12*$40=$480 represents the total revenues realised on Friday From these calculations it becomes clear that Business of Friday ($480) is lower than Thursday ($520) By how much? To determine this, simply subtract the lower total revenue figure(of Friday,which is $480 ) from the higher one (for Thursday amounting to $520).
