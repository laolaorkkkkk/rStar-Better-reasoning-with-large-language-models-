Since both the newborn house cats were multiples of 12 (i.e., 12*n), one may assume that one of them is twice the other. Let the number of kittens for the first be n; hence the second would be 2*n. Also, we know that 40/2=20 and thus summing up the kittens from both sides gives us a relationship which looks like this: 2(n)+21=3*(20-n). Solving the equation, n is found to be 3.

T will represent Trixie's kitten count. That means Patchy's kitten count will be 3T. Now since Trixie has 12 plus all the kittens Patchy has, which is 3T, her total kitten count is 12+3T. Since this is also equal to the initial kitten count of the Doubtfires of 7, we have 7=12+3T, solving for which we get T=(7-12)/(3)=(-5)/(3) = (-5 / 3) kittens. So Patchy has ((-5/3) x (3)) = 5 kittens and Trixie has 12 kittens. So altogether the Doubtfires have 7 + 5 + 12 = 24 kittens. The answer is: 24 kittens",

Patchy, the first cat, has had 7 kittens twice as many kittens as Trixie, the other cat, has had. We know the number of kittens had by Patchy is twice the number had by Trixie. Let x represent the number of kittens had by Trixie. 7x=12. This is because the number of kittens had by Patchy is twice the number had by Trixie. 7x=12 can be written as 12 / 7 = x. If the douftire family had 7 kittens, x should be 12 divided by 7. Because of this, the number of kittens of the Doubftire family will be the sum of the 7 kittens initially, and the number having by x. The answer to our initial question should be 7 + x. The Doubtfire sisters have 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter. Their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. Patchy, the first cat, has had 7 kittens twice as many kittens as Trixie, the other cat, has had. The number of kittens had by Trixie is 12/7.

        " of their house cats, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as they have. Let's call this value N. That means that the number of kittens that their mother told them about plus three times the number of adopted kittens they initially had is N. We also know that another of their housecats, Trixie, had twelve kittens herself. So the total is N + 3N + 12. 3N + 12 is equivalent to (3 + 1)N + 12 since we can multiply both sides of an equation by 3 and factor out a 3 from the 3N term. That leaves us with 4N + 12. We then add the kittens they originally adopted, yielding 4N + 12 + 7, which simplifies to 4N + 19. Now we need to use our original information: we are told that the number Patchy had multiplied by three is equal to twice the total amount of kittens they now have. Twice the total amount of kittens they now have is twice the sum of 4N + 19 and twelve, which is 2(4N + 19 + 12), or 2(4N + 31). Since Patchy's number multiplied by three equals this, we know that 3Patchy multiplied by 2 is equal to it, which yields: 3Patchy = 2(4N + 31). Simplifying both sides of this yields 3 * 4N + 92 = 2(4N + 31). Finally, we can isolate N: N(6 + 3) = 2(4N + 31) - 92. Solving for N, we find N to be 6. Therefore, the family has a total of 6N, or 36 cats. The answer is: 36.",

Since Trixie had twice as many kittens as Patchy, we get 2 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 = 14. Adding this result to the previously adopted 7, we get 7 + 14 = 21. Finally, because the initial kitten count was 7, we find that the adopted kittens are double the initial count. Double of 7, or 7+7=14 kittens. That means that since Trixie has 12, she must have had six extra kittens beyond the original 7. Adding this to the 14 we already calculated, we get 14 + 6 = 20 kittens. However, remember the initial kitten count was 7, which we doubled, therefore the total amount of kittens in the Doubtfire house should be seven times 7 or 49. We only calculated 20, which is double the initial value of seven; but this doesn't match our calculation of having triple Patchy's kitten number. This means our total kitten count is wrong and must be adjusted to be 28 instead of 20. So Patchy has 3x7 + 1 which is 22 kittens and Trixie has 6 more than Patchy because she has 12 so her total is 28 kittens and if you add all those up you get 50 kittens.

Trixie's kittens aren't told specifically, so we use this information to figure out the number: because we know there are seven initial kittens, three times the number of initial kittens is 3*7=21. But what if it was actually six times the initial kitten count instead? Six times would be 28, which is the same amount as we already computed from Patchy!

To solve this equation with x being the unknown quantity, one can use simple algebra techniques such as dividing both sides by 7 which leaves only three values: x=0 (this solution makes no sense), X=2 (the answer to our question!) or x = 4. We know X cannot equal either of these last two values because if X equals zero then Patchy would be infertile whereas if X equals four Trixie's number would exceed hers by far too much.

So, if we take root (root_a) of 31 or we take root of any other positive perfect square number like 25 - x^2=root_a^2 = 25 or 9 - x^2= root_b^2 = 3, so you can see that all those square numbers have equal value of root which is \u221aN where N is square number...
