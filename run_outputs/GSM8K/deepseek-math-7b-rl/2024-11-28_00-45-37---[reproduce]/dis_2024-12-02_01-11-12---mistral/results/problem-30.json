        " can represent him as $y$, where $y=100$, so this equation would be represented as $7x + 11y=162$, solving it using substitution (which means we replace something with another thing), when we have $x=63$, $162-63=100$ and $\\frac{162}{7}$ = $23$, we could also use this formula where $a+b(n)$ is replaced by $c$, which means it is the same, only rearranged, as in the problem. And if this was in the form of $cx + b=(nx)$, you could solve for c which, in this case, is $100$. When you put all this together into one equation (where $\\frac{7}{18}x+\\frac{11}{18}n=100$), the solution would be $x=63$ and $n=60$. This could also work for the reverse problem ($ax+by=z$) where you can substitute $\\frac{z}{a}$ as $x$ and $\\frac{z}{b}$ as $y$, therefore $\\frac{z}{x}+\\frac{z}{y}=150\\rightarrow\\frac{150z}{xy}=150$, which simplifies as $\\frac{z}{(xy)}$ = $1$, then when you divide both sides by $\\frac{z}{(xy)}$, you get a similar fraction to when you do division. Therefore you can multiply all the terms by the denominator, which becomes $\\frac{xy^2}{x^2y}=\\frac{x^2(x^2)}{(xy)(xy)}=\\frac{(x^4)}{xy}$. Which results in solving for y, or $x^4=150$, so $x=5$ and therefore $y=30$. Since $x$ and $y$ aren't real numbers (because square roots aren't integers in some cases). But when you switch it around ($x^3+y^3=z^3$) which happens to produce real numbers (only non zero ones), you could set $w$ as $\\sqrt[3]{z}$, so $\\sqrt[3]{z}$ is actually $w^3$, and $\\sqrt[3]{w^3}=z$.

        " here we divide both sides by 18 since $x$ is part of the equation. To find allen's age after ten years simply add 10 years to darrell's age and use our formula.
