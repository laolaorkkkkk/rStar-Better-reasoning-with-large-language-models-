Finally we get the amount of left overwater equal 15 (15 litres). Therefore our solution lies herewith : two girls each received a quarter or one sixth , and also got six times more litre than they wanted ;so finally you may calculate how much water is there for them at present time since these numbers seem to be accurate but still unknown whether either party needs any further clarification about this problem.

        " let's divide everything into sixths first. This will make it easier. We can find out what one sixth is. First we will add the number 6 together six times. That is because you told us the ratio was 1/6 . If we add it up like this: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 That equals 36. Divide 36 by 6. Do you remember what the symbol for division is? It is the forward slash \"/\". Just put that symbol before the 6 to divide it by 6 like this: 36 / 6 When you get 6 from dividing something by 6, that means that it was originally divided into 6 equal parts. So it would mean each of the 6 groups of things would contain 1 group of things. Since we know each group of things contains 1 group of things, then all of the original 24 cups must have contained 24 / 6 = 4 groups of things. So if there were 4 groups of things that originally contained 24 cups then each group of things contained: 24 / 4 = 6 cups. 1/6 is another way to say 6 / 24. It means it is 1 portion or 1 piece out of 24 portions or pieces. Now that we know what one portion looks like, we can start using the information we have to help solve our problem. We have been told the girls combined split the 24 cups in the same exact ratio. But instead of 1/6 they split the 24 cups in two groups. Since there are two groups, let's see what 2/6 looks like. The whole thing will still look like 2 / 6 so we just take whatever we would have gotten from one portion and multiply it by two since there are now 2 groups. Let's go through the math in detail. I am going to use the math symbol \"*\" instead of the word \"times\" or \"multiply\" when doing multiplication. So if I wanted to find 3 times 5, I could write: 3 * 5 The \"multiplied by\" part uses the \"*\" sign in this case. You said that both girls split the 24 cups equally, in 1/6 portions.
