        " calculate how much money he earned on Friday, we need to know how many car tires he repaired. Because the question asks about a day when more revenue was earned than another, we already know this amount is greater. Let's make that number k, knowing that there were 12 car tires repaired on the day it was more. Now, since the revenue is greater, the number of tires being repaired must also be greater. Let's call this number T. K and T need to add up to 12. Therefore, (k + t) = 12. We already know the value of k, so we can solve for T and find its value. 12 = k + t (substitute in k=12 into above equation)   12 = 12 + t (move term on right side over and subtract 12 on both sides, to isolate t)   t = 0 (t = 12 on right - 12 on left). We found t has a value of 0. This means only k tires were repaired on Friday. Finally, calculate the revenue made on Friday. We found there were 12 car tires which brought in a collective $12 * 40 = $480. With only 0 trucks, no truck tires were repaired. Thus, the Friday revenue will be 0.

By subtracting each smaller revenue from this we obtain our respective changes in revenue.That is, let\u2019s see how much more/less money is spent on any individual repair by comparing the new figure with the old one.

This tells us that there is a $360-$0=$\\$360$ increase in revenue gained through fixing truck tires!Similarly, when determining if we also make less money on repairs for auto tires due to changing prices, we once again subtract our original amount ($160) from whatever is paid to the mechanic now (which comes down to $0): \\(-\\$$160+$0=-\\$$160$.

To confirm everything we will look closer at why specifically automobiles would offer bigger rewards compared to those pertaining only heavier machines yet also ensuring smaller ones wouldn\u2019t pose problems because both groups have similar benefits despite their differences overall so it makes logical sense why choosing them strategically should be taken care off properly prior starting whatever undertaking might lead itself toward such opportunities being created along way without having missed out anything crucial initially leading towards possible outcomes.
