Therefore, her total pace for the trail should be lower than the average rate she wants to finish at to allow herself to go slowly but steadily towards this final goal.

Therefore, Marissa would need to walk at an average speed of 1.5 miles per hour if she wants her overall average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Finally, substituting x = 1.5 into the original expression, we get: 12/(2 + (remaining distance)/x), where x = 1.5. This expression evaluates to 12/(2 + (remaining distance)/(1.5)), which further simplifies to 12/3, or 4. Therefore, if she walks at an average speed of 1.5 miles per hour, she will take approximately 3 hours to complete the rest of the hike. The answer is: 1.5",

        " for 2 hours at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. She has walked a total of 6 miles during those 2 hours. Since she still has 6 miles left to go, she will only have 1 hour to complete the remaining 6 miles. To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she would need to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The answer is: 6.",
        " she walks $6$ miles per hour, she will meet her goal. So the answer is: 6 miles per hour.",
        " her average speed to be 4 miles/hour, x * T = 12. That means (remaining distance)/x = T - 2. Substitute that into our equation to get x^2 * (T - 2) = 4 * T - 4. So x^2 = 4T - 8. Since this was supposed to be an equation with a positive solution, I'll take the square root of both sides, so \u221a(x^2) = sqrt(4T - 8). Finally, x = sqrt(4T - 8). Since she wants T = 6, this means that x = sqrt(4 * 6 - 8), which means x = sqrt(16 - 8), or x = sqrt(8), which means x = 2sqrt(2). The answer is: 2\u221a2",
        " we get: 12 = 4(2 + (remaining distance)/x). Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 12/4 = (2 + (remaining distance)/x). Solving for x, we get: x = 12 / ((2 + (remaining distance)) / 4). To solve this equation, we can start from knowing the value of \"T\", or 2 + (remaining distance)/x. Since we know that Marissa walked 6 miles in the first 2 hours, we can write: 6 = 2 + (remaining distance)/x. Rearranging, we get: (remaining distance)/x = 6 - 2. Substituting into the above equation we get: x = 12 / (4 + 6 - 2) which equals 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.",
        " sides by 4, we get: 1 = (remaining distance)/x. Multiplying both sides by x, we get: x = (remaining distance). To find the value of x, we must plug in the values of all variables into this last equation. The value of x should equal the answer in units of miles per hour. Plugging in the values of remaining distance and time gives: x = (12 - (6 + 6)) / ((2 + (12 - 6)) / 4). Performing the division and then subtracting, we get: x = 12 / (2 + (12 - 6)) / 4. Combining fractions, we get: x = (12*4) / ((2+6)*4). Simplifying using basic arithmetic operations gives: x = 12*4 / (8*4). This reduces to: x = 12/8. Finally, dividing by 4 gives: x = 3 miles per hour. This tells us that Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The answer is therefore \"3\".",

        " 4 miles per hour, let's equate 4 to 6/T. Multiplying both sides by T, we get 4T = 6. Therefore, T = 6/4 = 3/2. Thus, the speed (x) that she needs to walk the remaining distance to accomplish this is x = (total distance to go) / T = (12 - 6) / (3/2) = 2.

Simplifying, we get: 4(remaining distance)/x = 4. Solving for x, we get: 4*x = 16. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 4. Therefore, the speed that Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is 4 miles per hour. The answer is: 4.",

Its value describes how quickly the function is increasing at each point x in its domain; the bigger the deff-of-ex quantity, the faster the function varies. Here Marris's pace varies only within certain increments since it maintains its value over certain intervals (see table below) , so a constant speed (constant pace) implies zero velocity at any given moment because there is no variation.
