        " that in total there was twelve less rabbits then pets I'll assume that $X$ represents the number of rabbits. Since it said $D+C=X$ then we can rewrite this equation as \\begin{align*} D+2D &= X+12\\\\[4pt] 3D &= X+12\\\\[4pt] D &= \\frac{X+12}{3}\\\\[4pt] \\end{align*} Now using this information about $D$ we can go back to our original statement which tells us that $D=60$. This then gives \\begin{align*} D&=60\\\\[4pt] D&= \\frac{X+12}{3}\\\\[4pt] 3D&=3(X+12)\\\\[4pt] \\end{align*} From here you can solve for $X$ to get $$\\boxed{360}.$$Yes Since it said that the number of doges is $60$, by the last equaion $$\\text{\"}D = \\frac{X+12}{3}\\text{\"}$$ then you can substitute in $D=60$ on both sides. Then $$\\frac{60+12}{3}=\\frac{72}{3}=24$$ Therefore since there are 2 cats for each dog then there must be 48 cats. Since we also know that in total there is $\\boxed{210}$ pets then this means there are 48 cats plus 23 dogs plus 42 rabbits equals in total $\\boxed{210}$. Since we are told that there are 60 dogs this gives us $$48+23+42=113$$dogs. Now since we know this plus the fact that there are 113 dogs plus 48 cats plus 42 rabbit gives $\\boxed{210}$ we have $$\\boxed{210}=113+48+42.$$ Thus we can see that our work was correct because all three terms add up to the same thing.",

R = C*(2) = 96 R-C must also be negative since there are twelve less cats and the subtraction of the two variables is twelve. Therefore solving for C we see that 96-R = -12 Subtracting both sides by 96 to find for C we have C=-12-(96-R)=(R-20) Since C was defined as the difference of all of our Pets minus Rabbits or in other words 12 and we substituted the negative sign of one of those numbers because it was negative to begin with then we simply remove the negative. Adding positive signs to either side leaves us with (R-20) which when solved equals 46 This equation would state that the Pets would sum up to a combined value of 46. I hope this helps.
