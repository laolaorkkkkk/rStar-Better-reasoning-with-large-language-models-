        " Since it is stated that the original price was last years best seller, the best selling book may not necessarily indicate a high value (in terms of the price), rather it could simply mean that it was the most well received novel last year. Therefore, we consider the original price to be relatively low compared to others which would ultimately lead us to deduce that the best seller was most likely to be somewhere around \\$20+ or less. Using some common sense, and assuming it costs anywhere up to roughly around \\$50 per book, I would say its safe to assume that a book of this popularity may never exceed over a \\$100, because that would be considered expensive. Again, since we do not have information regarding the book itself, we can conclude that the books original price, and the price it was sold for with the discount included is within the range of \\$20-\\$30, thus making our solution $\\boxed{\\mathbf{26}}$$.

This is why the original book must have cost 26 dollars. As for the other possibilities, we'll rule them out one by one using a process of elimination. Firstly, remember that 24 isn't divisible by 3 so it cannot be an option. Furthermore if you use the calculator method and divide by 0.75 you get 26.6666... which rounds up to 27 not 26. And since 25 isn't divisible by three either and when calculating we get around 26.67... which again leads us back down towards our original solution of 26 dollars; thus confirming that out of all four given numbers, only one yields accurate results - namely 26!

        " If 25% off is equal to 75 cents/dollar, you could just multiply it by a factor of 4 instead of dividing it, which is faster for small problems like this! If we take 25% off the value, that is equal to $19.50 - $4.875. If you divide that by .25, you get $$$\\frac{19.50-.75}{(.25)(1)}=$$$(which is faster!). Therefore, the correct solution is $$\\$\\boxed{26}$.$$ As we discussed previously, this makes sense because the 25% means that we have reduced the value by 25%, effectively leaving us with 3/4ths of the original value. To double check your work, simply convert 25% to a decimal (that is, convert 25/100 to 1/4), then add that to 1 and simplify -- if you have the right answer the result will be 1! In our example, adding 1/4 to 1 is 1 + 1/4 == 1, which passes that test. This technique also works well when you need to calculate values like $1975-$443.75 or even $9888.15-$2466.03 - if you don't want to bother doing the exact calculations all of the time, converting percentages into decimals can save you time! However, note that with larger numbers it is not recommended to use this method directly since converting those big fractions takes quite a bit of time...you can still convert them as shown above but make sure it's quick enough not to slow you down significantly! Also remember that if we know what percentage one thing increases by and we subtract that amount from its own starting point, then we will find out what its new current value is. In other words, for instance if something increased by 1% then subtracting 1% of that initial value would give its new present-day worth! You also shouldn't forget about rounding errors which may creep into certain situations where both numbers involved have several digits beyond their first significant figure; such cases can lead easily to mistakes even after taking care of any arithmetic issues associated with percentages or otherwise dealing with large figures properly (e.g., multiplication",
