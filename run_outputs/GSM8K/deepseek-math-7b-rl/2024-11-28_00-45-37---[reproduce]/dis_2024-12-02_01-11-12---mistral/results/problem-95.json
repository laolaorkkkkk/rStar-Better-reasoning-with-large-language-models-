Secondly, since we don''t know the gender breakdown of the class overall, we can only use information about girls here, so we would need to multiply the fraction by 120. However, if you divide 120 by itself the answer is still 1, so we could leave out the multiplication sign. The expression would look like (2/3)*120.

Our new equation looks like: 'Total''Girls''-''Girl''Scout''=60.'''To summarize, the only two numbers needed in the solution are the total amount of girls and the total amount of people who are members of the girl scout. All other information is irrelevant, since it does not affect the count. The original prompt asked us to solve using fractions, and there was no information about whether or not any students were male. Therefore, we used only one equation based off what we knew (there were 120 female students in the grade, and 2/3 of them are female scouts). By subtracting the two, we arrived at our correct answer. This math example shows the importance of reading carefully and using logic to find patterns. While using fractions may seem intimidating, it is possible to simplify problems even further once the appropriate information is obtained. By understanding the question and applying logic, solving mathematical equations such as these becomes much easier.

Since the number of female students must equal half of their total population when they are male students minus female students equals zero, you could add one male group and subtract another from your original value until you get back to zero. For example, you might start off with the fraction 30 \u00e2\u0160\u2022 40 because 10 + 14 = 24 (18).
