As long as there are eggs, that extra yield earns money at the farmers' market. When she has none of her own anymore due to her ducks laying fewer in an average day than her consumption patterns, she ends up earning nothing at her second job. In other words, there would never be zero eggs, though it may appear so if one forgets Janet's ducks are able to keep producing even when she runs out. As we noted above, $18 per day is a fixed amount, but not its total revenue; because of the nature of eggs and the time at which they\u2019re sold or consumed, this sum can actually vary widely depending on what you consider part of your 'daily income.' This problem is simple enough that it could easily be solved by using elementary algebra skills if necessary; let's take $n=$ ",
        " This is because each egg yields $2 profit only if it is sold. Given how many eggs are produced daily and how many of them she discards for food, she can earn $ at farmers market based on the following formula: Number of Eggs Discarded Daily = 3+4=7. Profit in Dollars = \\$/Daily Egg Production. Plugging numbers into the equation gives us the profit of $6 at farmers market, which can be calculated as follows: Profit at Farmer's Market = 2*7(eggs discarded)=$14.

This is true for any period (timeframe) as long as the attendance is limited to just a single time slot each day. If however this isn't restricted then more money can actually be made since 9 x $2 multiplies into what turns out as almost double profits gained weekly because 2*9=18 &10%of18= 1.80 which means that in a week if you could go twice then theoretically it would total to about twice as much as 18x$2=36 &9%of36=3.24 which shows that Janets earnings aren't always set by fixed prices and instead depend largely on how often they choose not only to frequent these establishments but also during certain periods where availability might vary greatly even amongst those who tend show up less frequently at said locations . So while we know for sure that these ducks may well lay at least 18 eggs daily which works out nicely when calculating profits derived solely from attending market places , it should be kept in mind though there exists no real way around knowing exactly how often someone will turn up given limited information regarding the schedule so this could change depending on any number",
