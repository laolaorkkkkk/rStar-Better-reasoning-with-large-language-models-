As long as there are enough numbers involved in determining all aspects of this situation including Artie\u2019s sales income & product specific details we should be able to find an accurate answer! Let's review all our data once again : We know what Artie pays per flower type - Rounded Up prices based upon calculations above are as follows: 1 Mari=$2.74; 2 Peg-$1.87; 3 Beg-$2.12 Therefore total revenues generated from those sales can vary depending upon quantities & specific values assigned per unit cost . But suppose we'll assume Artie sells all 12 Pot Maris @ roundup value $3 Each ( Total income: $36 ) Similarly if he sells all 9 Pots Petuns @ roundup value $2 each ( Total income = $18 ) Lastly Arties profit generated from selling 17 Begonia's at round-up value price point equaling $2 per pot yields additional net gain totaling about $34 When adding together these results it turns out that all these products combined produced approximately an estimated earnings of around $88 Dollars during this particular period ! Which means that after deducting any associated expenses such as packaging materials or other labor costs etc., he would still have remaining funds equal to somewhere around fifty six bucks ! Hopefully our findings helped out ! Thanks again for visiting Artie's store today!",
        " dollars total, then nine containers of petunias for eighteen dollars, and seventeen units of begonia for about thirty four dollars. Adding these numbers will equal sixty eight dollars, your total amount of income. We can confirm this answer by determining if the profit from each unit was greater or less than it was before rounding. For instance, selling one container of Marigolds (which previously brought in just under two dollars) still brings in around two dollars but will only receive one instead of three due to no changes on your end other than price adjustment. These amounts total out correctly since three dollars times fourteen equals roughly forty six which is close enough to fifty three that we know both calculations worked properly resulting into an accurate result being calculated by rounding instead!

Finally let's compare that to our initial information and see that this answer is the same as when Artie makes 12 pots of marigolds which cost him 24$. From there, he made 9 pots of petunias which amounted to $18 and lastly he sold 17 bags of begonias for 34$. This means he made a total of $76.

That yields to a summed value of: $$33\\$+$$33\\$+$$17\\$=$$\\$73.** By simply comparing both the original rounded values vs unrounded amounts, we can clearly see how the difference between them is almost entirely caused just by the rounding itself: Unrounded vs Rounded: (**32**.\"**88 - *33*=$$$6**.11**) / ($**16**.\"**83-$$\\)**17$=$\\)**-0**.\"16), ($**36**.\"**04-$$\\)**33**=$7**.41**/($17- *33*=$5$).

We don\u00b4t have enough cash for change so rounding must occur! Let\u00b4s take a closer look. Notice that one dollar can always contain a minimum of two quarters, a dime, nickle or penny. In the case of a dime this means that you can always add 10 cents of the previous sum to make it into a whole dollar, for example 10cents is $$36.64$$+$$$1.00=$$$37.64$$. The same goes for any other coin value, just remember that you CAN NOT subtract, only add! Therefore our new price structure becomes: Petunias become **$1.87*(1.00+.08)$=$(2.18)$$**, Marigolds are always rounded down so stay unchanged (**$$2.74(1.00)=2.74$**) and beggonias become **$2.12(1.00+.03)$$(2.15)**. Plugging this back into our old formula, we get a value of ($$32.88$$+$$$16.63$$+$$$37.14$$)$$=$$$86.65$$! And viola! The final solution is that the rounded price comes out as ($$$86.65)**$$.",
        " the nearest Dollar value. What happens now that we are going to use a simplified approximation? Well first of all note that since all our prices multiplied by their corresponding quantities would add to 85.75$ but then rounded only come down to 86$, It means that we are going to lose approximately ($$$86-85.75=)$$$0.**25**$$ dollars every time rounding a number that wasn\u2019t already rounded prior. So now we can take out our original calculations (Marigolds being $32$.88, petunias being $16$ **.$83**, And begonias having sales amount of $36$ .**04**$) but instead simply subtract $*$$**25**$* (0.25) from each one separately. This is important as it ensures we have consistent results even though this method may seem a bit more tedious than others available!

We also know that Petunia pots had been previously priced at $1.87 however once again due to lack of change offered these would come out as a whole dollar sum being charged resulting in only half being taken away or $9 total earned off sale(s).

Here is the calculation for marigolds: 12 x 3 = 36 Next, we calculate the cost of the petunias and begonias: 9 x 2 = 18 17 x 2 = 34 Next, we add these three values together to find the total amount Artie made: 36 + 18 + 34 = 88Finally, we can use the money Artie made to calculate the profit. The total revenue from sales was $88, but the cost of flowers was $50. To calculate the profit, we take $88 and subtract $50 from it. That equals $38, which is the amount of profit Artie made from the sale. The equation would look like this: Revenue \u2013 Cost = Profit or $88 \u2013 $50 = $38.In this case, the profit from selling 38 pots of flowers at the Farmer's Market was $38.

We also know that he has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. This means that Artie would make $3 per pot of marigold, $2 per pot of petunia, and $2 per pot of begonia. Next, we can determine how many pots of each flower Artie sold. We know that he sold 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias.
