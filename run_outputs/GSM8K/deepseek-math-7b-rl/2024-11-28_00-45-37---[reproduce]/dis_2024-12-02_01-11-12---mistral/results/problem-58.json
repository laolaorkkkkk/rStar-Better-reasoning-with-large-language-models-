If the initial grocery bill was $40 and there were any previous charges, let's say $3, then we would add the two numbers together to get $40 + $3 = $43. Next, we multiply that sum by 0.25 to obtain the 25% fee amount: $43 \u00d7 0.25 = $10.75. So, the additional 25% fee amounts to $10.75. Once we obtain the final price including all applicable charges, we can subtract the original grocery bill amount of $40 and deliver fee of $3 to find out how much was added due solely to the tip: $58.75 \u2013 (40 + 3) = $15.75. This means the tip added $15.75 to the original grocery bill. Since the tip was only $4, it was not quite enough to cover the full amount of taxes and fees. That being said, as Stephen's overall contribution did contribute positively towards making up a part of that difference, he may still consider it a worthy gesture in light of having helped cover a portion of these costs.",

Your bill was originally $43 and then the company took 25% and added another $10.65 to their charge ($43 * 25%). However I know that if you had just purchased something costing $53, the total added charge would have been $13.25 (so %25 of 53 is 13.25).. therefore 25% of the original purchase was equivalent to an extra $10.65 because I used my knowledge of the relationship between different percentages and values to calculate what I needed."
