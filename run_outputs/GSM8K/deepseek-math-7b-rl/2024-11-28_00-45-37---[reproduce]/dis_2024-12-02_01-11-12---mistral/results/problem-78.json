First we should consider Vincent's initial plan, which consisted of buying his flowers individually. If it worked out that he could buy an integer number of packages in threes instead, then it would still work out that he could buy an integer number of packages in twos. This would mean that the best possible scenario happens if he has exactly one leftover flower. That flower must be bought for a single dollar; in other words, Vincent doesn't get to enjoy the 2 dollar packages that have 2 flowers. That means that he saves $\\frac{(n*2.5) - 1}{2}$ dollars from his purchase of individual flowers compared to the case where he buys them in packages in threes. If you replace the original n with 18 and plug into the expression above, this comes out to $\\frac{(18*2.5) - 1}{2} = $17.05. Thus, Vincent saves about $17 on the purchase of his 18 flowers if he buys them in packages instead of individually. The answer is: $17.05.",

That would be the same as buying two packages of nine flowers because each of these packages cost him one dollar each which together make 2 times 1 dollars or simply 2$, but that's not how this particular question works since it asks about savings from choosing just one single better price instead getting both better prices together through group purchase options like buying multiple times larger amounts (i..e: buying more than 18). So here it is important only considering what happens if choosing option 'A', not B... We want all other costs included too! Thus there isn't really anything left over because when paying exactly twenty four hundredthousandths less than would have otherwise happened due solely based upon using those higher level purchasing schemes available suchlike those used by certain shops providing additional discounts during bulk purchases \u2013 just remember though that those savings still occur regardless even when you opt not for those extra advantages offered since everything else stays constant \u2013 however now applying our newly found rule (theoretically speaking anyway) should prove helpful enough so far so good\u2026 With that said let us continue our journey now towards solving yet another problem...

This means he buys either 18/3 = 6 lots of three roses for $2.50 each, or 18/2 = 9 packs of 2 roses for $1 each. The first option is more expensive because $2.50/2 = $1.25 which is greater than $1. Therefore, the answer will be found by using the formula $18-$19=$1. By spending the same amount of money, Vincent could instead have purchased one of 9 packs containing 2 roses each instead of the original 18. The price per rose for the 2-pack was $1 as compared to $2.50 for the 3-pack, so the price difference between the two packs would be $0.50 per rose. In this case, Vincent could have saved 0.50*18 = $9 on the flowers that he buys by switching to the more efficient buying method of 2-packs.",

He needed 18 roses, so if he bought three for $2.50\u20266 sets, 3 roses per set = 3 * 6 = 18 roses. 18 divided by three, six times... So he had to buy just six groups of three roses, which is $6 * $2.50 = $15. But suppose he wanted to buy 2 roses for every one dollar; 18 divided by two, which is 9 sets\u20269 times a pair of roses\u2026 So 9 * $1 = $9.

        " size packages. How much money Vincent saves depends on the amount of money he spend and the package of flowers that yields him the best deal. Let\u2019s assume Vincent buys 18 roses. If he chooses to buy the smaller packages of 2 for $1 each, that will make it 18/2 = 9 purchases of the smaller package. Each individual purchase costs $1 so the total amount is 9\u00d7$1=$9. On the other hand, if Vincent purchases 18 roses using the larger packages of 3 for $2.50 each, each purchase costs $2.50. So the total amount is 18/3=6 purchases \u00d7 $2.50 = $15. By choosing to use the larger, bulkier packages, Vincent actually pays more ($15) than what he would pay using the smaller packages ($9). Therefore, by choosing to buy the smaller packages of 2 for $1 each, he effectively saves $6! It is important to note that saving $6 only happens when Vincent buys precisely 18 roses, since this is the scenario that lets us compare the two different prices and figure out which one costs less per flower. If Vincent was to buy any other number of roses, he would have to purchase fewer packs of three (i.e. 15 packs), which is why he\u2019d get a slightly different answer that\u2019ll always be lower than $6. For example, if he were to buy 15 roses, the cost per flower with the larger package of 3 for $2.50 is ($2.50/3)*15=$5, while the cost per flower with the smaller package of 2 for $1 is ($1/2)*15=$7.5, so his savings are actually $2.5 rather than $6 in this specific case.

And finally, since our original price was in packages of 3 roses and not individual roses, we just multiply that value by three, to get the correct answer\u2026$13.50x3 = $40.50.

First, we need to calculate how many flowers of each kind we can buy. For the package of 3 for $2.50, Vincent can buy 18 / 3 = 6 sets of 3 flowers, for a total of 18 flowers. Similarly, for the package of 2 for $1, Vincent can buy 18 / 2 = 9 sets of 2 flowers, for a total of 18 flowers. As we have just seen, 18 flowers can be purchased for a total of 2 x $0.50 = $1 less than the $15.00 Vincent paid before. Therefore, buying 18 flowers for $1 each saves Vincent $1 compared to buying 18 flowers for $2.50 each.",

Next, we compare these two values side by side. If $2.50 can get us 3 roses, and $1 can get us 2, then $1 must provide less roses than $2.50 (because the first calculation shows us 3 roses for $2.50, while the second gives only 2 roses for $1). Therefore, when we purchase roses in lots of 3, we're getting better deals than when we purchase them in lots of 2 (because we can get 1 more rose for our buck). So, what if Vincent were to buy 18 roses as individuals? Let's plug 18 into $0.83. $0.83 x 18 = $15.24\u2026How about if he was to buy them in lots of 3? We can use the same method. $0.50 x 18= $9.

The cost of purchasing these 36 flowers is $36 x $1 = $36 total. By contrast, if Vincent were to purchase the package of 3 flowers for $2.50 each, he would have purchased only 36/$3 = 12 flowers. The total cost of these 12 flowers is $12*2.50=$30, making them approximately six dollars more expensive than if Vincent bought individual flowers.

Thus you now know the math but where is the logic ? Why did I tell you to use the more expensive option ? Well what if for argument sake the flower salesman who is clearly the devil charges different rates for his product at each time frame during a period of a day , or maybe you don\u2019t know Vincent\u2019s favorite flower (perhaps you are his wife trying to figure this out in secret ) and you know he likes more than one type of bud . By being able to see all the possible combinations of which ever flower he prefers , the options in the next case open up exponentially ! But even if the cost was the same for all three scenarios it doesn\u2019t matter because either way you could purchase more individual flowers with the 3-pack plan than the 2-pack plan and at the same time save money when going for cheaper bulk deals . To sum up , when you think about what it really means for each price tag on an item such as this , try not just looking at quantity versus value but also factor in things like variety , choice ,and whatever other information may exist concerning both sides .",

Next let us determine whether buying both kinds together saves money overall so take their prices times our new values just calculated before : q1(3 *2 .5)= $15 vs p(2 *1 )= $18 .So yes indeed we do actually make quite a bit less expense going through all available options prior instead of sticking only w/ just three bunches . Finally notice our previous outcome would be equal exactly with no loss if only 5 of them could actually cost less rather than having 2+15=$19 left which wouldn't work because buying multiple things never makes them cheaper .
