        " pound we can just multiply 30 with 1/4 which equals 7.5. Thus, if 30 comics are removed, it adds up to 7.5 pounds. Then, 15 minus 7.5 equals 7.5 which is the difference between 15 pounds (goal) and 7.5 pounds (removed comics). And since every toy weights 1/2 pound, we multiply this by 15 to get 15 which means 15 toys need to be removed as well. To sum everything up: Let's start with the initial situation: There are originally 30 comics. This means the original weight is 30*1/4 pounds. Then the user removes some of them. They take exactly 30 of the comics away. Now, since every item has a weight and that weight is 1/4, the total weight of the items that were taken away becomes 30*1/4= 1/2. The rest are 20 of the original amount which equals 1 pound. Then, they take another 20 off of the 30 which means they have only 5 of these items left. And the weight becomes 5*1/4. The second part of the question wants us to subtract everything so far. First, we will subtract the items that was already taken away. Therefore we remove the items that were removed during the first part of the question. So subtraction of 20+10+10 yields: 30 - 20 = 10. Next we subtract the remaining weight from that. Which gives us: 10 - 5/4 = (10 - 5) / 4 = 5/4. Finally the total weight of the remaining objects is simply: 10+5 = 15.",
        " the other 5.5 pounds from 15 leaving 5.2 pounds for which he needs to find out what number of toys corresponds to this weight. Again using $1/2$ for the weight of every toy, we divide 5.2 pounds by $1/2$, which equals 5.2*2=10.4 which rounded off means 10. This therefore gives Uriah an option to either remove another ten toys or combine both options and take away the 30 comics as well as the 10 toys and thus lighten the weight of his back pack enough so that he can carry it again.
