Well honestly anything other than city streets would suffice because these types of places make cars work harder when traversing through them compared say versus just cruising down open highways where air flows freely without having traffic constantly around which causes drag force upon automobiles causing them not only consume more fuel however this also means less power output from engines due increased friction within their internal workings therefore ultimately affecting overall performance negatively effect too.. So perhaps something along lines 85mph average speed limits found often times encountered along statewide interstates systems might serve purposes well enough here assuming everything else remained constant between both situations being compared against e.g.; same type fuel source, engine size etc...

Since her tank holds 12 gallons, and she gets 25 mpg, she can travel 25 * 12 = 300 miles on a full tank of gas. Therefore, if Sophia starts driving when her gas tank is empty, she can drive for about 300 miles before needing to refill her tank. However, since Sophia already drove 100 miles since refilling her tank, she actually has only 100+300 = 400 remaining miles of gas in her tank. In conclusion, Sophia's car can run for about 300 miles on a full tank, but she currently has enough fuel to drive about 400 miles. Thus, to maximize her distance traveled, she should start driving as soon as possible!",

Multiply the number of miles traveled per gallon by the capacity of the tank to find the furthest distance one can travel in a tank of gas. That means we multiply the mileage per gallon by the capacity of the fuel cell. So to determine how many miles he can drive on the capacity of his fuel cell, multiply the per-gallon distance traveled (25) by the volume of the fuel cell which holds 12 gallons of gas (25 * 12= 300 miles. Therefore, he can drive up to 300 miles on each tank of gas as determined by the math. Hope that helps!",

In fact, because she only filled up the car when it was almost empty, she probably even got more than 300 miles out of the 12 gallons, but you don't need all those details to solve the problem.

        ". Dividing the number of gallons in the tank by the rate at which our vehicle uses them gives us a range. Since 12 gallons divided by 25 miles per gallon yields a value greater than 1, we know that if our tank holds more fuel than 25 miles' worth (25 is the number we get when we divide the amount in gallons by the average fuel efficiency), then we have enough gas for a trip! In this case, dividing 12 gallons into 25 miles per gallon gives us 0.48 miles per gallon or just over half a mile of driving for every gallon of fuel used ($0.48$ is obtained by multiplying 12 gallons times 25 miles per gallon). So, since there are 0.48 miles worth of space for gas in our car compared to the 25 mile maximum driving capacity per gallon, we can say that we can drive approximately $\\frac{12\\cdot25}{0.48}$ miles before running out of gas. To make the problem as simple as possible, let's round down to avoid fractions, resulting in a conservative estimate ($12x$ will yield a higher value than $12$, but will be easy for our brains to work with!); in doing so, we conclude that 225 miles is achievable (our round-down value is $225/0.48$, meaning 225 rounded down to 200 yields the result). Hence, we can conclude that 225 miles is the maximum number of miles one could drive on one full tank of fuel using this car model, as indicated in its owner's manual.",
