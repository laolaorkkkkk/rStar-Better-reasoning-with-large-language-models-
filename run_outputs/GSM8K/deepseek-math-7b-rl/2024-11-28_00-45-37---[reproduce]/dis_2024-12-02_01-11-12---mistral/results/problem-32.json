If there are ten dogs, it would take about 15 minutes to take care of each one. John will be caring for a whole week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of canines, which amounts to 7 times as many hours (thus the division by .25) and is therefore equal to 2.5 hours per day. Finally, multiply the 2.5 hours by 7 days (for a full week) to get the total hours for walking and caring for the 10 dogs over the course of one week; i.e., 2.5*7=17.5. Therefore, John will spend approximately 17.5 hours taking care of these dogs on a weekly basis. The answer is: 17.5.",
        " Multiple that by the amount of time John spends on each dog. That means John spends 5 * 7 hours per week tending to his dogs. As such, John can tend to his own 10 dogs every week. John takes care of 10 dogs and it takes 5 hours to take care of those 10 dogs per day. Therefore it takes him 35 hours to take care of all of his dogs. The answer is: 35."
