Let's assign values to our variables based on what was provided in the original problem: m = initial score rate (4 points per minute), b = base value (x=0 and y=4), m(20+0) = 25% increase (increased rate during the last 20 minutes).

Let's rephrase our original question to account for the time period (the first half hour): In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. And in the second half hour, Mike scored 33.3% more points. What is the final answer?. Now we're going to work it backwards: 33.3% more points means that the sum of all points scored during those 40 minutes is 100/66 (100% / 66%) as large as the sum of points scored only during the first half of the match (the one without the additional points). Let's multiply both sides by 100/66: Total points = 4 * 100/66. This equals about 52.8 (approximately 53). The answer is: 53 points. The way I came up with this result is as follows. First, Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Because Mike scored 4 out of every 12 possible matches during this time span, and the average player (who has nothing else) scored 1 point per minute throughout their entire career, we can conclude that the average player scored 36 total points in those same 40 minutes before earning any more bonus points via bonus rounds or special abilities like being able to jump over enemies and obstacles at high speed . Thus, given an extra 15 seconds per level , Michael achieved 62 extra points compared to everyone else . This equates to an average score during regular matches plus the bonus obtained by playing faster than everybody else . Therefore Michael earned at least 300 points if you take into account all matches played so far including those played with 2 seconds remaining and counting towards victory rather than just when he gets hit by something or loses his turn because another opponent attacked him first while he was still alive but not yet finished fighting them off; since he managed to survive past round 3 which has been previously proven difficult enough that even elite players cannot beat consistently without some luck involved due mainly because this game requires precise timing along with great reflexes as well as perfect coordination between all units (including yours).
