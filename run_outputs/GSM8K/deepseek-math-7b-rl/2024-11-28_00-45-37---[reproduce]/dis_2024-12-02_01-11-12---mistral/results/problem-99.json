Next, we need to calculate the number of potted plants that Mary gave away. From the problem statement, we know that Mary gave one potted plant away from each of the 40 window ledges in her home. Using this information, we can compute the quantity 40\u22c51, which equals 40. Finally, we need to subtract the number of potted plants that Mary gave away from the initial number of potted plants in order to obtain the remaining number of potted plants: 98 \u2212 40 = 58.

Finally, since we want to give one plant away from each window ledge, which is 40 such ledges, this means giving $40 \\times 1 = 40$ plants away. Therefore, the remainder number of plants she has at the end will be 98 - 40 = 58. Therefore, the answer is 58.",

In conclusion, it appears that Mary will be holding onto $58$ potted plants! I hope this helps and happy solving \ud83e\udde0",

        " plants Mary already had - this is the 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges or 2x40=80. Add those to the number of new ones received yesterday (18). The grand total = 80+18 = 98. To determine how many of the plants will be left over after gifting some away, use the same expression of 2 per shelf, but subtracted out from the grand total. This results in 80(2 per window ledge)-2x18 or 80-36= 44 remaining. The answer is 44, we rounded it off a bit. Hope this helps!",
        " per ledge and there are 40 ledges, 2 x 40 = 80. Then calculate how many plants she already gave away. Since she is giving one plant away from each ledge, she will give away a total of 40 plants. 80 - 40 is 40 plants. That's it! Mary will keep 40 plants \ud83d\ude09",

Then remove the 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. This leaves you with (80 + 18) - (40 * 1). Expanding this and simplifying it gives you (80 + 18 - 40) / 1, which comes to 38.
