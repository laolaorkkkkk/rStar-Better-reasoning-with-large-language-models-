But it takes more than one train-mile to get from San Rafael to the end of their journey! We can calculate this distance using a simple formula: total distance / (no. of train-miles traveled) = average speed (in miles per train-mile). Here, 150 / (160 / 2) = 5 mph, meaning that our trains traveled at around 5 miles per hour when they weren't moving together as part of a train caravan going westward across America during World War II! That works out to 260 train-miles covered in two full days by each train, making our answer 260 for each train individually. If your first instinct was just trying out some other numbers like maybe adding 40 miles or doubling it but getting stuck because you couldn't solve for the value inside these parentheses yet then go ahead try again with this approach below before moving on: (number of train-miles traveled)/total distance=average speed (in miles per train-mile). Doing this means taking our total distance (320) divided by our number of trains (2). This equals about 5 hours spent driving westward on day one followed by another 5 hours spent driving 80 miles north eastward along Route 50 on day two resulting in a combined total travel duration over three segments equaling approximately 20 hours.

From here we can figure out what each 'leg' is because we already know that if one side (here a+b) adds up to 160 then the other (here c) would also be 160 but add up to 320 instead so our final equation becomes: c\u00b2 = 2(a+b)\u00b2.

Hence, the square of the hypotenuse can be computed as follows: c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 80\u00b2 + 150\u00b2 = 8000 + 22500 = 30500. Lastly, the value of c can be found using the formula: c = \u221a30500. Since we know that 'c' here represents the total combined distance traveled by both trains (from starting point to finishing point), it would be calculated as \u221a30500. The answer is: \u221a30500.",
        " = 6400 + 22500 = 28900. Hence, the hypotenuse of this triangle represents the distance travelled by each train during the two journeys. Thus, each train covered a distance of \u221a28900 miles = 171.70864131 miles. The answer is: 171.70864131.",
        " distance traveled by each train: eastward for 15 miles, southwestward for 65 miles, and then straight southward for another 180 miles. Since both went the exact same distances, let's just write it down as \"distance = 15 + 65 + 180 = 250.\" The distance covered each day is therefore: Day 1=250/2 and Day 2=250/2. The answer is: 125, 125.",

        " the sum of distances covered in the first and second days. First day distance is covered by going Westward, second day by going Northwards. First Day Distance=80 mi; Second Day Distance = (distance while traveling Northwards) + (distance traveled to return back from point North) = 80+80 = 160. Thus total distance covered in 2 days = 160+80 = 240. Divide this by 2, so we get distance covered by each train. So the answer is: 240 / 2 = 120 miles.",

        " or north-south. However, if the directions involved are changing like in cases involving acceleration or braking, it might not provide accurate results since the path would become curved rather than remaining linear. In such situations we may need to take into account the angle at which the train turns or the amount of acceleration/deceleration experienced along a track. But, the straightforward way here (i.e addition) seems appropriate since no angles were mentioned explicitly and hence makes sense.",
        " total distance traveled by both trains is 80 * 2 miles = 160 miles. On the second day, each train travels northward for 150 miles, so the total distance covered by both trains is 150 * 2 miles = 300 miles. Finally, we add these values together to get the total distance covered by both trains over the two days: 160 miles + 300 miles = 460 miles. This is the answer! I hope this explanation helped you better understand why $\\boxed{230}$ miles is the correct answer.",

On Day 1, they travel for 160 miles (still 80 per train), but now only 80 mi (160/2) overlap instead of none at all (this will matter later). On Day 2 they each travel another 80 miles again which means there is NO intersection this time. Thus we have to count 320mi of each train on D2 for the actual summation. To get the overall distance covered, we add the totals together as before which gives us 160 + 240 = 400 miles total. The answer is then $\\boxed{400}$."
