Let's subtract. 36-(12)=24 Therefore, 12 hours is one quarter the amount in hours. 36*4=12 is three quarters the amount in hours Therefore, 36 hours is one eighth the amount in hours. 36*2 = 6 is one sixth the amount in hours One third. 36*(2+2)= 12 is two thirds of the time. 36*3 is three fourths of the time. This is what we call \"percentages off\".  This is our percentage. Let's subtract one sixth of the time to see what it is really a sixth. 36-(4*2)=12 The rest is four sixths or two fourths. Three fourths is twice this. 36*(2*4)= 8 is four sixths. Two halves equals three quarters. 36*3 is three fourths.",

(15*4=60 hours).Jim read for 15 hours(15/2)*4 = 30 hours.Total:60+30 =90 hours.(60/90)*100= 66.67% of tv time.(15/30)*100=50% of time spent reading.",

        " half the time to read as it took to watch tv beforehand, so half of the total duration spent watching would equal how much time is spent during those sessions: 6/2. Since these sessions occur over four weeks, Jim watches and reads for 6 hrs x 3 readings per week x 4 weeks = 1.75 * 3 * 4 = 21 hours.",
        " this 3 times a week, this would mean he spends 1*3 = 3 hours reading each week. Therefore in total per week he spends 6+3 = 9 hours doing both things combined. For every month or 4 weeks (4 * 7) he spends 6 * 4 = 24 total hours doing just one activity and 3 * 4 = 12 total doing another adding up to: 36 hours which can be rounded off depending upon the precision desired",
        " activity takes up per week i.e.: (2+1/2)*2=3hours . Next calculate total weekly count by multiplying 3hours*4weekdays=12hours per week. Finally multiply it with 4 (number of weeks) thus getting our final solution which in this case equals:  12x4 = 48 hours spent on either TV or Reading every month .",
        " for one hour (2 hrs + .5 hr) by 3 visits/week for four weeks giving us a total of 8x12=96hr or almost 4.5day timeframe!. In conclusion Jim spends 96 hrs on both activities together during entire coursework period making his time spent 63% split into watching television show vs reading book(based upon assumption).",
        " it adds up to 6 hours per week. This means he watches 6*4 = 24 hours each week over the course of four weeks. He also read for half as long so Jim reads for 3 hours each time since he does this 3 times a week it adds up to 9 hours in total over the course of 4 weeks.

        " durations, etc except number of hours spent on TV and books so our equation would look like Hours spent on TV and books = (hours spent watching TV) (number of times Jim visits per week). Using this relationship, 2(Hours spent watching TV)(1.5 number of times Jim visits per week)=3(Hours spent on TV)(Number of times Jim visits per week). Here we can see that if hours spent watching TV was 1 then it would mean that the same time spent on books is going to be .5.  If you check these relationships against what they're supposed to describe (that every 2 hours watched equals one hour read), 2(1)(2)=1. So based off the equations we have solved for an unknown value and determined it was equal to its known quantity which means it must also apply elsewhere outside these specific circumstances which means that 3(x)(2)=1 or  2x=1/3 or x=1/6. This would imply that Jim has spent exactly half of his TV time devoted to reading.",
        " sum them all over entire period i.e., 8*3 = 24hours per visit* 4weeks. That being said note time units used for solution (i.e., hour). To calculate reading we use half value because we were told it's half duration relative first visit but again remember our final figure should be rounded to nearest decimal place when multiplied by 4 (i..e 24x4). Since both are equivalent terms then answer would look something like 10hr 30min. But what if it was 1 hour & 30 mins rather than 30 minutes only ? Well then you can just convert back into hours by dividing each minute by 60 followed by multiplying resultant quotient which yields fractional value around 0.59999\u2026..times 24 equals ~6hrs+49mins~6/1 hr=6Hrs; whereas dividing only one minuter will get same outcome because minutes don\u2019t add onto seconds unless they are explicitly stated otherwise e.g., 7 minutes equals 120seconds thus 5\u00d7360 divided by 60min=1hr",
        " Thus,  Jim spends 2 hours on TV per visit. Then he spends twice that time (because it is half as long) on reading. And both take place 3 times per week. This amounts to 2 plus 2 divided by two equals 2 plus 1 (hours spent on TV) times 3 times (visits made every week). Hence, Jim spends (total) seven hour(s) for television viewing every  week. Seven hours multiplied four times makes it 4+4=8 weeks altogether so his cumulative amount will add up to sixty eight hours!",
        " TV & reads for 21 Hours per week or ~3 Hours each session on average which equates into less than four working day worth effort/time spent overall (~1 Work week). It also means that Jim can afford himself almost five full days off every single year without spending too much time away from home assuming regular employment conditions apply across country.",
        " time spent we can easily find out the amount of time being spent watching tv and reading together each day so it becomes easier to determine the total for a month or week. Let\u2019s break down the question into smaller units - let's break it down into the week by week amount of time that would be spent on tv and reading each week. Since Jim spends 2 hours watching tv each day, he will spend 2hours * 3weekdays = 6hours per week total spending 2 hours watching tv. Likewise if jim reads for half as long or 1hour per visit to the tv station then it would be spent as follows, 1 hour spent per weekday. It would equal to 1hour * 3weekdays = 3 hours total amount of time spent during that week. The next week again would see the same pattern. This is true for every other week too! Let's find out what exactly jim spends each time he goes out on one visit and comes back home again after watching something special \u2013 I mean while watching those shows he might have stopped somewhere around them getting refreshments etc., which actually means extra time could be spent elsewhere outside those 2hr period spent inside watching stuff without any interruption (but still counting even for short intervals).",

        " answer. In our case if Jim spent 2hours while watching television then reading for same duration (half ) would mean that 3hours was spent on both activities which when multiplied by number of visits( 3) equals 9 hours. Similarly four weeks equal 4 x 7days=28days thus resulting in 28x 9hoursof time spended on tv and reading combined every week. This leads upto result which is simply 9x28 days or 252hours. The ",

        " And he reads for .5hrs.  We can easily calculate that, but to be fair here is what I did...  We know he is reading for .5 hr. But we need to multiply this number by 2 since it happens every time. The reason for this is when you say once per 2x's he is spending 2 hrs reading. This makes it equal (.5)x(2)=1.   Let us add the fact that he watches TV for a total of 2hrs each time he reads for 1 hr. That would mean he watches TV for 2*3=6hrs each week, and he reads for 1*3=3hrs each week. Now to find out the total after one month we need only multiply those numbers by 4.  6*4=24hrs. 3*4=12 hrs. Combine them together 24+12=36 total hours spent after a month. Hopefully this helps!",
        " on. Let\u2019s start with our first few steps. First we need to figure out what happens if Jim watches tv 2 hrs then reads for a half an hr, so it should look something like \u201c2hr+half an hr\u201d. I hope it looks right so far and make sense because Jim is watching tv and then reads for a half an hour. Well lets add 2 to one half (you may have noticed I am rounding off all the decimal numbers because it makes no difference really)and that gives us an answer that Jim spends three hours a day watching TV and then he spends half an hour on reading, so let\u2019s just round it down to three point five because why not! Next up our question asked us \u2018how many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks\u2019. It says it twice so i will repeat that again; \u2018how many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks\u2019. So that would mean 12. We find that by multiplying 3.5 x 4 which is equal to 12.5.  So now you know that your friend jims tv time takes up most of every day but hey thats what friends are for! They are here when we need them right?!",
        " friend! The answer is: 12 hours, which is 24 hours.",
        "hr watching tv and another 2 hr reading. This means 4 hrs per day. Times three days a week we get 3 x 4 hrs per day = 12 hours total in one week. So over four weeks he would watch 12 * 4 = 48 hours which is basically 4 days of solid watching. WOW !!!!!! JIM IS NOT GOOD AT CALCULATING TIME ????????????",
        " logic anyway and make it one hour since obviously there is a mistake here.... Now if Jim watches TV for 2 hrs. and reads for one hr and that totals three hrs which we then do 3 * 2weeks= 6 hrs and lastly we do six hours x 4 week=24.  Soooooo the answer is 24 hours.",

        " per week in order to know what that same ratio would be when applied over four weeks. The formula for finding an average or mean value (of anything really) is taking ALL the values divided by TOTAL of all values together which means we divide our total tv viewing time by the whole duration i.e.: ( 2x2 )/4(2X2)=8 right ?? This gives us our result as 3:1 ratio meaning three hours spent with tv viewing activity vs one hour spent reading books instead. Next let s figure how many hours jimmy would read during four weeks since according to question above he does it daily twice every single day ?! Aha so simple now isn t it?! We just multiply number 2x2 by number four (which equals eight)...and voil\u00e0 !! The answer is thirty minutes per session or thirty six mins total ! Happy learning buddy :) All good things come in time :)",
        " which is one hour so he spends 3 hours total watching TV and reading. Now we need to figure out how many days per week he does this. You said 3 days per week so thats what I put down too....hope it's right! Anyways let's see if these calculations work out..",
        " if we use the same variable for reading (hours) which should equal 1hr. Jim goes through these steps 3 times a week which would mean he can read and watch TV for up to 3x = 6hrs every week... And since one week consists of 7days, we can divide 6hrs/week by 7days to find out what fractional amount (as a decimal ) we should get per day = 6hrs divided by 7days equaling 0.85hrs.  If we do this 4 weeks in a row, it means Jim will spend ( 6 * 4 ) = 24 hours doing these tasks in 4weeks..  The answer is: 24.",
        " example with our assumptions anyway.   If Jim watches 2 hr on tv he will read .5 * 2 =1 hr. If he watches this three times per week that would be 3*1 hr = 3 hrs/week or (3*7)21hrs/mth or (21/4)=5.25hrs/week for four weeks. Thus, Jim watches (2*5.25)=10.5hrs/wk and reads(.5hr)*5.25wks=2.6hrs/wk for four weeks. Hope this helps clarify.",
        " seriously...if it equald .5hr than Jim is watching tv for 1 hour and reading 1 hour. SO, in 4weeks times 3days(tv and read) equaling 12times a month. Or 12x2 (tv)=twenty four hourz of TV time for all three months. and 12X1 (reading)=12hours of reading time for all three months. Thus totaling upto 36 hours of viewing TV and reading a whole 36 hours over the 3month period. Which equals up to eleven point seven five hours of daily combined reading and viewing time!!! WOOP!
