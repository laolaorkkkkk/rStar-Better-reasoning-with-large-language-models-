Since it comes out to be just 60/2 for the entire day's worth of meals that Wendi has provided so far means she still needs some 20(cups)\u00d73(meals)=60 cups total per flock member per day; adding 60 cups to what's already been fed adds up only enough feed until sunset meaning at nightfall wendy will want enough extra kibbles left over from when the lights went down since they don't usually eat at night time yet this doesn't require them going without any sustenance whatsoever during darkness. Therefore, we can conclude our calculations using whatever data points were given as evidence against other answers which might appear logical but prove incorrect after closer inspection",

With this we can say each member requires exactly one cup remaining after all others had been provided their appropriate portion(s), leaving us wanting five more extra ones just like before however due to rounding errors resulting from divisions taken too early without proper considerations about precision levels these numbers may not reflect an exact value but instead serve as approximations only slightly off from actual ones given similar enough context overall though still within acceptable ranges most times around! The answer is: 40.",
        " about earlier quantities then let me say again plainly yet surely that once you realize you are not concerned specifically concerning any particular timespan nor duration over which said requirement holds true (or even necessarily when said feed would most likely be consumed) but solely focused upon WHAT additional amount should one prepare FOR THIS TIMEPERIOD ONLY \u2013 no matter HOW MANY MEALS IT IS SPLIT AMONGST OR OTHERWISE HANDLED IN PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE-you can easily ascertain how much must still be allocated towards fulfillment upon completing any such task successfully\u2026",

Since Wendi has not stated how much is in the third meal yet, lets just say she uses the same measurements as before and divides the feed into three equal parts, meaning that in the third meal each chicken can only eat 20/20 which equals 1 cups of feed in one serving. Therefore, to cover 20 chickens in the third meal using only one cup per chicken the whole flock would require 20 cups.  To summarize, Wendi needs to make sure that her flock receives one cup per chicken every time it is fed. In total Wendi would need 60 cups of feed a day in order to accomplish this, since she already provided the equivalent of 20 cups of feed, the last feeding of the day only requires 40 cups of food or 20 cups per feeding in order to account for the entire chicken population.

Of this Wendy has already provided 25 cups of feed in the afternoon leaving only (45-25) or 20 cups of feed needing to be distributed among the chickens for supper. Since each chicken consumes one cup of feed the chickens would get 20/(20) or 1 cup each of feed for supper. The answer is 1 cup.",

        " I know what you\u2019re probably thinking but really there aren't anymore than 60 chicken feedings so any further amounts will be superfluous hence why I am suggesting merely 20 cups extra be necessary instead of say 15 which obviously wouldn\u2019t have sufficed due to being underestimated whereas the recommended 25 serves perfectly fine given its near perfect accuracy when compared against expected requirements (in this case).

We also know the amount of food Wendi has given each chicken so far is twenty-four , which means we need to find an equation relating these variables like this .  (24=X*3). Solving for X yields X=(24\u00f73)=8 , meaning that Wendi will need 24 cups total or 8 times what she currently has available! Finally , because each chicken needs a third ounce at dinner time as well , 8X+8=36 cups ! The answer is: 24 cups of food per day.",

Thus, it remains 60-70=-10 cups short! Hence, the last serving needs to contain -10 cups (- as negative numbers are used to indicate subtraction here). That means Wendy needs to make 10*20=200 cups of chicken feed, in order to give everyone one cup at dinner time. So the correct answer to your question would be 'two hundred', as in \"Wendy needs to make two hundred cups of chicken feed...\".",

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, she needs 9 / 3 x 20 = 60 cups of food total per day. This means if each chicken only receives 25 cups total per day, there would be an unaccounted for 30 cups of feed left over at the end of the day. To resolve this discrepancy, all that needs to be done is make the size of the last feeding larger than the previous two so that the cumulative 3 * 25 cups equals the needed 60 cups at the end of the day.",

In this case, there are 5 feedings in one day, so you have to multiply each feeding by 5 to get the total number of cups eaten each day. We add up what the chickens ate that day: 5 cups in the morning plus 5 cups in the afternoon and finally the evening 5 cups . So that makes a grand total of 15 cups of feed eaten in a day . It turns out that the question here is basically about how many chickens are left to feed, or which can also be phrased as asking \"how many chicken have yet to eat feed\". The next thing that we know about these animals - other than their number being fixed at 20 - would come out if we took the total food needed (3x20) divided by the amount available daily (5x15) , or 15 divided by 5.
