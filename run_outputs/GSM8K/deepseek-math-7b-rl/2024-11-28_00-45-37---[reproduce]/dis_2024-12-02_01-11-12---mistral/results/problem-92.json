        " A = J + 5. So now we have 2 equations (the other one is already mentioned). They are A = J + 5 and C = J+1. The only thing that needs to change about the first equation is to replace A with its value. So it becomes J = C - 5. Now we just need to combine them and solve for J. We get: J = C - 5, J+1 = C. Substitute J = C-5 into the second equation and then subtract J+1 to make all variables appear on the right side of the equal sign. I did this by adding C-5+1 on both sides of the equal sign to get rid of J. Then I substituted the value of J (which I just found in the first equation) for C-5 to finish it off. I got 5*C-1 = 0, so I divided both sides by 5 to simplify things, giving me C/5 - 1/5 = 0, finally solving for C. Once we find out what C is we simply add back 5 and 1 to find out Jackson's age. C/5 = 1/5 + 20, or 21 if using integers instead of fractions, so J = 16 years old!",

It is (Corey - James) - Jackson = Corey - Jackson - James = 11 - Jackson - 1 = 10 - Jackson. From Amy's position, we also can tell that Corey is Amy's senior. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson must be 10 - 5 = 5 years old. By plugging this value into our equation about the distance between them and solving it, we get (Corey - Corey - Jackson - Amy) = Corey - Amy - Jackson = 11 - 10 - Jackson = 1 - Jackson = Corey - Jackson = 1.

In other words, Jackson is 2 years younger than Amy. Since Emily only has four children, Corey is either Emily or someone else's child. Since Emily is the mother, then Corey must be Emily. Jackson must not be Emily since James is one year younger than him. Therefore, Jackson can be none but Emily and James. The rest can be assumed to be none of them. Jackson must be none but the son of one person among Amy, Emily, Corey, and James. All children have at least one parent, so their father or mother must be among the remaining three people; otherwise Jackson cannot exist. Therefore, Jackson is none but the son of either Amy or Emily. As the elder sibling is older than the younger sibling(s), James must be younger than Corey. This is why Amy, which is two years younger than Jackson, cannot possibly be the mother of Jackson. Since the mother of Jackson cannot be the youngest, she would not be James. Similarly, the mother of Jackson is neither Amy nor Corey. This leaves Corey as the only one who could be Jackson's mother. Therefore, Jackson's mother is Corey. His father must then be James since James is one year younger than him. To conclude, Jackson is the son of Corey and James.",

In our case though I think because there are more specific numbers involved here it should technically follow standard convention when dealing with numerical data meaning negative numbers denote being subtracted while positives signify adding therefore indicating Jacksons age must indeed be lower than Corys given their relationship dynamics outlined earlier. Therefore using division operator:(Jackson-Cory)/2=(-2)-(-1)=-1 which means Jackson is 1 year younger than Cory and hence his age would have to be calculated by adding said result back onto what we already have (-2) resulting in: -1+(-2)=-3.

Jackson minus 2 minus 2 is equal to Amy plus 2 plus 2 and minus 4 simplifies to Jack minus 4 equals Amy or we can write Jack minus 4 equals amy.

        " one year younger than Corey who is 11 he was 10 JAMES IS 10 YEARS OLD Since Jackson is 2 years younger than Amy who is 9, He is seven years old. JACKSONS AGE IS 7 YEARS JACKSON IS SEVEN YEARS OLD THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS 7 THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS 7!",
        " Therefore, James is only one year younger than Corey and Amy is three years younger than both Jackson and James. Thus Jackson must be fifteen minus three which would be twelve. TWELVE Years JACKSON IS TWELVE YEARS Old Jackson Is Twelve Years Old",
        " Amy would be 11-2=9 years old. This means Jackson being Amy's older brother is 11-9=2 years old. That makes him Nine JACKSON IS NINE YEARS OLD and Amy being his younger sister must be 9 minus the difference Jackson had when comparing their ages. Meaning Amy is seven SEVEN YEARS OLD since Emily's son Jackson is 2 years old. This means Amy is 2 plus seven SEVEN YEARS OLD hence making Jackson SEVEN YEARS OLD JACKSON IS SEVEN YEARS OLD",
        " (j) is 10 years old and that we can represent ages with j as J=10 this statement will allow us to solve for other ages let\u2019s continue with Jackson Jackson (J)=? since Jackson is younger than Corey C which is also 10 so adding one year would mean 11 so Jackson (j) is equal to eleven (11) James James is 2 years younger than Corey (C) because coreys age minus James age (j) equals ten (C-j)=10 because c=corey is 10 years old this represents another equation James equals ten minus two making James age zero so James j=10\u22122 and Jackson j= 11 is greater than James so James J is younger than Jackson j = 11 Amy is two years older than James so we add two years on top (A+2) of J\u2019s age making Amy two years older than James or 11+2=13 years old which makes it so that Jackson is three years younger than Amy making the math problem (a-j)=3 which works out with a=(13-3)=(10) Jackson j=(13-3)-1)(2) so Jackson (J) is 10 years old. The answer is: 10.",
        " We also know that Jackson is 5 years older than Amy but 2 years younger than Corey. Let\u2019s add up all those numbers. Jackson - Amy = Jacksons Age \u2013 A. James \u2013 Corey = C. (Corey+A) \u2013 (Corey \u2013 James) = (Amy + 5). From this we get Corey + 2 = 11. Therefore Corey is 9. This means Amy must be seven. Now let\u2019s take Jackson \u2013 Corey + Amy = 10+7 which results in 17 meaning Jackson was 17 at that time. But since you said he was 15 we subtracted 17 \u2013 15 leaving us with only two, which means Jackson is two years old. The answer is: two.",
        " that Amy must be only 9 years old because 11-2=9. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson so what we need to find out is Jackson age. Because Amy was 9 and Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy he would be 4 years old since 9-5 equals 4.",
        " Jackson that we can put numbers in place such as 9+5 which results in 14 meaning AMY IS 14 YEARS OLD ANSWER Now we can add up all ages adding up Emily has 4 kids she said that this is Amy Jackson Corey and James right? So when you add all those numbers up you get 14+15+11+10 resulting in a total sum of 40. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us the last two letters names are. And even after using multiple letters or names from the list it comes back and says \"this name was already used\", therefore it only uses Jacksons name from the list."
