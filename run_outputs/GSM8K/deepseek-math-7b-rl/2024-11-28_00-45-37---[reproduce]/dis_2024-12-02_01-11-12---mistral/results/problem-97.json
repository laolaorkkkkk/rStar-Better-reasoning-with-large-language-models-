The other six tomatoes were therefore cooked away. So 12 minus 6 means 6 tomatoes disappeared. And these six tomatoes equal 3 times 6, or a total of 18 tomatoes disappeared into the sauce.

Since 32 ounces represent a full serving size, this means that we need to multiply by that fraction again in order to determine how many cans we used for our 32 ounces: `(3/8) x (32/1) = 16`.

Last step is simple division which reveals us exactly how many tomatoes were needed before cooking began: 64/3 = 22 64/3 divided by 21 yields roughly the same result.

And we know that it is NINE tomatoes not twelve!!!! Remember, the answer is \"nine\"! (In case it wasn't clear enough): When mashing 4 separate groups of tomatoes together along with other ingredients\u2014let's assume there weren't any non-tomatoe ingredients at all so the tomatoes get mixed completely and perfectly without leaving behind any chunks of anything else\u2014then all of our NINE ORIGINAL THOUGHT TOMATEOS become ONE GROUP OF SINGLE NEWLY MASHED TOMATO EQUATIONALLY EQUIVALENT IN SIZE TO ALL THE OLD ONES!! Therefore, counting only those present in our new mix could lead us down paths leading nowhere since dividing anything up by itself doesn't change anything!! Instead focus instead upon considering what happened BEFORE dividing anything into separate groups i e looking at just the beginning situation before doing anything with those objects and calculating the answer according to rules which govern real life. Now that we know this rule it can also help explain why adding another object like spices wouldn't affect results: Adding spices won't add more objects but rather they will be incorporated with the existing ones thus maintaining number balance between objects present while also changing properties associated with both groups individually\u2014but keeping same overall composition",
