        " to go to the movie, we take the amount he has and divide it by how much he would be spending each trip (i.e., 42/14). Thus we get that 42 divided by 14 gives us 42-14 = 3. Because 14 is fully divisible into 3, this means Peter could go 3 times per week (and there aren\u2019t any other whole numbers which satisfy the criteria). Therefore, option B is our correct answer choice!",
        " days ($7 per day). In other words: $42/7 = 6 times which means that peter could attend the movies up to 6 times without exceeding the available funds. Consequently, the correct response here is option b \u2013 Six.",
        " throughout said period seems optimal! Therefore we conclude choice A Is correct (or alternatively put ;P) because Peter only needs 6 trips instead of 5 which saves him another dollar worth spent getting more entertainment compared others might choose when choosing C option instead...",

        " to the movie theater . If we add up the cost of the ticket ($7) and popcorn($7), this equals out to be 14$ Each time he goes. To find out how many times Peter can go, we have to divide 42 by 14. We get 3 since this equals out to be the remainder when we divide by 14.",
        " his total cost per trip to the movies is $14. With 42 dollars in his wallet, he could go to the movies 42 / 14 = 3 times (remember, you can use long division if this is confusing). So option 3, B, is correct.",
        " Now, since Peter has $42 for the whole week we can divide this amount by $14 meaning he can afford to go $42\u00f7$14= 3 times a week. The answer is: 3.",
        " week, we first divide $14 into $42, which results in $42/$14\u2248$3. Next, we add one to the resulting quotient, or $3+$1=$4. So if we assume Peter plans to use the pass three times per week and the cost remains constant over this time period, Pete will be able to visit $4\u00d73=$12 movie(s) before having to pay full price for his admission/popcorn combo. Therefore, since we see the word \u201cthis\u201d in line two, we expect the number of movies Pete can attend for $0 this week based upon the aforementioned variables described above\u2014which leads me back to my original statement about choosing between choice (C) and Choice (B). It really comes down to personal interpretation regarding whether or not there could potentially be any additional scenarios that fall outside these parameters within which our hero might find himself unable to make use of his cinema pass without paying up front rather than taking advantage of what would otherwise seem like an amazing deal!",

        " movies. When he buys a ticket it costs him 7 dollars plus another 7 dollars for the popcorn so he is spending a total of 14 dollars each time he goes. If Peter only wants to spend up to 42 dollars, he would need to find the biggest factor of 42 without going over 14. The factors include 1, 2, 3, and 6 but they also include 7 which happens to be the largest while still fitting under our condition of 14 dollars. This tells us the number of times Peter can go to the movie before going over his 42 dollar budget. The answer is: 3",
        " $7 for popcorn. This means he spends a total of $14 each time he goes to the movies. With the information that he has $42 dollars for the week and needs to plan how many times he goes to the movies. This means he will need $14 * X dollars to go X times to the movies. This makes X equal to 42 / 14 which simplifies to three. Therefore, Peter can only go to the movies 3 times. Option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because the problem states that Peter has $42 and needs to figure out how many times he can go to the movies. We cannot tell if there are any other expenses that Peter has before we know how many times he will go to the movies. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer as the scenario changes slightly from what is stated within the prompt. Similarly, option C is incorrect as well since we do not know how much Peter spends on anything outside of going to the movies such as food or snacks during the movie. We also do not know how often Peter might choose to go to the movies. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer either.",
        " a total of $14 per visit. To determine how many visits Peter can make with his allotted budget of $42, you simply divide $42 by $14. This means he is able to see one movie using all of his allocated funds.",
        " since C is less than 10. It's clear B is greater than 2 because when we subtract the two numbers, we only get a remainder of 1 . Therefore B is equal to three since it can only divide into 2 without leaving any remainder. Since we also know C and B is one of our two factors we subtract the smaller B (3) from our bigger factor A (10). We would get 7 which means the last factor is seven. Therefore B=3 , A=10 , and C=7",
        " correct answer because it has the least steps needed. We need to get through all the examples, but we still might need a few more. It depends on whether we run into C or not. So let us assume C comes up and we need to finish 21 examples. I can see myself getting into the middle and realizing that my method didn\u2019t work so we will just try all three again. B took the least steps of them all to solve it, while A was very similar but had one extra step which was taking the modulus twice. C was even worse, but it only comes up half of the time. If C came up the other half of the time (meaning it got the same amount of examples), then we would switch to A as the best approach, but this doesn\u2019t happen, so I don\u2019t need to calculate it as such. Let\u2019s start with B again...",
        " this question in a similar way Let's look again at the table of numbers we made earlier and pick out the ones we need to subtract from our original number of tickets And let's work backwards starting with the second last line since it has the largest change value This means that we will subtract 80 from our original number of tickets to get 226 tickets We repeat the same for the first number We subtract 40 from our original number of tickets We then subtract 70 so that we now have 196 tickets Left over Finally we subtract 25 which leaves us with 171 tickets left The answer is: 171 tickets left The answer is: 171 tickets left.",
