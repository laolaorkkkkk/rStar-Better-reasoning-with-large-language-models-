All together we have Jan's 3 x M pets, Marcia's M+2=M+2 pets, and Cindy's M-2 pets. 3 x M + M + 2 + (M-2) = 3 x M + 3, but you can see it really depends on what M is. Let's try M = 4. That would make Marcia have M = 4 pets. Thus Jan has 3 x 4 = 12 pets, Cindy has 2, and Marcia has 4. Now our equation becomes 12 + 4 + 2 = 18. If Marcia has 6 instead, then Jan has 18 pets, Cindy has 4, and Marcia has 6. Now our equation becomes 18 + 6 + 4 = 28. If Marcia has 8 instead, then Jan has 24 pets, Cindy has 6, and Marcia has 8.

        ". Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Marcia has one third of Jan's number of pets. Let's call the number of pets Marcia has m. So m = 1/3 * jan's pets. Then it can be rewritten into an equation like this (m=1/3*jan's pets). We can also write another equation using Cindy. Since she has 4 pets, her pet count is equal to 4. And since she has two fewer pets than Marcia, let's call her pet count n. It can be represented by 4=n-2. Using these two equations, we can use substitution or elimination to figure out what m equals to. We will use substitution here. m=1/3*jan's pets is equivalent to 1/3*(cindy's pets), since they both represent the same value for m. Then we can substitute n-2 instead of cindy's pets. (This means when you substitute something you already know, it just gets simpler and easier.) Then we have an equation where the right hand side has only one variable which is easy to solve! Solving the equation yields m=18. So marcia has 18 pets. Cindy has four pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore Jan has 3x18 = 54 pets. In total the three people have 54+18+4 = 76 pets. The answer is: 76.",

Now finally, if the three of them have their own separate totals like that, and all together they are sharing these pets, it makes sense that Marcia's pet count should not be included twice in the grand total when adding it up. That's why I subtracted the number of pets Marcia has from 18, to make sure we don't include her twice in our summation. So all three of them put together, you would say: Jan has 18 pets, Marcia has 6, and Cindy has 4.

Adding up all of these numbers shows that Jan and Cindy combined have 22 pets (4 + 18), while Marcia has 6 pets herself.

And we know that if Cindy has 4 pets, then Jan must have 4 less than that, so 3(x+2) - 4 = 2x + 6. We could solve for x, but let's instead use the information about Marcia having two more pets than Cindy. Cindy has 2 pets more than Marcia has, so 3(x+2) - 4 = 2(x + 2), or 3x + 6 = 2x + 8, meaning x=4. Plugging in x=4 into our first equation, we get 3(x+2) - 4 = 2x + 6.

Additionally, Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, meaning she has a total of X+2 pets.

We divide by 4 on both sides to get X=1. Because Marcia has 1 pet and Cindy also has 4, and Jan has three times as many as Marcia, Jan will have 3x1=3 pets total.

        " them. Let's start with Jan. Since she has three times the number of pets as Marcia, we can represent this mathematically by saying Jan has 3p, where p represents the number of pets Marcia has. And since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, this means that p + 2. Lastly, we know that Cindy has four pets, so let's say c equals 4. We have one last equation to add, which is the total number of pets among the three people, which would be 3p + p + 2 + c. Now we can substitute our values and solve for p. 3p + p + 2 + c = 4 4p + 2 = 4 4p = 2 p = 1/2. Now that we have p, we can plug it into our other equations to find the number of pets for the other people. Jan has 3(1/2) = 3/2 pets, Marcia has 1 + 2 = 3 pets, and Cindy has 4 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets among the three people is (3/2) + 3 + 4 = 13.",
        " know Jan has thrice as many pets as Marcia so Jan has (3*Marcia's pet count) + 4 for her own pets, which means if we multiply Jan's number by 3 again we'll get Marcia's pet count! This leaves us with this equation: 3*(Jan+4)=total_pets Since jan has 4 pets herself add 4 into parentheses on both sides of our equation: 3*(Jan+4)+4=total_pets Simplify! Using distributive property we can move the 4 outside of the parenthesis to show this: 3*Jan+3*4=total_pets Then apply distributive property again to finish simplifying: 3*Jan+12=total_pets Next subtract both sides by 12 because it's equal on both sides of the equation. This will remove \"the constant term\" from one side so only variables remain: 3*Jan=-12 Divide both sides by -3 since negative signs on either side cancel out (remember sign rules): 1/(-3)*(3*Jan)=(-12)/-3 Now reverse distribute property to flip this equation back into the original format: -Jan=4 Reverse distribute property to finish solving for X: -x=4 Now let's solve for x by negating this statement and moving all terms over to one side before applying rules on exponents (if needed) !!!!! Don't forget your rules like adding negative exponents etc. !!: 0=(x)-4 To solve for X isolate the variable by adding the same number or equation to each side: (x)-4+4=X -12=0 Now we can use zero property rule since -12 is 0: true Solving -12=true would mean there isn't actually any solution here unless maybe you want the solution set {inf} depending on what kind of algebra class it was supposed to be in :) Anyways... We could also stop when 12 is 0 because then it's simply telling us Jan's amount is undefined and doesn't exist. There is no such thing as infinity minus anything else in Math! But since I already wrote all this out let me continue lol: (x)-12=true And finally solve for X by dividing by minus 12 again: X= -",

Therefore Marcia has 8 pets. We know that Jan has 3x the amount of pets as Marcia, therefore if Jan has 8 pets she would have 3*8 = 24 pets. Now that we know how many pets Jan has, let's find out how many pets all three people have. There are eight pets belonging to Marcia, four belonging to Cindy, and twenty-four belonging to Jan. Together they have thirty-two pets. The answer is thirty-two.",
        " Cindy, so we can calculate Marcia's pet count using this simple equation (Cindy's pets + 2). This makes it so that if Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia also has 4 pets because their numbers differ by exactly 2. Next we will multiply this figure, which represents both Jan's and Marcia\u2019s collective number of furry friends, by three. To do this we simply take our original result 6 (from Cindy having 4 pets) and multiply it by 3 since Jan's pet count should equal three times that amount in order to solve correctly . At this point you have all the information necessary to get your desired result which is 18! So 18 total pets exist between these three individuals when counting only animals under each name individually; however if one looks beyond those listed here additional numbers could appear due unnamed entities residing elsewhere within their environment such as birds or fish swimming nearby etc..",
        " 2 = 6 pets. Knowing that Jan has triple the amount of pets as Marcia, it is easy for us to deduce that Jan has triple six, or 18 pets. Adding together all three girls pets yields a total count of 28. The answer is: 28.",

Adding the three values together provides the sum of how many pets the three individuals have. 6 + 18 + 4 = 28 pets, which is our final answer. Jan has 18 pets. Marcia has 6 pets. Cindy has 4 pets. The three of them have a total of 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 pets.",

Multiply whatever marks numbered 6 pets from before by the number thirteen again.. this yields a result of 78 pets, but the question asks you how many total.. We dont know how many pets cindy or jan have individually only marcia so her pets are counted twice.. Thus in order to find our correct total we must subtract the pets owned by marcia.. since we know it is 6 pets to do this we simply take the total of 78 subtract 6 which gives us a final sum of 72 petss.. The answer is: 72.",
