So there were 140 rubies and therefore 2*140=280 emeralds. Since the three types of stones are all different, we can say that the sum of diamonds plus rubies plus emerals is the total. This sum is 175+140+280=605.  So the three groups together make 605 items and each group is one third of that total. One-third of 605 is 201 (=605/3). Therefore, the three groups together total 201 items. There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds and there were 280 emeralds. So the total was 280+140 = 420. This is 420 minus the already counted 35 rubies which makes the total number 385(=420-35) items. Dividing that by the previously found total of 605 gives us 385/605 ~= 65%.",

We can solve this equation for rubies like this: We know that if there was 2 * Ruby, it would mean there were the same amount of rubies and emeralds. This means we can subtract the known amounts from both sides to get 2 Ruby = Emeralds. Because we now only care about finding how many emeralds there are, we want to solve for emeralds. So let's subtract 2 Ruby on both sides: 2 Ruby - 2 Ruby = Emeralds - 2 Ruby. And this becomes Emeralds - 2 Ruby = 0. So we subtract Ruby on both sides again and we get Emeralds - Ruby = -2 Ruby, which we can simplify into just 2 Emeralds. So since there were twice the number of rubies than emeralds, this means there were twice 2 Emeralds which is 4 times the number of emeralds. So we need to add 2 Emeralds to itself 4 times: 2 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds = 4 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds = 6 Emeralds + 2 Emeralds = 8 Emeralds (simplify it down) Now we can finally use what we have learned so far. We know there were 2 * Emeralds = Ruby, and there were 140 rubies, so that means that there were 140 Ruby / 2 Emeralds = Emeralds, which is 70. So there were 70 emeralds.

We see that there exists $175+3x$ diamonds, $140-x$ rubies, and $(140-x)/2=70-x/2$ emeralds inside the treasure chest. Next, we sum the total number of stones present.

        " the amount of rubies as R = 175 - 35 = 140. Therefore, the number of emeralds (E) was twice the number of rubies. So E = 2 * 140 = 280. This means that there were 175 diamonds, 140 rubies, and 280 emeralds. So we need to sum up the numbers of all these three types of gems: 175 + 140 + 280 = 605. The answer is: 605.",

        " there must have been 35 more diamonds than rubies. Therefore, since there were twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, the number of emeralds was two times the number of diamonds, which is equal to four times the number of rubies. This means that if there were five hundred eighty five gems, the emeralds would be five hundred fifteen plus one hundred forty plus sixty five, or one hundred sixty seven emeralds.

        " there were 35 less rubies than diamonds, there must have been 35 * 35 = 1225. And since there were twice the number of emeralds as the number of rubies, this means 2 * 1225 = 2450 emeralds. Now we can find the total number of gems by summing up diamonds (175), rubies (1225), and emeralds (2450): 175 + 1225 + 2450 = 4000. The answer is: 4000.",

        " than diamonds, so there were 35 fewer rubies than 175. Let's set up an equation. (Number Of Rubies) = 175 - 35. (Number Of Rubies) = 140. We know that there was twice the number of emeralds than rubies. Therefore the number of emeralds is double the number of rubies. (Number Of Emeralds)=(two)*(140). Number Of Emeralds = 280. Thus we have 3 answers that are correct, but we need only one. Let's add up all three gem types together: (number of Diamonds) + (number of Rubies) + (number of Emeralds), which equals 175+140+280=595.. This is our answer...!!!. The number is 595. I say this because there are 595 gems in the treasure chest.",
        " R was also equal to twice the amount of emeralds, we can say that twice the number of emeralds is equal to R, or `2E = R`. Substituting our expression of R into our equation for it yields `2E = D-35`, which we can expand as `2E= D - 35`. To get E alone, we divide both sides by 2, which leaves us with: `E = (D - 35)/2` . Therefore, we substitute the value of 175 for D in the previous formula and obtain that E equals 265/2, or 132.5. This means that the treasure chest included 132 and a half emeralds. Additionally, we can find out the number of rubies by solving `R = D - 35`, which we can simplify further by substituting D= 175 into the equation: `R = 175 \u2013 35 = 140`. Thus, it turns out that the treasure chest contained 140 rubies. We can finally add up all the gem quantities together to find that the total number of gems in the chest was: 175 + 140 + 132.5 = 447.5 , or 448. We can conclude that the treasure chest contained approximately 5 hundred & 8 gems , which consists of One hundred seventy five diamonds alongwith one hundred forty Rubies aswellas one hundred thirty two & one half emeralds !!!"
