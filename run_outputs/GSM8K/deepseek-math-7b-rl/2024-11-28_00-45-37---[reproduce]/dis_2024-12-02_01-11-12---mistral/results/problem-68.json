This implies that there are also 60 boys and 5 students to every teacher. Finally, we multiply these quantities by g and b and add them together. This will give us the number of students per teacher, 5g+5b. Setting up the equation, (1)(5g)+(1)(5b)=120. Plugging the values for the two quantities into our equations, 5g+5b=120,2g=b. Using substitution we get 5(2g)+5b=120, which becomes 10g+5b=120. Lastly we use the other equation, 2g=b and plug it back in to simplify. Solving the equation, 10(2g)+5b=120. Substituting 5(2g), we get 5(2g)+5b=120, or 5(4g)+5b=120. Split it up, 5(2g)+5(2g)=120. Dividing by 2, 1(2g) + 1(2g) = 120/2, 2g+2g=60. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 1/2, 2g/(1/2) + 2g/(1/2)=60/.2, 4g+4g=300. Lastly, we subtract 4g from both sides, and solve for g. 4g=300, so g=300/4. Therefore, we have solved the last remaining variable, g. Now we plug it into one of the initial equations to solve for b. Solving our earlier equation, 5g+5b=120, we get 5(300/4)+5b=120, or 150+5b=120, 5b=30, b=6. Therefore the number of students to every teacher is 150+5b=120, or 5 times 6 plus 300 divided by 4,",

        " statements which was there are 60 girls now there are 120 girls we need to divide it into groups of 5. so 120/5=24 teachers The answer is: 24.",
        " out to be 180 5+T=9 now divide both side we get 5/9.5 =T So T equals 9/5=1.8 which means teachers are 1.8 students. The answer is: 2.",
        " given in question there is 60 girls so if it is boys the case will be (180-60) which we can write as 180-(60)=180-60=120 thus finally this problem can also be solved as follows. There are 120 boys at the school. It takes six boys per teacher so divide 120 by six which will become 20 teachers. The answer is: 20.",
        " we can get total no of teacher 180/5= 36 so we will divide 180 by 5 so total number of teachers will be 36. The answer is: 36."
