With enough dedication though who knows what amazing opportunities lay ahead...? Who else can say they've ever thought about making such good money off simple yet incredibly useful items like an egg?! I believe anybody willing enough could find success within their own fields if they just put their minds too it!!! It takes hard work sure but doesn't everything worth having always require effort?! Let's make Lloyd proud here folks & never shy away from whatever tasks lie ahead because remember nothing great was ever accomplished without taking risks first right??! So get out there people & start doing things no matter how intimidating they may seem cause who knows what might happen next ;) Good luck!!!

So now we know how many eggs Lloyd produces each week. Next, all we have to do is multiply by the price, and then multiply again by the number of days. The final expression becomes 2 x 21 x 7 = 294."
