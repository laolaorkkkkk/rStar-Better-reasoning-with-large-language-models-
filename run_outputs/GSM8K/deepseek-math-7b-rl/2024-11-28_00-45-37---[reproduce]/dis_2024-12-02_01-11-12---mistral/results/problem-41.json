When Polly holds the gemstone, the distance she can throw the javelin is therefore 3 x 400 feet = 1200 feet. This means she can throw the javelin up to a distance of 1200 feet. However, this still may not ensure killing the dragon since she needs the javelin to be able to travel further than the 1000 foot range the dragon breathes fire within. We can see that Polly cannot kill the dragon by throwing the javelin with the gemstone. Therefore, when Polly does not hold the gemstone, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. To kill the dragon, we want it to be thrown so that it goes past the 1000 foot range the dragon breathes. The answer is: 1000 feet, since we know that the 1000 foot range is what the dragon breathes within.",

Therefore, when throwing the javelin while holding the gemstone, she can aim it as far as 3 * 400 feet. This means that Polly can throw the javelin for a distance up to a maximum distance of 1200 feet away (1200 is 400 * 3). From this information, we know that Polly needs to stand further than 1000 feet from the dragon's mouth so as not to get roasted and to avoid being blown away by their hot breath which emanates outward 1000 feet. Thus, the answer is 200 feet (= 1200 - 1000), as Polly needs to stand 200 extra feet away from the flame so that the distance is greater than the radius where the dragon's breath would hurt her.",

It must be greater than 1000 feet and less than or equal to 1200 feet, since 1200 would block her from hitting the dragon.

We want to find the minimum possible distance outside of the range of the dragon's breath that Polly can stand, while still being able to throw the gold javelin to hit Perg. Therefore, she would first move to 900 feet. At that point, if the dragon breathes right towards her direction, she would also move back, towards the safety of Farbo, another 100 feet so that she can still throw the javelin.

We need Polly to position herself 1000 feet from Perg.  This means Polly needs to go forward the distance between 400 feet and 1000 feet. The distance is 1000 - 400 = 600 feet. Polly needs to go 600 feet from the dragon, while at most being able to throw at best 1200 feet. The answer is: 600.",

        " know that the javelin can reach twice that distance without the gemstone, the answer is somewhere between those distances. The range lies within 400 to 1200. Since this represents too wide of a range, let us narrow down our search. Given the fact that the dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet, the javelin should be able to travel at least a little less than 1000 feet. This would mean that the gemstone alone allows Polly to get around 600 feet further than normal (i.e. 1000 feet minus the normal distance without the stone). Thus, in order to satisfy this condition, Polly must use the javelin either once or twice while holding the gemstone. Since the javelin goes 3x as far when Polly has the gemstone, the first possibility would imply that Polly goes 1200 feet with the gemstone, and thus travels 400 feet further (i.e. 400 + 1200) than when not holding the stone. Since this value of 400 plus 1200 exceeds 1000, we may discount this as an option. The second possibility would allow Polly to go either half of 1200 feet (or) all of 1200 feet with the gemstone. However, when traveling just half of 1200 feet, we find that (600 / 2) = 300. Since 300 falls short of the required distance of 1000 feet by 700 feet, this option is also invalid. Therefore, the final possibility has Polly travel 1200 feet (and thus exactly double the distance) while holding the gemstone. As such, holding the gemstone allowed Polly to throw the javelin 1200 feet, which means that Polly can indeed throw the javelin beyond the range of the dragon's fiery breath, allowing her to slay the dragon.

First, if we assume that Polly is at 1000 feet, she would need to throw the javelin 200 feet farther than its normal throw without the gemstone. Since her throw increases from 400 to 1200 with the gemstone, we can subtract 1200 - 400 = 800 feet from the distance of 1000 to see how far from the dragon's flame Polly needs to be.

In other words, suppose Polly's distance from the dragon's flame is zero (or negative). That is to say, Polly wants to be exactly right at the edge of the dragon's breath. Therefore, since she can triple the throw's reach with the gemstone, she could throw the javelin up to 1200 feet away from herself, which is also 1200 away from the dragon's flame. Since Polly doesn't have the ability to throw past the flame's limits, this second scenario cannot happen. Based on these scenarios, Polly can safely stay at a distance from 600 to 1200 feet to avoid the dragon's flames, and throw the javelin further to successfully strike him. The answer is: 600~1200.",

        " javelin while holding the gemstone, let's take into account the range of the dragon's breath. Since they are both far away from the mountain, the distances Polly throws and the dragon breathes are pretty much comparable. So instead of doing (javelin distance + dragons breath) - (dragons breath), we are going to add the gemstones power multiplied by the same thing to get rid of the negativity, and subtract the gemstone power times half of the dragons breath, which will make it equal zero, resulting in (gemstone power + javelin distance) + (2/3 * gemstone power - 1/3 * dragons breath). Taking the values from before, and plugging them into our new equation, we find that when Polly holds the gemstone she can go ((3 * 400) + (400 * 3)) + (1/3 * 400) which equals 1600 feet from the dragon's breath. The answer is: 1600.",
        " so she can throw it three times farther. Three times 400 is 1200. This means that the maximum distance Polly could get to outside the dragon's reach was 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet. The answer is: -200.",
        " The reach of the dragon's flame is 1000 feet. At 1200 feet, she would just barely miss the dragon. Therefore, standing and throwing the javelin from 800 feet away will let her hit the dragon.

This means there is a maximum distance that Polly can stand away from the dragon before the javelin hits: 1000-400 = 600 feet. The answer is: 600.",

Smaller than 1200, 1100 works. Because we need to keep in mind the 400 feet required without the gemstone, 1100 feet minus the 400 feet makes 700 feet as our target distance. This means Polly needs to go (400 feet) / 3 = 133.33 feet further back from the edge of the range when using the gemstone.

Therefore, holding the gemstone would make for an ineffective attack against the dragon since hitting it would be impossible even if the javelin can be thrown that far.

This statement implies that Polly can still hit the dragon using gold javelin when holding a gemstone; thus she needs the range of 1200 feet to hit the dragon. And that was our required response!!  Thus, the answer is : Polly has enough range to hit the dragon.",

If standing within the area affected by the dragon, Polly cannot hit the dragon because the javelin would simply burn up as soon as it went close enough for the breath. The answer is: 1200 feet.",

This means if you add the distances, 400 + 1200, then that will be the distance Polly would need to be away from the dragon. 400 + 1200 equals 1600 feet.

Firstly  i\u2019d like point out few important observations based on what i mentioned above :-  1 > 400 is minimum distance one could throw from without getting roasted alive while trying take down biggest most ferocious beast ever existend .(which itself tells quite clear story abt why people are terrified enough never attempt confront him ).  2 > 2x2+1 = 1200 ft which represents farthest throwable distance(according math formula) assuming no external factors/constraints  applied.(i suppose u already get picture right?). Now since question asked maximum safety margin available before crossing red line drawn on map representing max limit range allowed for human survival ,its obvious enough see 1st number must reduced significantly otherwise nothing prevents us being burnt 2 deaf afterall\u2026..   Now if we multiply above equation again factor X ,i mean dividing whole thing with (3*1/4)=665ft (or slightly closer than 2x3+1=1218 ft ) we get answer thats correct according our criteria .However i cant help but wonder why didnt mention anything about weather condition affecting dragons abilities during cold winters etc\u2026.

You simply need to remember that if something that we're trying to figure out is equal to `cube root X`, that means you are going to find that value by `multiplying` the base of 3 (the symbol is `x^3`) and whatever digit we inputed into this. For example if we are finding out what is `x^3` when x=8. Well, lets think about that for a second..well if 8 x 8 x 8 is 512 and 512 divided by 3 is 170.333, so if our answer is going to be `170.333^3` or `root^3`, we have to do the following operations in order, we take 333.33 and cube root it again to get 10 which is our original number 8 x 8 x 8 which means our original question was 8^3 or 512. That means our answer is 170.333 and that means that our original question is the cube root of 512. To summarize it all up for you, you need to remember that if we cube the root then it is equal to multiplying by the base of 3. So yes, the answer is ten.

Well...we learned earlier it increases distance, so obviously further than before! The question states we can increase 400ft x3 , which means 400 x 3 which comes out to a whopping twelve hundred feet away! What would this mean? If she could now reach out twenty fifty ft (200 more than what she previously could). This takes us from one thousand feet back a bit to 800ft so basically, since she can now get 200 ft further with her throw with the gems, this means she will be able to stand 200 closer to the dragon.

Since there are only two possible outcomes here, I\u2019ll go ahead and assume both possibilities without specifying anything else beyond those specifics; thus meaning that all factors will always equal whatever was chosen for them earlier on during calculations .

        " twelve hundred feet.  That is the range. The question is what is the extreme edge of this range since Polly must throw beyond the 1000 feet mark. Since 2 is the square root of eight, we know that one hundred feet falls between 8 and 2 because it does not divide equally into four hundred and into one thousand.  One hundred feet is less than four hundred and less than one thousand and as such lies squarely in the middle of our two numbers, therefore representing an acceptable edge position. It has been said that 'if we add a negative to the square of any positive integer and multiply both sides by the original positive integer plus its negative reciprocal, we get a solution that has two different answers.' This is true and I believe that the square root of eight has provided us with exactly such a set of circumstances where 2 is our first solution. Therefore one thousand plus one hundred minus four zero (this last number comes about through division) provides us with another possible answer equal to fourteen hundred and ten feet.  As a result, when Polly holds the sapphire stone she can fling her javelin out anywhere between one hundred fifteen feet further than if she didn\u2019t hold it up while standing directly over mount Farbo\u2019s peak or a little short of eleven hundred feet away from the top of the mountain!",

If she is further out than 120 feet while holding the stone, there will always be enough extra space to keep her safe; thus it matters not how far away she is from the great one but that she stands far enough out so long as she holds the gem and is beyond four hundred eighty feet (that is, so long as she is far enough beyond this point).

You see that if she throws it a short distance with the sapphire, she can send it flying farther than she ever dreamed of sending a weightier shot, for it was no longer weight that carried the projectiles through the air but power and speed; a force unchecked and unrestricted by limitations of materiality; so that in short no distance was too great and no obstacles too large if she wielded the javelin correctly.

The question posed asks, `Polly may throw one hundred twenty five feet beyond (i.e., outside) the range of the dragon's flame'. Our next step is to subtract the original starting distance (four hundred) from the goal range (one thousand) which equals six hundred. Since this value was given without the units being provided (feet), we add them onto this value, thus six hundred sixty. Now that we have all the figures needed for working through the problem we begin. `A man walks at the rate of four miles per hour. In how long will he travel ten miles?' The base number is four, the next number is ten, the operation is multiplication and the result is forty. As shown in figure `4' below. Let us now apply this procedure to our current problem. Polly throws one hundred fifty feet and this is increased in range by seven times in order to equal a distance of one thousand two hundred fifty feet outside the range of Perg's breath. We know that Polly throws the javelin one hundred twenty five feet when holding the sapphire, so our next step is to add this on to our result of one thousand two hundred fifty feet. The entire equation is as follows, `$1,125+125=1,250$'. Therefore Polly could stand one thousand two hundred fifty feet away from the dragon and the javelin would reach him!

It can now be understood why we were taught to learn our multiplication table when young since it was a fundamental part of all math work. Without these simple facts the mathematics of real life would simply escape you; however since you already know this to be true, let us move forward. When Polly lets go of the sapphires, she can throw the javelin fifty percent further than when she had them. Since fifty percent of one is always half let us determine this: \\[`\\frac{400}{2}=200\\] \\Rightarrow Polly can throw the javelin twenty ounces. Therefore we see that Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 1200 feet when she has the sapphires. She throws the javelin one thousand ninety six feet if without the stones.

To get the full equation for the distance from perg we use the same process as above; we solve for TotalDamage. 1200 = TotalDamage - 400. Then, because we know that TotalDamage = DamageLimit we have another substitution to make: 1200 = DamageLimit - 400, or 1600 = DamageLimit. Back to solving for our distance, using your original equation: 400 = DistanceFromDragon - 1600 - DistanceFromDragon.

You now know how far away Polly must stand and still be safe from the dragon's fire, while being within range of its destructive powers: MinimumDistance is 200 ft., and since your unit is feet, you would round to 200 ft., which is just over a sixth of a mile.",

TotalDamage = 1200 -> DamageFromNoJewel = 1000 and DamageFromJewel = 200. Here the value DamageFromNoJewel is not important, but we still use it to set up the multiplication and addition needed to get to the final answer. You can move on to the final calculation. We already know DamageFromJewel = 200, so simply add 200 to DamageFromNoJewel to find Damage, the overall distance required to hit the dragon. As mentioned before, DamageFromJewel = 200, so DamageFromNoJewel + DamageFromJewel = Damage. 200 + 1000 = 1200, the same as TotalDamage. Our final answer is then 1200.",

We assumed that the dragon was 400 feet away from her, but if she throws this weak javelin that won\u2019t reach the dragon, then the dragon is obviously further than 400 feet away, since it didn't get hit. The question implies (if there weren't already other clues) that Polly isn't able to use any sort of magic, so it doesn't make sense that she wouldn't miss the dragon. This tells us that there needs to be some extra distance added onto the TotalDistance, but because of the bonus from the gemstone and because Polly might just as easily hit him as be thrown off by his flames, the value should just stay the same. Since we know that Polly is not using any abilities to help her reach the dragon, we can assume that the maximum damage radius can be taken directly out of the equation and we should simply plug the new value into the distance part: -TotalDistanceLimit + TotalDamage = DistanceFromDragon.

Knowing these two things, we must create a second part in our equation: DamageBonus + (Damage + Bonus) >= (TotalDamage - DragonHealth). When simplified: 1200 >= (TotalDamage - 1000). So now you have: 1200 >= 1200 - TotalDamage. By doing the above steps, you were able to remove DragonHealth from your equation, which is nice. Just adding up all the equations, we see: 400 = TotalDamage + 1200 >= 1200 - TotalDamage. Solving the inequality (>=), we find that: 1200/2 >= TotalDamage, meaning that: 600 >= TotalDamage, meaning that: 600 > TotalDamage. From this, we get that TotalDamage equals: 583 feet.

        " damage we could do, but we don\u2019t actually have a value for the damage limit yet. Instead of trying to solve directly for the TotalDistance, let\u2019s create another variable for the amount of bonus power the gem grants (BonusPower). Our new equation becomes BonusPower*DistanceToDragon+3*400=TotalDamage, since she gets a 400 foot boost from the sapphire. By subtracting these values we get [(BonusPower + 4)*400] = TotalDistance - [1000 - (BonusPower + 4)*400]. Substituting TotalDamage, [(BonusPower + 4)*400]=1200-(1000- (BonusPower+4)*400). Finally solving the equation (and removing grouping), we get (BonusPower+4)*400 = 200 - (BonusPower + 4) * 400. Solving for BonusPower, BonusPower=482/388. This may seem like a strange way to find our BonusPower, but the key thing to remember is that we want to keep things isolated when possible. Since we have a solution for the BonusPower and the distance to the dragon is dependent on the value of BonusPower, we can easily calculate the total distance. The equation then becomes (BonusPower + 4)*400= TotalDistance, with BonusPower equaling 482/388 as established above. From there it becomes ([482/388]+4)*400= TotalDistance. Therefore, the TotalDistance is [(482/388)+4]*400 or roughly 3982.6 feet. Note that if Perg hadn\u2019t moved away after the second attempt, Polly would have just hit him twice more and killed him, even without using the gem.

Remembering that we want the greatest distance possible for Polly to succeed, it is best to add values to 1200, and find out what the furthest distance away Perg would have to be while staying within 1000 feet of Polly. To make Perg as far from Polly as possible, adding another 500 makes him 1500 feet away while Polly is still standing inside the radius of danger. Therefore 1500 should replace 1200 in our original equation. 1500 = Distance is your final equation.

        " you solve this problem, but first let me share some advice about mathematics itself. Mathematics is a powerful tool for understanding our world, but it is also a language, and like any language, it can be used for good or ill. As a writer and speaker myself, I know that choosing the right words can make all the difference in communicating our message effectively. When solving a mathematical problem, we must carefully select the tools at our disposal. This may seem daunting, but with practice and patience, we can develop the skills necessary to approach even the most complex mathematical problems with confidence. One strategy is to break down the problem into smaller parts, each of which we know how to solve. With this method, we can tackle even the most challenging equations without becoming overwhelmed. Another technique is to simplify the equation as much as possible before trying to find a solution. This means getting rid of unnecessary elements that clutter up the problem. Once we simplify it, we may see patterns or relationships that point us toward the answer. It's important to remember that there is no single correct way to solve a problem. Different approaches work better for different people, so don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Some people prefer to start with simpler problems and build their confidence as they go. Others prefer to dive right in and tackle the hardest puzzles first. Still others like to approach problems from multiple angles, testing different methods until they find one that works. No matter what strategy you choose, the most important thing is to keep trying until you get it right. Don't give up! Each mistake brings you closer to the truth, and every success builds on what came before it. Mathematics may feel overwhelming sometimes, but with persistence and creativity, you can conquer any equation and unlock the hidden patterns of the universe.",
