We get: 8/(75/3). To find out how many flowers each of the three bushes has (the numbers are in the denominators), it'll take a bit more math because it isn't exactly evenly divisible into them. 75% of one goes into the first bushes, and there are only a few remaining left over for the other two. Let us do this calculation for the second bush next. This time there is a single leftover thorn from the first bush, so it gets divided up equally among both plants (because you cannot divide up partial fractions). For instance, let us say that there are seven flowers and each flower has ten thorns; this means that there would be sixty-eight of them altogether. In order to distribute these between the two different plants, what you can do is divide seventy six hundred eighths among six plants--this gives three hundred ninety-two thirds per one plant (you can verify this using multiplication if necessary); thus now each rose only needs four thorns to fully cover it. The last thing that remains before getting an answer would be doing similar maths regarding all twelve roses together--they split up into fourths according their amount as well (since there were twelve in total). Finally, we must add up the numbers from each step in order to receive our answer! Thus the result turns out being twenty one thousandths per a single stem when taking both sides of its body into account (within certain ranges).",

In fact, since there are 3 rosebushes in all, we actually just need to multiply the number of thorns for each rosebush by 3. Therefore, since each rosebush contains $\\frac{8}{1}=8$ roses, there are $8\\times 3=24$ thorns per rosebush.

Also, since there is only 1 rose per bush, all of those roses in one rose bush together amount to one single rose. We need to take this into consideration too. When we multiply, this means that each factor that appears multiple times will contribute multiples to the product. Thus for this example, 3 * 1 = 3, indicating the total number of rose bushes. We can generalize this rule about contributions to products as 3 * 1 * 25 * 8 = 2,250. 2,250 is the total number of thorns present. The answer is: 2,250.",
        " so we multiply that by 8/25. To get 8/25 in math, we could write it as an improper fraction (15/25), or as a mixed number (3/5). But when we work with integers, it may make sense to just go straight to simplifying instead. 1 * 8 / (25) = (8 / 25) + (8 / 25) = (8 / 25) + (8 / 25) = 2 * (8 / 25) = 2/5. If you want to find out what 2/5 simplifies down to, just factor its prime factors like you would when finding LCDs! (But be careful when factoring! Just because 25 can be written as (5^2), that doesn't mean you should automatically multiply by itself twice without checking if anything else divides into one or both numbers equally!)
