        " problem, let's look closely at the information in the question. First, we know that Grace weighs 125 pounds. Next, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. To calculate the total weight of Grace and Alex, we need to know both of their weights individually. Let's start by calculating how much Alex weighs: Alex weighs 2 fewer pounds than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since we already know that Grace weighs 125 pounds, let's substitute that into our equation: 4 times what Grace weighs = 4 * Grace's Weight (let's call that GW) Now, 4*GW - 2, which equals Alex's Weight. Substituting, we get: Alex's Weight = 4*GW - 2. We still need to find out what GW is so that we can determine Alex's weight. So next, I will go ahead and multiply the equation above by 5: 5(4*GW - 2). This allows us to cancel out the 4 to get rid of it. Simplifying, we get: 20GW - 10 = 5(4*GW - 2). To isolate the variable 'GW', we first add 10 to both sides of the equation, so that we get: 20GW - 10 + 10 = 5(4*GW - 2) + 10. Distributing and simplifying gives us the equation below: 20GW - 2 = 20GW. Solving the new equation: Subtracting the equation yields 20GW - 2 - 20GW = 0, since the subtraction of like terms works as an addition. This leaves us with GW = 0. Plugging 0 back into one of the previous equations gives us Alex's Weight = 4*0 - 2. Simplifying: Alex's Weight = -2. Therefore, the combined weights of Grace and Alex, in pounds, are 125 pounds for Grace, plus -2 pounds for Alex, which is equal to -2. However, the correct answer is not a negative answer. Rather, it is a positive number, representing the sum of the",
