Let's say this is some constant R. Because there are twice as many of something else compared to blue ties, it would also mean twice as many R things compared to one thing as well. Therefore the ratio between blue and R thing is also R : R. Since blue ties cost half as much as red ties and every blue tie costs $40, the cost of every R thing would be $20. That means 5 times the $20 which is $100. All together he paid (5 x 20 + 40) or $140. The answer is: $140.",

Substitute in what we already figured out about 2/3B times R being N plus some other amount:  R+2B-2(2/3R)=200/(B) - (2/3R)+ 2/3(2/3R). Simplifying, 5B-4R=200/(B)-2/3R.

Thus, 20*1 set =20 times 80, or simply 4000/2=2000. Finally, John has spent $2000.",
        " being the same value. So you can divide the answer found above across the pairs, and get to the following value. (Total Spending - Blue Ties) / Red Ties  i.e. $800/(10*(($40+$60)))= 40+30 = $70 . Hence 40 dollars spent buying 5 blue ones, plus 60 more spent on purchasing the ten others. Total spent= $100 + $600 = $700. We have arrived at the sum of the red prices which totals at 700. Thus the question is fully answered. The answer is 700.",

        " bought. Let n equal that amount. So: n*(1/2)*n=n -->n^2=n --(This is the same expression but in terms of n only) --> divide both sides by n--> n=1 So he bought one red tie and one blue tie. That means he spent 7+40 = 47 dollars on those two ties. The answer is: $47",
        ". Since he bought twice as many red ties, we know that there were 10 such ties. Now multiply the sum spent on red ties (($5)*10) by the multiplication factor (5/2), since they cost fifty percent more per unit. We need to subtract this value from the total amount spent by him: $5*(2)*(5)=$$100;--->$$200-$100= $$100; This sum is what was needed as the answer to the question about how much money John spent on the ties all together. Thus, the final answer would be $100 dollars.",
        " possible numbers of Red Ties based upon these details: Red tie price ($) = 5 blue tie price ($) = 40 Blue ties purchased = 5 Red ties Purchased = 10 Red tie price ($) = 3 blue tie price ($) = 40 Blue ties purchased = 5 Red ties Purchased = 10 So...",
