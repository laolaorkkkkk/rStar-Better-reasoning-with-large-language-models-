Then we multiplie this number times the amount of weeks in a month, or 4, to get the number of eggs eaten in a month. Finally, since a dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, we divide the monthly total by 12 to get the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in a month. That number, multiplied by the months in a year, will give us the total number of dozens of eggs she eats over the course of 4 weeks. Let's try to solve for these numbers and see what happens...

Since one egg is worth a fraction of a dozen, we add this fraction to make sure all the eggs get counted. Then we add them back into the total, which becomes (7*12 + 4)/12 = 11+4/12 eggs in total. Since there is only one way we can round up from 11.416... to the next unit number, it means that Claire would finish the 84 eggs with just the last half egg, leaving nothing at all, since we can't count half eggs.

Finally, to solve your actual problem, it would be easiest to calculate how many dozen eggs Claire uses per month first, since a dozen is equal to twelve, then simply multiply the result by four (for a week).

So to solve for eggs used over two weeks she needs to multiple by two because that's 2xweeks. (You can continue the process by multiplying by 4 if you wanted to find out all eggs used for the duration). In total she used a total of TWENTY ONE eggs per WEEK. That is your first variable determined. Second is how long her breakfast consumption is, so far we've seen that it is one week of a month. It is still not complete yet because this only shows the usage for the full month. Multiply the eggs again, as you would multiply anything else (such as numbers to make change) to account for the other weeks, such as the second and third weeks. We must remember that she eats eggs throughout the entire month so multiplying the eggs used by one week by three weeks (or 3x3 to get the result of 9) makes sense as that gives us how many eggs she eats in a total of three weeks. Remember that there are four weeks. You need to add another multiplication. Let's assume that this would apply to all other multiples of four weeks (that is, any odd number that is divisible by 4 will have the same effect as described here).

You need to keep asking yourself how many days are in each month (for example you might wonder why December 31st falls before March 1st when we know from our previous examples that March 31st is a Sunday).

        " three-egg omelette every day, it is equivalent to having one dozen eggs per day. How many days does this equation cover? Each week has seven days or equivalently seventy-two hours (one year). Multiplying the number of weeks by the number of years in each year will show how long the weekly time span is for your calculation. For example , there are three-weeks and forty-eight hours ( one year ) in the calculation so you can figure out how long you have used your recipe. Do you want to do any more than one week ? No. Since there are only 365 days in every year , divide by seven to get the number of weeks that your recipe covers 365 divided by 7 equals fifty-five so if you wish to calculate how many weeks your recipe covers in any given year , divide seventy-two by five which equals six. This will be the amount of time covered by your original recipe. Determine how many eggs you need daily based upon this period of time and then use your math skills to find out how many dozen are needed to complete the daily requirement. How many times over does this cover? Since 84 is the number of eggs Claire eats each day , multiplying by this number yields the number of dozen.

        " many eggs she eats every week. We know that she eats three eggs every day and she eats this amount for three weeks per month (there are four weeks per month, and Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every day). So if you take the number of months times the number of weeks per month, and then multiply it by three you get the number of weeks (three weeks per month and four months totalled) multiplied by three (which is the number of eggs consumed per day). Thus 3 x (3 months * 4 weeks/month) = 60 x 3 = 180. Now we need to consider how many eggs she consumes a dozen. Well it depends on whether you count half eggs as one or not. So let's assume half eggs do not count towards consumption but rather each full egg counts as two units (because both halves can be made into scrambled eggs or fried eggs etc.) so one whole egg = 2 units , one eggshell with no egg = zero units and half a shell (i.e one eggshell without any egg) still counts as 0.5 units . Also we don't have a unit for whites only because that would create an unwieldy answer so for simplicity let's assume whole eggs include all parts: white, yellow or brown yolk etc.... So what we really have here is whole eggs divided by our arbitrary units per week which is just dividing the whole number of whole eggs by the units for any given time period . In this case it would be dividing by 180 units over 4 weeks . Since we have half eggs , and since we are rounding up , the correct true answer would be something like 360 which rounds up to 372 eggs as shown below: **Numerator** (whole eggs): [180] Divisor :  [180] => Ratio : [1 : 1] Units (one whole egg): 372 Whole eggs (rounded up) = 372 half eggs : 0.5 Half eggs per whole egg --> Total units = 0.5 x 372 x 2 = 372 units / 360 => Rounds Up To => 1.0 units",

One dozen cookies contains twelve cookies, so there will be 84 / 12 = 7 whole dozen of eggs plus 4 remaining cookies, so seven complete dozen cookies. That\u2019s not the whole story! There are still four remaining cookies which cannot form a complete dozen, meaning that we still have some fraction of a dozen left. To figure out what part of a dozen we are missing, we simply divide the excess eggs (which here is equal to four) by twelve. Four / twelve = 1/3 of a dozen, and since one is an integer, we round down when dividing, meaning that this fractional value actually represents zero full dozens and therefore is only one third of a dozen egg cookies. Thus, the complete answer is one whole dozen with two thirds of a dozen. This translates into seven whole egg containers and then a little bit more than one third of a second container. That rounds up to two thirds of a whole container, resulting in an answer of eight eggs for the full month.",
