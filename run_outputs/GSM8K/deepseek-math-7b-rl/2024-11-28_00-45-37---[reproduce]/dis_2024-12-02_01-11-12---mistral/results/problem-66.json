The first additional person is the referee who watches over the game to make sure everyone plays fairly. The second additional category is \"spectators\". These would include anyone who comes to watch the games, whether fans, press, or simply people who came to socialize at a local event. In terms of numbers, these are just 1 referee plus some undetermined number of spectators, so a safe guess might be that there is around 1 more \"other person\" for every game. We can determine exactly how many other people are at the event if we know how many games there are. There are actually 8 games for our specific scenario because there is one men's game and one women's game against two different opponents. Each game requires 1 referee, so 8 such jobs, and a safe estimate of 5 more spectators for each game, or 40 overall. The other people are the 5 athletes in the women's games, who don't have their own coaches to accompany them, plus the 15 non-athletes accompanying the other athletes, and finally the referees watching over the game. This would add up to 4+5+5+1 = 15 total other people. Finally, the total number of people at the tournament is equal to the 40 athletes, 4 other people, and 15 other people (or 2 people per game). In summary, there is a total of 44 athletes attending plus 4 officials and then 15 other attendees, and finally the 8 spectators. The total amount of people present is thus 106 people.",

        " total of 40. Also note that there are no coaches involved in any of this, as stated in the original problem formulation. The coaches were not present at the basketball competition and therefore their numbers do not count towards our solution. However, if for whatever reason we would like to include them, then let us consider the following calculation. Since there was one person for every team, there were also four coaches. Together with the ten athletes per school, the resulting total number would add up to 14 participants per school and therefore in total 4 x 14 = 56 individuals instead of 40. Either way, depending on whether you choose to exclude or include the coaches, the result should still remain accurate and valid.",
        " as exact total of all participants: (4) x (10) = (40).",
        " would be 5 + 5 = 10. So 10 x 4 would be 40 players. Additionally, each school would send one coach; therefore, there are 4 x 1 coaches. Thus, 40 plus 4 equals 44 people. The answer is: 44.",
        " athletes in the competition is 4 x 10 = 40. But wait: we said that there were coaches as well! Each coach is not counted here, because the question was asking about people, and coaches aren't people - they are adults. However, when you think about it - each athlete counts as ONE person (we count athletes individually, regardless of age), but each coach counts as SEVERAL people! So, instead of just adding 40 athletes, we multiply that by the average number of players per coach: for example if the coach brings three other people then 40 would turn into 120; if the coach brings only one other person then 40 turns into 80. All these numbers could differ, so we can just use whatever average number of people in general comes along to do this computation. If you don't know anything else, we can use 3 as an average value; however note that this particular estimate may not always be correct since the average varies across countries according to the norms within them. Once you figure out your number, divide it back by this multiplier you used initially - i.e., our division should reflect what is happening behind the scenes - 3 * 40 = 120, which divided by 3 equals 40 again! This tells us that there are 40 extra people who aren't included in our final sum; hence our final answer should reflect that fact too...but it doesn't! You might find yourself tempted to say 50 since you added up all those coaches...but hold on - we already subtracted off those 40 extras back above so we wouldn't want any repetition in those extra numbers either! So what's our final answer then?? Why not 40 + 40? Or even better yet: (40 + 40) / 2 + 1 = 41 = 42...which would indeed match up with your original assumption given earlier about there being 5 players per team!",
