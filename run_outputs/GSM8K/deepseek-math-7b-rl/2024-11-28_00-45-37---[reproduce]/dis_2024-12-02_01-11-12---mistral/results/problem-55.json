That remainder is 0.5.  We can find out the quotient when we divide by another factor (the next integer). 28 / 3 = 9. The quotient 9 says there can be up to 9 bags of 2 lollipops. Since 28 is not a multiple of 2, it is possible to fit more than 2 lollipops into one bag.  So to find out how many lollipops are left after we pack the bags, we can multiply the quotient 9 by 2 so we have 18 lollipops. We will have 18 lollipops and we know that we just packed 9 bags, meaning we still have 9 lollipops left. Therefore we can form a new bag that contains three 2 lollipop bags plus an extra lollipop.
