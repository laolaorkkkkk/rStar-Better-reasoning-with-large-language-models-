The problem asks us how to calculate the yearly rate for our $600.00 savings account if there was 3 years (3 times), during which no withdrawals or deposits occurred. The question wants us to find out what type of rate of return (annual rate) one needs in order to double their income over 5 years (period = 5). That is, it wants to solve for n in n + 600 = 2 * 300, or n / 300 = 600/300 = 2.

We start off with $7200 x (1+ 0. 10), which equals 7761; adding 5% into things makes this go down closer toward our goal amount (about $800) until finally reaching $8207--close but not exact thanks partly due lack precision when rounding certain figures beforehand . So that's how to find Sylvie's new paycheck each year based on past performance! Let's try using formulas instead now :)",
        ". Since we want our final yearly salary figure at the end of this third decade after working through all ten years (the entire fifteen year life span), it stands to reason that any additional increase beyond this base level needs calculated according to those same rules as when calculating percentages using decimals instead - simply multiplying by eleven again for the final pay out... (10%\u00d710yrs =$7200*10%=$.720) Then dividing by another thousand dollar unit because we want per year totals only not including months ($72\u00d71=60$). Which rounds nicely down making things easy enough even though technically one million six hundred thousand would seem rather odd !",

        " 10 %* 600= 60 The increase in salary is 60 dollars every year for the 5 yrs she's been working for them. $60 dollar increase per year for 5 years is 5*60=$300. Add the basic amount and the increase amount, we get 780+300=1080. Calculate the salary amount for the last year before she quits. Let's say this year (year 6) she works as usual, and so the base pay is the same. And next year is her quit year, so her final yearly salary will be 1080+ 10% of 1080, equals 1188. Her monthly salary would be 1188/12, which is 99. Therefore, her average yearly salary for these three years will be 1188 + 1000 + 990 divided by 3, which is 1118 /3. Rounding up to the nearest integer, she earned 372.7 for the 3 years. Her salary in any year can be calculated by multiplying it with her current base pay, and then adding 372.7. For example, let us take 2014, where Sylvia was paid $600 in June 2014. So her first year's salary would be 600+372.7=972.7, rounded up, would be 973.",

Add her base salary amount to receive the annual salary over three more years; $600+$780=$1380. Finally, we need to determine the monthly salary amount. Divide $1380 by $12 to obtain the monthly salary of $115 ($1380/$12)==$115. To conclude that over three years, Sylvie gets $1380. But that isn't yet done since the salary increase comes into play after five years. Hence to calculate the new salary, add the first salary increase of $780 to obtain $1380, which then increases by another 10%, meaning 0.1 * $1380 = $138. Then to obtain the monthly salary, divide by $12. So over three years the salary has increased as follows: 600 + (60x3)+(60x3)x0.1x12==$138.",
