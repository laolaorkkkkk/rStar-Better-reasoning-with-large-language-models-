        " Eliza works for 45 hours so we add up her overtime earnings from hours 41 to 45. Overtime means 1.2 time her current hourly rate. For example the calculation for hour 41 would look like this: $10\u00d7(41/40)\u00d71.2 = $11.30. So adding this up for all the hours she worked this week we have an answer: $$At=400+((45-40)/40)\\times 10\\times 1.2=557.60 $$So her earning this week was $557.60. The answer is: 557.60.",

        " determine how much extra she was paid ,we must determine how much money her hourly rate is worth. Since 40*$10=400 and her hourly rate is worth $10 , her hourly wage rate is equal to $10 / hr. Then we need to multiply 5 (the number of time and a half hours earned) * $10 (her hourly rate). This would give us $50 . We add $400 (base pay) and $50 ( extra pay) together to get total pay of $450. So the answer is: $450.",
        " Let me go ahead and do the calculation. 45 hours total, the first 40 hours at $10 and the last 5 at 1.2*10 = $12. So her normal work hours give us 40 x 10 = $400 and the overtime hours give us 5 x 12 = $60, so all together she gets $400+$60=$460, which is the answer we're looking for.",
