        " know she kept 5/3rd and sold 2 more than the number of vacuum cleaners left (which equals 2). Since she only sold 1/3rd at the green house and half of what was left at the orange house, the remaining third was sold at the red house. We also know that x/3rd went to the green house. So this means it's equal to 2/3rds of all the remaining third. That's why if you do 1/3rd x 2/3rd = 2/9. But this only applies for vacuum cleaners left which is 2/3rd or 2 out of 5 (that's why multiply it by 20 since 20 x 2/9 == 4) so you get 4. Then add it all up together which means x/3 + x/3 + 1/3 + x/2 + 4 equals whatever initial amount of vacuum cleaners you started off with. Which makes sense because 8/9 + 8/9 + 1/3 + 8/9 + 4 = 45, but 23 x 3 - 23 x 2/3 + 23 - 23/2 + 23 x 4 = 45. But if you take all these numbers and divide them by 45, it would be equivalent to x/45+x/45 + x/135 - 4/9 + 1 = x/45(2) and that simplifies down into x=240 since 9*240 is 2160 and 45/9 times 240 equals 2160. That proves our original statement that if there were 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have begun with 240. The answer is: 240.",

Next we are told she sells 'two more' than she sold to the green house to the red house. Again working in equation form and remembering that she only had zero after selling 'a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house' we see that if we call the number of items at the red house, N_2 we have the following relationship between our quantities: (N/3) + 2 = N_2 . This yields N / 3 + 2 = N_2 and isolating the original number N and solving for it gives us the following equation: N = 6(N_2) / 3 - 2. This can be rewritten as N = 4 * N_2 / 3 - 2, and using simple fractions we get N = (4/3)*(N_2) - 6/3. Now we simply substitute in the final information we have, N_2 = 5. Plugging this in we obtain N = (4/3)*5 - 6/3 = 14/3 - 6/3 = 14/3 - 2/1 = 12/3 or 4. Therefore Melanie started with four vacation cleaners. The answer is: 4.",

Say z is what is left over after going to the orange house. If z is less than half of y + 2, then she takes all of it, meaning z.

Let\u2019s rewrite the equation in the way so it can be solved with just a single variable. First lets divide the first equation with 3 to give us (2)+(1)+(3*2/3)+x=Total Number Remaining. When looking back at our second equation we see that it is telling us that what you got remaining is 5. So we want to set both sides of the second equation as equal to the Total Number Remaining which is 5 and 7x=5, making x=5/7. When we look at our first equation (2)+(1)+(2)+x=5/7 then we add up both sides to give us 2+(3x/7)=Total Number Vacuum Cleaners Sold. Using our original value of X, 5/7, we have x=5/7=32/49=(2x/3)(32x+29). Thus 2=(22x+29)/(7x+7). Cross multiply by 7x-29=2. Solving for x gives 29/7=x so x=4. Plugging x into the 1st equation we get (2+1+(3*2x))/3, then doing our substitution (4+2)/3=5/3=1+2/3=1+2/3=1+(4/3), then finally plugging in (4/3) and simplifying we have (4/3)+2=6/3=2.

This means G + 2 = R, or G = R - 2.\rFinally, she sold half (1/2) of the remaining cleaners at the orange house (O). This means 1/2 * (X - G) = O. Thus X - G = 2O, so X - (R - 2) = 2O, meaning X - R + 2 = 2O => X = R + 2 + 2O or X = 3(R + O). The remaining amount (the difference of X and G, R, and O), L, is X - G - R - O. Therefore, X - G - R - O = X - (R - 2) - R - O = (2 - 2)(R - 2) - O, which reduces to -R + 2O - O = X - R + 2O = 5, the amount that Melissa has left. Plugging -R + 2O = X - R + 2O into the equation above yields -R + 2O = 5, and subtracting 5 from both sides results in 5 + R = 5(O + 1), so 5(O + 1) = 5O + 5 = 3(X + R + 2O), which divides to X + R + 2O = 3. Plugging 3 back into 5 + R = 5(O + 1) gives O + 1 = R + 2O, 2O + O = R + 3, 3O = R + 3, and dividing both sides by 3 results in O = (R + 3)/3. Adding up O, R, and G on both sides of the first equation gives X = 2G + 3O + 5, or X = 5R + 3(R + 3)/3 + 5, which reduces to 2X = 12R + 9 and further simplifies to X = 3(R + 3)/",

Half of what was left was sold at the orange house. That will be \u00bd \u00d7 (\u2153 + 2) = .33 \u00d7 M + 2. At this point we have accounted for (\u2153 + 2) / 3 = .33 \u00d7 M + 2.

This means solving for the variable 'X'. Let's say X represents the number of cleaners initially, and M represents the number of cleaners Melanie sold (3rd of them, 2 more to the red house, \u00bd left). Since \u2154 X \u2212 2 = M, we know that X\u2212M=2(since M+2=\u2154X). And since M+5=\u00bdX, we get X\u2212(M+2)=5, thus: X=M+2+(5/2)=M+2+2.5=M+4.5. Solving for M gives us X\u22125=2.5, which simplifies to X=7.5. Hence the original value of X, or \u2155 of the cleaners she started out with, is 7.5. Therefore, Melanie\u2019s initial stock of cleaners was 7.5 times that 5 = 18. That makes sense because she sold \u2153 of her inventory and then \u00bc of what remained, and these values add to 5.",

Similarly, (k)/(3)/(2) represents half of the remaining amount. This value is used to indicate the amount of cleanits sold during the second sale. In order to solve the equation, we apply basic arithmetic to both sides. The value of (k)/(3) \u20132 equals 5 because the equation\u2019s initial value is known. By adding 5 to both sides of the equation we obtain: (k)/(3) = 15 We multiplied by three because it cancels the denominator on both sides of the equation. By subtracting 2 from both sides we get: (k) = 42 Lastly, we divide by 4 because the variable was multiplied by 3 earlier in the calculation process, therefore canceling each other out. We come to the conclusion that k =108 .
