        " pair of heels costs 33 dollars, so the other pair of shoes must cost 66 dollars. The equation for the first shoe looks like this: x + x = 99. Where does x come from? We know that (x)(2) = 66, because if you multiply any two numbers together, their product will be equal to whatever you plug in for each one. Next we find two numbers whose product equals 99 and add those two numbers together. These numbers are 9 and 11 or 3 and 33. Now let's put our equations into words. x + y = 99 and 9 + 11 = 20. This means that if we add 9 and 11 together, we get 20, which is the same result we got from multiplying x and y. This is what it looks like when we plug our answers into both sides of the equation: (9)(9)=(11)(10); 81+10=90+9; 90+90=81+10+100; 180/9 = (100+11)/10; (10)+((11*10)/9) ; (10/1) = ((11*10)/9). Finally, we use division to divide 9 into each side, giving us the answer 11x100 = (9x99)/9.",
        " its 2x33 or 66 . Since Gloria can afford both pairs, the total amount spent on shoes equals the price of the boots and the two pairs of high heels. So, B+33+66=99. Solving for B, we get B=99 - (33+66) = 99 - 100 = -1. This means that the answer cannot be negative so we conclude that there were no boots left. Therefore the price of the boots was 0.",
        " price and forty four. The answer is: 44.",
        "\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first find out how much each pair of shoes costs. If the more expensive pair of heels cost twice as much as the less expensive pair, then that means they cost three times as much as the less expensive pair altogether. 3 * 33 = 99. The original price was 84 + 99 = 183 dollars. The answer is: 84.",
        " original price is more than B, which makes it greater than or equal to B, so we can write B \u2265 84. Also, we can write the following equation: 55 = (B \u2013 33) + 2(B \u2013 33). Simplifying yields 88 = 3B \u2013 66, or 3B = 154. Therefore, the answer to the question is B = 154/3. So the price of the boots is $51.33.",
        " $33+2\\times33=52$ dollars less than the price of the boots. Using these facts, we can set up an equation to find the price of the boots: Since the equation is quadratic, we need to factor it to solve it. Dividing both sides of the equation by $10$ gives: Solving this quadratic equation gives us $B=22$ dollars. Thus, the price of the boots is $22$ dollars. The answer is: 22.",
        " final price of boots . the answer is : eighty four .",
        " find out what the price of the boots is, we need to add up the price of the other 2 shoes. Since one is 33, the other is 66. We know that it is 5 dollars cheaper so now we add all 3 prices togheter to get the answer of 99. The difference b/w the last price and the 3rd is 24. Subtract that fro the final price and you get the final answer. It is 25 Dollars as boots",
        " know that three times B minus 5 is equal to sixty six dollars. This means that B is equal to sixty six divided by three plus five. This simplifies to twenty three plus five, which equals twenty eight. Therefore, the answer to the original question is twenty eight dollars.",
        " high heels is less than the cost of the boots, so let H represent the lower price and L represent the higher. Since L is exactly twice as much as H, we know the equation L = 2H. When solving such equations like the above in one variable, it helps to write them in terms of the smaller value. This can be done since it holds true that 2H = L. Therefore, substituting the equation into the original inequality, we get 2H = 33 and H = 16.5. So we get that $16.50 is the answer. We hope this explanation cleared things up! Thank you for using the AI assistant, and enjoy your shoe shopping!",
        " card that both pairs of shoes cost five dollars less than the boot set. Therefore, we can write an equation like so ---> x+(first set)=x+5 ---> (x+first set)\u2013x=5-----> first set=5;--we now replace \u2018first set\u2019 in the second equation with 5 and solve for x----> Boot+first set=2(x+33)--(Boot+first set)-second equation --(x+5)=2(x+33)-33--------> -->(x+5)-x=2(x+33)-33-x; which simplifies over into 5=2x+30-x-x--->5=x+30----->5-30=x or x=(-25).---therefore the answer is $(-25).",
        " $94 or the Boots come out $94$. Hopefully this makes sense and helps for more complex problems involving equations!",
        " with the conditions stated; as nothing wrong occurred throughout while working out solutions here today .",
        " just 99 dollars or greater even ! Which is why it makes total sense to say that Gloria paid $94 bucks (or better yet maybe something higher) to get her stylish footwear which were definitely not cheap !. Thank you so much ! Hope this math exercise provided fun while learning at same time too !Have a nice night !"
