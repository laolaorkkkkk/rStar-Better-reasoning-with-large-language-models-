        " The maximum number of boxes is the amount we add to the weight of the driver and the empty truck to equal 5000 pounds. Let's first see what that subtraction gives us. 5000 - 3755 = 1245. This is the maximum number of boxes to load if there was no driver or empty truck. However, we also need to subtract the weight of the driver plus the empty truck to account for them. Since 3755 - 15 = 3740 and this number is less than 1245, we know there is space for one box only. Therefore the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 1. The answer is: 1.",

Therefore, we instead try to find the smallest number that is divisible by 15 that also meets the criteria. So if we start counting backwards from 9960 pounds, it goes like this (15 * 664) - 14 = 9970.
