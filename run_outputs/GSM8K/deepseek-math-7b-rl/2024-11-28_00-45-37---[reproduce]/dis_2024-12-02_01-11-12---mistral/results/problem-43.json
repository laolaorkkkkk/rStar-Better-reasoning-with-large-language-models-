Each gram of chip is 50 calories (as determined above). Then, we need to multiply 50 * 200 = 10000, which means you can eat only 200 grams of chips before surpassing the 2000 calorie limit.

The answer is: 4 g.",

At this point then just take away from that whatever amount of calories are included in your four servings equaling out to 400 calories all together (from the original 250 calories for each individual serving multiplied by however many servings) in order for us to get precisely what we're looking for here: your current leftover allowance minus 400 grams worth of snacks gives us our desired outcome number being precisely zero because when taking into account both sets of calculations everything should add back up exactly with regards to caloric value left within reason without going over one's total limit thus yielding no further consumption beyond said threshold point! Allowing users freedom yet guidance while simultaneously keeping them safe and healthy within appropriate boundaries is an important factor here too as well obviously making sure individuals never accidentally stray past established boundaries such as consuming greater quantities than allowed ultimately leading towards dangerous health outcomes overall should remain paramount priority throughout entire process!!",

Now let us divide the remainder into the bag's servings (-550 / 5 = -110) and find out how many servings are left in our bag (-110 < 0). In order to prevent any negative values, let's replace them with their absolute values (i.e., -110 -> 110). As a result, it means that the bag can only contain 110 servings (-110+110=0) at this time. Therefore, we know that 110 servings can be taken out.

Finally use that new information and apply it to the original question. What do we need to know: one bag gives 250 calories.

This means you could consume an extra 800 g or just over half a pound of chips. However, since you mentioned you had already eaten something before the snack, it seems like you meant you had 2000 calories left over and not 2000 in total. In this case, you still have only 200 calories to spend, which corresponds to 800 grams as well.

        " According to the nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. So the number of calories in the whole bag is (number of servings) x (calories per serving), which is 5 servings x 250 calories per serving = 1250 calories. Then, we know that a 300g bag has 5 servings, so we need to figure out how many grams can be eaten if we are aiming for 2000 calories per day and have already consumed 1800 calories. To start, divide the number of calories left, which is 2000 - 1800 = 200, by the number of calories in one serving, which is 250. That tells us how many servings are allowed, which is 200/250 = 0.8 servings. We don't want part of a serving, so we will round up to 1. That means we can eat 1 serving from our bag of chips. But we can only eat it if the whole bag doesn't have too many calories. How many calories are in one gram of chips? Again, the nutritional info says it takes 250 calories to make 5 servings from the whole bag. Each gram weighs about 0.5g (it's actually very small when divided that way!). To find the calories per gram, we can divide by 0.5 since there are 2 servings in every 0.5g: 250 / (0.5) = 500. That means each gram of chips has 500 calories. Now we know how many calories are left to eat before we hit our 2000-calorie limit. We just need to use this information to determine the amount of weight we can eat. Since each gram of chips has 500 calories, we need to multiply by grams eaten by 500 to get the number of calories left. For example, if we wanted to eat a half gram of chips, we could eat .5g x 500 = 250 calories. That leaves us 2000 - 250 = 1750 calories to reach our goal, leaving 450 calories to use.

Since each serving is 96g, you have consumed (480g / 96g) or 5 servings. We can also use our original equation: Portion Size =Total Number Of Servings => 5 Thus ,you would be able to consume an additional 480gms We can find the total calories in this amount by multiplying the number of servings times the number of calories in a serving. (servings)(Calories/serving)=(5)(250)=1250. The answer is: 1250."
