        " were done at 5:00 PM, only 92% of your original candle was left (because $8/(100)\\approx92\\%$). If we want to know what the exact percent was, we can just multiply the percentage of the candle remaining by 100%. To show that our answer of 92% is correct, let\u2019s work backwards and use the \u201cpercentage method\u201d to solve this problem algebraically. Let\u2019s say we start out with a candle that was $C$ cm long; then after burning for $x$ hours, it is $(C \u2013 8)$ cm long. Therefore, we can express the fraction of the total length the candle lost by dividing the amount of candle melted ($8$) by the total length of the candle at first, $C$, which would mean $\\displaystyle{\\frac{(C\u20138)}{C}=0.92}$; rearranging terms yields $\\displaystyle{\\frac{8}{C}=0.08}$, and multiplying both sides by $C$ results in $\\displaystyle{8=0.08 C}$. We could check that this equation is right by plugging the numbers into the expression. That checks out! Because the 2 centimeters come off at a constant rate and the candle is burning for 4 hours, we will get twice the amount burned. Since there were 8 initially, that would mean 16 more (or 24 total) cm's of candle burning away for a total amount of 32 centimeters. When divided by 32, the 92 percent represents what percentage remained, or $36$. Multiply the decimal remainder ($0.36$) by 100. $0.36*100=36$. The answer is 36 percent. In conclusion, the candle started out with 100%, then the 8cm loss, or 8% over 4 hours, made the percentage drop 8%, so it was 92%. The 92% times $100$ makes $36\\%$, meaning the percentage difference would leave $36\\%$ of the candle remaining in length after 4 hours compared to its original state. Therefore, the candle will end up being 64 percent as tall as it was after four hours.",

To convert 2 centimeters per hour to centimeters, we need to multiply by 60 to get (1 centimeter per hour) * (60 minutes) = 60 centimeters. Similarly, one hour is equal to 60 minutes. Thus 4 hours would become 4 times longer so 4 * (60 centimeters) = 240 centimeters. That is how we convert both of them.

        " question. Let\u2019s use the information we were given. Let the initial length of the candle be \\(x\\) centimeters at 1 pm. By 2pm, the candle will melt by \\(x*1/4=x/4\\) because it melted one fourth (2 hrs divided by 8 hrs) of its original length in those hours.By 3pm it will melt further by \\(x*1/8=x/8\\) because the fraction of melted part becomes \u2153. By 4pm it will melt further by \\(x*1/16=x/16\\) because fraction of melted part is now \u00bd and so on. At 5pm, there will still be part of the candle remaining whose fraction is \u2159. This amount would be \\(x*1/8=x/8\\) cm long. Subtracting all these amounts from our original length \\(x\\), we find out that the final amount would be \\(x \u2013 x/4 \u2013 x/8 \u2013 x/16 \u2013 x/32 \u2013 x/64 \u2013 x/128\\) cm or \\[80.\\]. B. We conclude that the final amount would be 80 cm shorter. That\u2019s great! But wait, we also have to account for the time before 1pm that you mentioned earlier! What if this candle was already partly burnt at 1pm? In that case we would subtract only the fractions of parts that haven\u2019t melted yet up to then while keeping track of what time it was when these portions burned through. If the whole thing took 16 hrs to burn completely and it hadn\u2019t burned anything up till noon then only six hours would remain so that fraction of the full length of 16 hrs will still not have finished burning even though another 4 hours pass during which another quarter of the remaining portion will burn down i.e. one sixth . So instead of multiplying by one over twelve as previously we can say 11 over 6 (which represents the same thing as one sixth since 6 \u00d7 1\u204412 = 11\u20446). We now go back to our previous equation but replace \\(2pm, 3pm,\\: 4pm,\\: 5pm\\) with \\(10am,\\: 11am,\\: 12nn,\\: noon \\",
