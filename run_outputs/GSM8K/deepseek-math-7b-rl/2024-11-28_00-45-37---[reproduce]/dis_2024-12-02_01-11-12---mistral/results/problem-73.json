Therefore, if the annual APR is 2%, then the monthly APR would be: Monthly APR = 2% / 12 = 0.2%. With the interest rate, we can then determine the amount of additional cost to the final price by multiplying it by the principal (i.e., the sum of all purchases). Hence, the extra charge applied to the purchase is obtained by computing: Interest amount = (Monthly APR / 12 ) x Principal, which results in $750 x 0.2/12 = $750 x 0.01667 = $12.50. Finally, we just add together the total cost of the cell phones plus the extra charge resulting from the interest to obtain the grand total, which gives: Amount per billing cycle = Total cost + Interest = ($750 + $12.50) = $762.50.

Next, we want to calculate the total payment due for all 5 units over the course of three months by adding up the total amount of the original purchase price along with each cellphone's corresponding interests fees over time period of the installment loan agreement between Shiela and her supplier.
