We multiply it with the number of students left, so $16 * 0.25 = 4$ students enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves $(20 - 4) - 4 = 12$ students in hip-hop dance.

That leaves 12 students, all of whom took hip-hop dance. The percentage of students who took hip-hop dance is 12/(20+12)*100%, which equals 12/(32)*100%=37.5%. The answer is: 37.5.",

As such, 120% of the students who remained chose hip-hop dance. However, since hip-hop dance was the last category chosen, the 0% who enrolled in it will not be part of our solution, so let's say 120% minus 0%, meaning that 120% of the remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance. We can write this as a fraction too, so $0.120 / 0.100 = 1.2$ of all of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. This means that $1.2 * 20 / 1$ students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The answer is: 24."
