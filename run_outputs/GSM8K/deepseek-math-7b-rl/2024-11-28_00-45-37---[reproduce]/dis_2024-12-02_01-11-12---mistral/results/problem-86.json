        " other hand, you could use algebraic expressions to solve this question. The time it was ringing in the first go was x seconds and so the time it was ringing in the second go was 12x seconds. By dividing them we can say that 12x/(6x) = 6/1. Solving the fraction we get: x = 2. And therefore x + 12x + 6x = 18x = 36 which means the time it was ringing is 36 sec. This solution took me significantly longer though. Let's do it! First we need to find the length of the first time it rang. We know that 1 round equals 12 seconds and the second round is three times as long, so let's call the value of the first one x rounds. This means our formula would become: 1x + (3x)(12) = 12(3)+(3)x => 12(x+3) = 12x+36 which simplifies down to => 3x = 24 => x = 24/3 => x=8. Then we multiply that by our 12 seconds per round and we get: 8*12 = 96 seconds. For the last part if you wanted to find out how much time would be passed by in total here's what I did: Since time goes backwards we could solve 18-y instead (where y=time in seconds). That would make the whole thing equal y=18 and we plug that in to find y=24, so its equivalent 3 times (since each round was equal). Hence the entire sum equals 18-72=72sec = 1.2 mins",

We know this because the first time the alarm went off was double the second time, so the second time had six rings, and we already subtracted those earlier. Finally, the alarm only played twice as long the last time. Therefore, it rang for a half of the length of the second time, which was six rounds, making it three rounds long. By summing them together we see that there were 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 total. Thus the correct solution is 22.\\<solution>4\\(2^0\\)<\\<solution>.",

        " 6 times the amount of notes that the first round did. And since that was equal to 4 times, we need to calculate the amount of notes in the first round. Thus the amount of notes played was 4 times (or 2 * 2) the amount of notes in the last ringing session. As a result, in the final session, Greg's alarm rung for six minutes or 360 seconds. To find the total duration of the sounds made by the alarm today, we simply multiply the total by the number of occurrences. This gives us 6 + 12 + 36 = 54 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds per minute, Greg heard the alarm ring out for a total of 0:54 or fifty four seconds during the day.",

        " went off, it continued to ring for $4$ times. The second time, it continued to ring for three times longer than the first time, which is $\\boxed{(4 \\times 3)}$, which equals <<(4 * 3)=12>>12. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} * 12}$, which is equal to <<$\\frac{1}{2}$ * 12=6>>$6$. And you can also add these numbers all together, you'll get 4 plus 12 plus 6, which is equal to <<4+12+6=22>>22. We already know how long each individual note lasted. So now we just need to figure out how many there were in total. First off, the answer for this problem could only be an integer, so the fact that the second part came back at a longer duration isn\u2019t really relevant to the actual answer. So what are we trying to figure out? Let\u2019s break down everything that was given so we can rewrite the equation using those elements. The first thing we can determine is how long the first alarm lasts based on the initial information, it\u2019s just a fraction of one alarm. To write that out, we take the result of the first division and multiply it by two (<<$\\frac{1}{4}$x2=>$\\frac{1}{2}$>>). Since the second alarm lasted three times as long as the first, we use the multiplication method again except we multiply it by three (<<$\\frac{1}{2}$x3=>$\\frac{3}{2}$>>). Finally, the last alarm lasts half as long as the previous one. What does this mean? It means the duration would remain $\\boxed{(3 \\times 2)}$ twice its original size ($\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$), but because it\u2019s halved that means we have to divide it by two (<<$\\frac{3}{2}$/2=>$\\frac{3}{4}$>>). Putting this into words helps visualize what\u2019s happening: the third alarm is three times the first, and then the final duration is halved once. As we mentioned before, the only way to write this in an equation is by putting everything in one of two categories: integer or non-integer",
        " for thrice as long as the previous time (or 12 times). And for the third time, it rang for 6 times. So in total, it ranged 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. The answer is: 22.",

        " for the second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. We know the second ringing session lasted 3 longer than the first, which we know was 4 minutes. Therefore the second ringing session would take (<<4+3=7>>7) minutes in total. Finally, the final ringing session took half as long as the second. So this third session is equal to (<<7/2=3.5>>3.5) minutes. Adding these together we can see the final solution is 4 + 7 + 3.5 or ~$\\boxed{14.5}$~ rings total.",
        " 4 times longer than the 1st ringing session and also 2 times as long as the 2nd ringing session, then the third ringing session would be 4 * 2 = 8 times as long as the 1st ringing session. This means the 3rd ringing session lasted 8 times the duration of the 1st ringing session. The last statement says that the 3rd ringing session was half as long as the 2nd ringing session. So the 3rd ringing session would be 8/2 = 4 times as long as the 2nd ringing session (or in other words, 4/4 of the duration of the 2nd ringing session). Hence the first ringing session would last 1/8 the duration of the 3rd ringing session. Then the first ringing session lasts 1 / 8  *  1 / 4 which is equal to 1 / 32. Therefore, there are 32 total ringings in all. The answer is: 32.",

        " find the number of sounds it made in the first round, we can take one-half of this number because twice this value would equal six (<<12=2*6>>), which means that the first round was one-half as short as the final one: <<first:12/2|final:12|half(12/2)=6>>.
