So he traveled 6 times slower than when going from point A to point B, which means that he covered 30*1.6 = 48 miles from point B to point A. His whole trip took up 8 hours of time. Let's look at this graph: https://ibb.co/ZyCtB7P, the horizontal axis represents hours, the vertical axis represent kilometers traveled, the blue line represents Tom's voyage, while the red one represents his return trip. The first part of the blue line takes up 8 units of the horizontal axis (represented by 3), while the second one takes up 12 units (represented by 5). In order to find out what percentage of the whole period Tom spent going towards point B and what he spent traveling back from point B to point A, we can divide each of these two parts into halves by drawing two vertical lines: https://ibb.co/dKVwVmH. Then let\u2019s draw a rectangle that touches these four new segments, which means that its area represents the total time spent on this journey. This rectangle\u2019s height will be equal to the entire vertical length of the red segment (12 units represented by 5 in the horizontal axis) and its width will be 8 divided by 2 (4 units represented by 2). So the rectangle\u2019s area will be 8/2*12 or simply put 8*6=48. Therefore the blue part of the red line represents a half of Tom\u2019s journey. This means Tom spend 48/48 or 1 hours out of 8 traveling from point A to point B, and he spent 40/48 or 8/12 hours (about 2/3 of the whole journey\u2019s duration) traveling from point B to point A, because he traveled slower while returning.

Because D cannot equal zero, we ignore it and simplify our answer further. We get 16 hours / D.

His speed decreases by 10 - 6 = 4 during the trip. This change in speed means that it would take 4 * t2 = D / 6 hours to cover the same distance at his new speed of 6. Since he is sailing back towards point A, it takes the same amount of time to go forward and backwards from B as it took to go from A -> B because we are dealing with round trips.

He returned by traveling at a speed of 6 miles per hour. So let's calculate how far away he is right now from point A on this return journey. Since his current speed is 6m/h, if he traveled for one hour (which would make sense because it's now 5pm), he will be 6 miles closer to Point A than his starting point when going forward. However, since Point B was 40 miles away from point A during their original journey as discussed earlier, then he would only need another 6 hours of traveling before reaching point A again!

Solving that equation results in x = 360 minutes which represents 6 hours, which means Tom took six hours sailing from point A to point B. Now, since Tom travels at a different speed from point B back to point A (i.e., 6mph instead of 10mph) we still don't know yet exactly how long it would take him to travel back home but now we know enough information about our initial equation so let us plug it into another function that helps us determine what time is it actually going to take Tom to complete this journey back towards home.: 6m/h x (4PM\u2212360minutes)=6PM . Since I want to find out how long does it takes him return home , it means 6PM \u2013 4PM = 2PM. Therefore, taking all these facts into account 1pm \u2212 4pm +2pm = 3pm .

Because he travelled 1/3rd as fast back to home compared to going out, he also needed to travel 3x as long.  30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Finally, the sum of these times will provide us with the total time it took to complete the journey. To conclude, it would take Tom 3 hours and 2/3 hours (1/3 hours) to go back (distance divided by speed equals time). Therefore, 3+1/3=4. The answer is: 4.",
        " time he spent traveling: 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles total distance. Next, let\u2019s consider how long it took him to return home. His new speed was 6 miles per hour and we still have 3 hours available, so 6 times 3 equals 18 miles total. Therefore, Tom\u2019s trip lasted 30 + 18 minutes or 48 minutes overall because he had to drive both ways! That means that he arrived at about 4:45 p.m., not bad considering how far away Point B was!",
        " A to B was 30 miles. Similarly, we can figure out the distance from Point B to Point A is equal to 60 miles (his speed was 6 miles per hour multiplied by 10 hours because the time between Point B and A is half of the time between A and B). Now, we can add the 60 miles he traveled when coming back plus the 30 miles from original trip. That would be 90 miles total. To find how long it took him to come back, divide 90 by his speed (6 mph), which gives us the answer: 15. So it took Tom 15 hours to get back home. The answer is: 15.",
        ". Using the formula for speed and time D = RT, it can be calculated as 10D hours. Next, because Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, the equation DT = 6 can be created, where T represents time traveled. Solving for T, T = 6D/10. Adding those together, the equation T+T = 6D/10+10D/10=16D/10 or 1.6D gives the complete time required for the journey.",

Speed is D divided by 4.  Now we have the distance and the speed, so we can figure out the time to go from point b to point c (when he was returning). 4/D hours = 4 hours (when he was going at 10 mph.) Now we have the total time he needs to reach the destination. The answer is: 4.",

Then to compute this value we multiply these values together so D * 3 hrs = 10 mph, making both sides equal (which happens to be how you solve for unknown variables!). This gives us our final answer of DT=VT which translates into distance = speed times amount of time spent traveling. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we use his original distance formula again substituting 6 miles per hour for Velocity since this is what he is going at when returning home (so v*t still equals d). Therefore solving once more yields DT=VT yielding 6milesx6hrs=36 miles(answer given above). Therefore overall journey takes about 30 minutes longer than anticipated due do differences in velocity during their initial voyage vs return trip; however overall duration isn't too drastically altered despite variations over specific segments along route .",

Going this second time it will be 2 hours, since 6 miles per hour is faster than traveling back with the current. Distance = speed x time = 6 miles/hr * 2 hours = 12 miles. Add these two distances together, the sum is 30 + 12 = 42 miles. Lastly we take 42 miles / 10 miles/hr and get 42 / 10 which is equal to 4 hours and 24 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in one hour). The answer is: 4 hours and 24 minutes.",

Next, we add how long it takes him to come back. It takes him twice as long, so we double his speed and subtract that from the hours he would normally need to come back. So 6*2 = 12.

So we know that 30 miles = n * 6 mph and therefore n = 5 hours. Then when Tom came back he travelled for 5 hours at a speed of 6 miles per hour, so his total time spent travelling would have been 8 hours (4 hours plus the 5 hours when he came back). We can use our formula again to calculate 5 hours * 6mph = 30 miles, meaning Tom travelled 30 miles before he turned around and travelled back for another 30 miles which means he used up all his fuel since he started traveling when it was 1PM(i.e. 13 hours after sunrise), so 13 hours + 8 hrs = 21 hours or three o clock in the morning when he finally got home.

Finally, we need to solve this algebraic equation for the unknown value of s : (2) s \u279c Time \u279c 30 \u00f7 s \u279c 30 . Multiplying both sides by s gives us 30 \u279c 30 .

In other words, distance = miles*(speed*time), with the distance being 60 miles, the speed being 10 miles per hour, and the time being 3 hours. This yields a distance of 10 miles per hour times 3 hours, which equals 30 miles. So it took Tom four hours to go from point A to point B.

Replacing the distance with 60 miles, the speed with 6 miles per hour, and the time with 3 hours again yields an equation of 10 miles per hour times 3 hours, which equals 30 miles.

Remember that fraction notation means \u201cdivided by\u201d: (X/Y) or X / Y. If I say 1/2 of 12 is 6, that also translates into 6 equal to 12/2. We want to find how far apart point B and point C are by seeing how many parts of 2/3 is equal to 60. To figure that out, you can simply say 60 divided by 2/3 is equal to 100, so (X/Y) X times Y equals the original number divided by the new fraction: 60 / (2/3) times 3/2 equals 60 / 1. When you multiply this by 3/2, you get 150, which is how much farther apart point B and point C are from each other than point A and B are from each other.

        "hrs, so distance = rate x time = (10m/hr)x(3hr) = 30mi. That Means He Traveled 30 Miles From Point A to Point B. When he turns around and heads back to Point A from point B in a new direction, remember this time he is still traveling at 10mph but traveling backward not forward. So lets apply our formula again... distance = (rate x time) = (10mph x hr) = 10mi. Therefore we know that he traveled a total distance equal to the distance it would take to go straight to the destination (30mi) plus the backwards distance (10mi). Since they are both measured in miles, you just have to add them. 30 + 10 = 40 So he ended up traveling a total of 40 miles!",
