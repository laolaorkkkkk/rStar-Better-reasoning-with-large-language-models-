        " there are 8 * 15 = 120 units in the building. Next let's find the number of unoccupied units. Of the building 3/4 is occupied, which leaves 1/4 as not occupied. If 1/4 of the units are not occupied, then 1/4 of the 120 units are not occupied. So 1/4 of 120 is 120 / 4, or 30. Finally since there are 30 unoccupied units in the whole building, the total number of units is 120 - 30 = 90. The answer is: 90.",
        " 120$. Next, we need to find out how many floors are occupied. We can do this by multiplying 3/4 times the number of floors, or 3/4 times 15, which is 11. So 15 floors minus 11 floors that are occupied leaves $15 - 11$ = 4 unoccupied floors. Multiply 4 floors by 8 units per floor to get the total number of unoccupied units in the building, which is $4 \\times 8 = 32$. The answer is: 32.",

        " 120$ . Next, since 3/4 of the building is occupied and we don't know whether it's more than or less than half of the total units, then we need to take both cases into account and add them. One case is that less than half of the total units are occupied. In this case we would only consider 3/4 of the occupied units, because we want to count just those that aren't occupied. That would mean we would consider $(3/4) \\times (120 / 2)$ . We take half here because otherwise we'd double-count the ones closer to the halfway point between the bottom and top floors. The other case is if more than half of the total units are occupied. In this case we also want to double-check that there isn't an entire floor full of just empty apartments. This means that if all units in that floor are empty, they would not contribute to our calculation at all. In the worse case scenario, this could leave us overestimating the amount of vacant units in the building. Therefore we subtract one full unit for every floor. To find this number, first we calculate how many total full units are on each floor, which is $\\frac{1}{8} \\times 8$, since there are 8 total units on each floor and $\\frac{1}{8}$ of these units may be empty. Then we multiply this by the number of floors, which is 15 to get $15 \\times \\frac{1}{8}$. This will tell us the total amount of full units across every floor. Finally we subtract this value from the previous calculation we made (since we didn't include any extra floors) to arrive at the amount remaining: $(3/4) \\times (120 / 2) - 15 \\times (1/8)$, which simplifies to 60.
