But if she was coached, her earnings would be $1,050 per week. So to solve this problem you first need to find out how many hours per week she is teaching (35) divided by how much she earns for teaching (700) to get 35 \u00f7 700 = 0.05 or 5%.

Note: You cannot leave any fractional values, so the result needs to be multiplied by 100. Therefore 0.05 becomes 5% and 0.01428571429 becomes 1.43%. Therefore Jill's earnings from coaching can be calculated by taking the remaining percentage (100 \u2013 5% \u2013 1.43%) from the total, which comes to 93.57%.
