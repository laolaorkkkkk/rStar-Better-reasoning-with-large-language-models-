        " W and L, or W + L = 22. And we also know that W must be larger than L, as they won more than they lost. Suppose W = X. Then L must be smaller than X, and the difference between them must be 8. This means X - L = 8. Solving for L, we get L = X - 8. We can plug this into our equation W + L = 22, and rearrange it to get 2W = X. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2(2W) = 2X, which simplifies to 4W = 2X. Dividing both sides by 4, we finally get W = 2X/4 = X/2. Since X is a variable, and we didn't specify any value for it, the most general solution is that W could be any integer multiple of one half (either positive or negative), such as 1/2, -3/2, ... . However, since L has to be less than W, we can rule out the case when W is negative. Therefore, the only possible values for W are all positive integers greater than zero that are divisible by 2 (other than 2 itself). These include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, .... The total number of different possible answers is infinite. The answer is: [2, 4, 6, 8, ...]",

        " (we cancel out l) (2l+8)-8=(22)-(8) Now if we go left with the 2 and down with the 8, the right hand side becomes what it was originally: 2x=14 We need to solve for l. Using 8=-2l and substituting in we get -2l=14+(-2) (-2)(-2l)=14+(2) (4l)=14+4 (4l)=18 Divide by 4 on both sides => l=4.5 (round to nearest whole value) Thus, our answers will be Losses: 4 Win: 15 (win=loss+8) (15,4) Therefore we just add up wins and losses which is simply 15",

        " games played. x x means games played We are told x = 22 and the team won \"x\" - 8 more than the number they lost. Therefore x = 22 We can see that if x = 22 then the number of games won will be 15 because 22 - 8 = 14 or more simply stated (x-8) which equates to the number of games the team won since the equation reads: \"We have $x$ - 8 more than the number we lost.\" 7 + 8 = 15 Games Won Total Number Of Games Played (including ties) x = 22 Wins x-8 = Total Games =22 - l = 22 so L = 8 Losses Since $x$ + $x$ + 8 =22; Or simplified results in: $x$ = 14 We can see that if x = 14 then the number of games won will be 22 - 14 = 8 so the total games won will be 8. Therefore 8 + 8 is 16 games played (8 games lost) Wins Games Played So total of $x$ = 22 $x$ wins $l$ losses $22$ = $14$ = $22-l$ Winnings Games Played The team loses eight more games than it wins:$16-l=22$",

        " vi       vii     viii     ix    x   The numbers are x, x+8, 22. The last equation shows us that our original variable x represents the number of games they lost; this means it can be substituted into any place within the expression above such as x+8 or 22 for example. Using what was determined earlier, here's where it gets tricky because not only will you need your original value but also those corresponding values for wins (x+8) losses (x), and total games played which happens to equal 22(2*x)+(x*2)+(x*2)=4x+3x+3x=6x+3x^2=6x^2+6. Therefore solving this problem entails rearranging these expressions so you end up with only one unknown quantity which happens to have different coefficients. Rearranging yields: (6) - ((3) * 1/2)   ->  2*x^2 +  4*x   +3  =>  2x^2 + 4x + 3. By the time you finish rearranging, this polynomial represents a quadratic equation and its general form looks something like y=ax^2+bx+c. When all variables are known, finding zeros of polynomials become simple enough as well since most textbooks provide tables containing answers for common values like x=1 or x=-2 etcetera so long as coefficient 'a' doesn't come too close to being zero itself otherwise there may still be no easy solution whatsoever regardless how large our algebra skills are at times ;o/. In conclusion , solving this particular quadratic involves finding appropriate roots that solve said function without having any pesky fractions floating around inside because they could potentially lead one astray when applying them onto other problems as well. In fact , root finding for quadratics often occurs within other branches related directly with it such like complex analysis where real numbers exist side-by-side alongside imaginary ones ."
