The problem tells us that the bush has \u201cscattered\u201d berries on it, but not that all of the berries are visible. There may still be some hidden under the leaves. We therefore consider them all as part of the total. Also, while the question asks about \u201craspberries\u201d, the berries are described as being red. If one looks closely, raspberries actually come in many colors, including white (yes, really), yellow, pink, purple and more. Most people think of red ones, though, because they are typically available year round in markets. Because of this, we assume that when the question says to consider \u201call raspberries\u201d, it is referring only to those that are red in color, which is the most common type sold. With this clarification in mind, let\u2019s check our work again. Remember, we said that there were $120$ berries in the clusters plus the $67$ that were scattered across the bush. The total number of raspberries (including what was considered \u201chidden\u201d) was then $187$. Our updated number can be determined using the same strategy. In other words, we will compute $(120\\color{red}{+}67)\\color{red}{+}\\text{(number of \u201chided\u201d berries)}$, so we can use a different symbol for the \u201chiding\u201d part. Using the new symbol, $\\boxed{\\color{blue}{H}}$, we can rewrite our expression as follows: $120\\color{red}{+}67+\\color{blue}{H}$. Let\u2019s add up these three terms: $$(120\\color{red}{+}67)+\\color{blue}{H}=187+\\color{blue}{H}=187\\color{blue}{+H}.$$ Since $120+67+H=187+H$, and 187 and H together equal the answer, $187+H$.
