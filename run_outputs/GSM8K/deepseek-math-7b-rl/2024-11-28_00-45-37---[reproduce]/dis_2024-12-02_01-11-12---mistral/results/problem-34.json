We can find them using this formula \"a = y/2 + 2\", where a stands for aaron's gems. This means that siobh\u00c3\u00a1n's gems would be calculated like this: \"siobh\u00c3\u00a1n's gems = aaron's gems - 2\" or \"siobh\u00c3\u00a1n's gems = (y/2 + 2) - 2\".

This is because 5(x) for jewels means 5 multiplied by x, which represents the number of aaron's jewels. So x * 5 = x + x + x + x + x, resulting in 5x or 15.
