        " Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles, we also have that $L=G+2$, where $L$ is the time it takes for Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles, using the original formula. However, the new formula says that Gerald, with the improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles one-tenth (1/10) faster than when he originally was running them. Using this new formula, we can set up the equation below. $$L=\\frac{G}{10}+\\frac{38}{10}$$ Now, let's use what we already know about $L$. We have seen that $L$ equals $G+2$ from above, so we can say that $$\\frac{G}{10}+\\frac{38}{10}=G+2$$ Expanding out, we find that $$\\frac{G+20}{10}=G+2.$$ Next, multiplying both sides by $10$, we get $$G+20=10G+20.$$ Combining like terms, we obtain that $8G=-20$, so $G=-(20/8)=-(2.5)$. Thus, if Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in $-2.5$ seconds, since Gerald's time can be negative due to the change in his diet. (However, if Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds or less, then it is physically impossible for Gerald to ever run the 400-meter hurdles in any amount of time.)",
        " that Gerald can run them in 38+2=40 seconds. This also tells us that $G=40$. We also know that $G/100 \\times 1.1 = 38$, so $G=(38)(100) / (1.1)=34545$, and we want the time of running with an improved diet. We have $(34545/100)\\times 1.1= 38$, so $G = 38$.",
        " took $G - 2$, Gerald took $G$. This allows us to express the proportion $latex\\frac{2}{G - 2}$ as a percentage. Converting that expression, we get $\\frac{(G - 2) \\times 100\\%}{(G - 2)} = 10\\%$. Rearranging this expression and substituting our initial equation yields the following: $latex 10 = (G - 2)\\times 100\\%/(G - 2)$. This simplifies to $latex G=18$. Therefore, Gerald ran the 400-meter hurdles in 18 seconds. The answer is: 18.",
        " 38 \\\\ \\Rightarrow G = 40 $$ This means that prior to his change in diet, Gerald would take 40 seconds. To determine the amount of time it would take after having changed his diet for 10%, let's add 10% to the original 40 seconds, so $$ G(1+0.1) = 40 + .4 \\\\ \\Rightarrow G(1.1) = 40.4 \\\\ \\Rightarrow G = 36.73 $$ So if Lee were able to beat Gerald by 2 seconds in the 400 meter hurdle, but once Gerald changes his diet, Gerald would only be beaten by less than a second.",
        ", in this case is 38 seconds; we can write in our first equation that $L$=38, and solve for what $G$ must be: $G$=$L$+2=$38$+2=$40$.  Now, we just need to figure out what $G*1.1$ must be, meaning we are taking the original time $G$, or the time Gerald ran the race when Lee was running it at least 2 seconds faster than him, and changing his original time upwards by ten percent so that we get his new speed. Once again, let\u2019s create another equation to help us understand this:   $\\text{G*1.1}=\\text{X}$ , where X represents what we don\u2019t know at the moment. Solving for $X$ yields: $G$=$X$/$1.1$, but we already know that $G$=$40$, so we can rewrite our second equation: $\\text{40} = \\frac{\\text{X}}{\\text{1.1}}$, and solving gives us $X$=$44$. Therefore, we know that Lee currently can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, while Gerald can run them in 44 seconds! The answer is: 44.",

        " equation 2 to substitute the value from your table into the right side of our original equation, 33.54-2.02=31.52. You should also be aware that since we are dealing with a per person increase, there are only two people involved in this situation (the boss and worker), meaning 31.52 is equal to the cost per person ($C$). Once we obtain $C$, we need to find the percent change from $c$, the current cost per person. If you look back at equation 2 you know that $p_1=(0.7)(c)$ and $p_2=(c+4)$. To determine percent increase in the cost you use $PI=(\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}\\times{100})$. Here you need to determine the difference in price, this is found using $\\Delta p=p_2-p_1$ (and plugging into the formula for PI). When we do this using the information above $\\Delta p=4-(0.7)(c)-0.7(33.54)+4=1.354<1.4$. So, your boss will notice a roughly 1.4% increase in price.

In our case though, we instead want to find the addition to his original time, rather than subtracting away that amount. To get that number of seconds as well, take Gerald\u2019s starting time (or his \u201cold\u201d self) and multiply it by the percentage converted to a decimal (we use $x$ to indicate what the time will be): $(40\\times 0.1)=4$.

In summary the solution can be written as follows: $L = (\\text{G}-2) = 38$, $G_{\\text{new}}=(\\text{G}\\cdot .9)=36$, $G=(40)$, and G is originally equal to 40 seconds. The answer is: 36.",

        " Gerald gaining speed rather than his speed increasing can be useful, as it puts a face on what you\u2019re actually working on solving for: Gerald's running time as compared to his prior self! You can also use other strategies, such as creating equations, to solve for the amount of time (in seconds) that Gerald spent running the four hundred-meter hurdle race. To get started, you'll need to set up a proportional relationship based on the fact that if Gerald gains speed, say he gained 10%, then for every minute he should run he will now gain back 0.1 of a second (or 0.01 of a minute). The proportional relationship becomes the foundation upon which all of your calculations depend: it ensures that both Gerald and his upgraded diet run times correspond to each other. If we multiply his initial running time of four minutes with the proportion factor of 0.1, we get 0.4 minutes extra running time for him; since this conversion involves minutes instead of seconds, however, we need to divide it out into decimals and then finally multiplied again by 60 in order to get his new running time of four hundred meters in terms of seconds:   4 \u2022 0.1/0.01 = 0.4 \u2022 60 =  24\\text{seconds}. Using this formula gives you Lee\u2019s new running time when improved by 10% on top of his previous time: 40s\u22124s=36\u2009 s.",
        ".   We can also use F to represent the factor that the Gerald improves himself.   If we know FG is 10% better than the original speed, then we must have (1+0.1)*FG=(1+0.1)*1.1*G=(1+0.1)*(1+0.1)*G=(1.1+0.1*0.1)*G=(1.21G)*1.10=1.33G.   At the same time, FL=G\u22122.   1.33G=(G\u22122).   Thus G=1.33*(G\u22122).   Solve this equation,  G=10/7.   10/7 is equivalent to 1.4 seconds as running speed, and so the Gerald with improved diet, in seconds can finish a 400 meter hurdle race within 10/7 sec.

        " [1] would yield us: $\\text{G}=40$seconds or just a little under one full minute since it is only 40 seconds. Because he changed his diet though, we can say that his speed improved by 10% which makes $\\text{G}$ faster. This change in speed should also make him faster for a 400 meter hurdle race since all factors contributing to him winning this race are related to running speed such as distance, amount of hurdles, etc. To keep track of how he improved his time, we could use his initial time,$\\text{G}$, and compare it to his new time, $\\hat{G}$. Thus, making the formula below (Equation [2]) true, where a represents improvement due to changed diet. $a=\\frac{(\\hat{\\text{G}} -\\text{ G})}{\\text{G}}$ We already know $\\text{G}=40$, meaning that you can rewrite the above equation for $\\text{G}$ using $\\text{T} \\equiv 40$ . $\\hat{\\text{G}} \\cong \\text{T}+\\text{T}a$, or simply $\\hat{\\text{G}} \\cong \\text{ T}+40a$. Now since Lee was initially faster by 2 seconds before Gerald changed his diet, it becomes apparent that his new time, $\\hat{\\text{G}}$, is faster than G but less than L. Therefore we can express our second equation as: $\\text{L}=\\hat{\\text{G}}+2$, or equivalently $\\text{L}\\cong\\text{T}+40a+2$ Plugging our first equation $\\text{T}+40a$ for $\\hat{\\text{G}}$ into the second equation yields our third and final equation: $\\text{T}-\\text{T}+40a+2 = \\text{T}+38$, or equivalently $40a=38$, which in turn produces $a=\\frac{38}{40}$, where $a$ now represents his percent increase in speed. This means that he is now running $14\\%$ faster. Substituting $a=\\frac{38}{40}$ back into either equations [2] or [1], as a way of checking if this makes sense, results in: $\\text{G}-2=\\frac{38}{40",

Therefore, $(11/10)\u00d736=38.4$. And because Gerald is running 304 m (0.304 km), then 300-m (0.3-km) and 306-m (0.306-km) distances are equal to him, Gerald will spend about 38.4 minutes per lap, i.e., 36 minutes less than our original estimate! The amount difference in these times depends upon whether we used to use exact or rounded numbers; however, there isn\u2019t much difference when comparing results because they come up within a second or two either way. Since LEE took 36% of original GERALDs time before he improved it 10%, and the current LEEDOES 400 meter hurdles in $((400\u00d760+38)\u00f7(220\u00d760))$seconds. Then LEE takes ((gerald + 2)\u00d760 + 38) / (Lee + 11) seconds = 57.636 seconds, which rounds off at 58. We know lee runs two seconds faster, so now with our answer we can solve for gerald in seconds.

So, we see a direct relationship between Lee's overall time and the number of seconds it takes him for each lap. His time equals his laps multiplied by four, divided by ten. This leads me to believe the total amount of time taken by anyone racing against them would also increase proportionally to their laps divided by ten plus four! To make sure I'm correct about this, we need numbers since our example above uses decimal digits instead of integers; then, we would expect something similar here too-  for every additional lap taken at this pace per hour equals six mins and twenty seconds total over sixty minutes! Let's use those values as well since we are going off what has already happened beforehand without considering other factors such as terrain difficulties etc.,which may impact things further down line... So based upon these calculations now let's apply them onto Gerald's improved dietary regimen. We know that if Gerald had not made any changes at all, then they would finish their run within just 13 minutes - which is quite impressive considering most people cannot go faster than 28min/mile pace during races like these!! However; since there has been an improvement, this value should decrease accordingly - perhaps somewhere around 12mins instead. With these figures in mind now let's see where the math falls short with respects  to whether or not Gerald  will still remain ahead  0f  lee after taking into account both improvements together !

Hence a lap would take three seconds to complete or thirty six seconds for four which we divided by 4 earlier (4 seconds per lap improvement times 4 laps equaling the total time saving which we use to bring our original 40 seconds figure back up to a nice round 40.)

Thus proving my theory that the answer is not 36 secs..it has to be 38 secs!!!

So to calculate gerald sped at 1.5% plese calulate g=40 at the rate of 1.5% we see that g increases by 1.5 2/100 or 0.015 and thus g increases by 0.015 and thusg is calculated as 41.9. So finally Geralss current timetaken is 41 in 38 seconds as lee finishes in 38 seconds and he loses t wo so gerryld takes 41 seconds.

        " hurdles, then Lee ran it two seconds faster or in other words, he ran it in G - 2 seconds. Let L represent the amount Gerald changed, and since he got better by improving his diet, L is positive. We know that the new time Gerald can run the 400 meter hurdle with his new diet is G + L, because he was getting 10% of improvement. Therefore, when he got better with 10%, he improved his time as follows: (G+L) - G = L. This tells us that Gerald improved his time of running the 400 meters by L seconds. In other words, his new time was L seconds faster than before. That means that Lee's new time would be (G - 2 + L). Also, if we let the new time Gerald can run the 400 meter hurdles now be Y, we know that Y equals to L seconds faster than G, therefore we have Y - G = L. Solving both of these equations together, we get that Y = G - 2 + L. Substituting our Y value into this equation, since Y = 38, we can obtain that 38 = G - 2 + L, thus G = 38 + 2 - L, so G = 40 - L. Since L represents the improvement he got from changing his diet, and since he got 10%, L will be 0.1G. Substituting this into the equation above, we get that G = 40 - 0.1G. Solving for G, we get G = 400/9, since 0.1 is equal to 1/10 and therefore multiplying by 10/10 will be equivalent to multiplying by 1. 10/10 is also known as the number 1 multiplied by itself 10 times, which means 1*1*1*1*...*10x's. Because of the number 10 in this numerator, the fraction reduces to being 40/9. Therefore, the answer would be 40/9 seconds.",

We also know that if we increase anything by 10%, we multiply it by 110%. So we let R represent the new amount of time it takes Gerald to run the 400 meters using his diet change. Because R represents the time it takes Gerald with a diet change, it should be equal to 30( 110% )/ ( 100% ). To find our solution, we solve the equation below. 30 * 1.1 / .1 = 330 seconds.

After changing his diet, his new running time became 1.1 * 40 = 44 seconds. To complete the question, simply subtract the new time from the initial one, giving us the difference, 40 - 44 = -4 seconds.

So now we know that 38 equals 44/10 so our X is 44 divided by ten which will come out equal to eight years old now instead twelve as we previously figured out; therefore making our equation 36=56-(4*X)-(38)/10 equals 36 equals 56-4X-38/10 equals 36 equals 56 minus three eights plus thirty eight divided by ten times X . . .

After improving his diet Gerald's time improved by roughly around 10% of that original number. Since we already know the original number is equal to (38-2) seconds then the only other way we could find out is if we multiply that initial number by .1 which stands for 10%.

        " Gerald now--well previous new calculated formula will hold true here too ie, geralds new time will be calculated again..this time including all changes i.e.,first improvement->10 percent ->4 seconds then another modification-> 2second difference due to change in his/her diets (since lee was two seconds slower than gerald);so final calculation process could go somewhat like this....gerald's final timing = 40 + 4+(new calculated speed by using old timings ----which was nothing but 10 percent improvements--which stands @gerald's new improved speed --> 40+(2+4)= 46 second",
        "If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds? GERRAR CAN RUN AT 36 SECOND IN 400 METER HURDLES AFTER MODIFICATION...So that shall be the answer of question!"
