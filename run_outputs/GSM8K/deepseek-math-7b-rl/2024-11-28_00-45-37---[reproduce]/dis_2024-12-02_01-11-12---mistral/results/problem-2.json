When we say a house price went up or down 150%, this means the house increased by 1.5 times (or 150%) the initial value of the house ($80,000). So the new house value should be 150% of 80K = $80000*1.5 = 120,000 dollars! Great job calculating correctly! Finally, once we know both our costs ($130,000) as well as what our house sold for ($120,000) when all was said and done - there is our profit :)) which equals 120-130=(-10,000). Our result shows this property actually lost -10K due to costs associated with repairs etc., but not to worry since we still have our house which is worth quite significantly more than before any work had taken place! I hope that helped and remember to always keep things simple while problem solving! Cheers : )",

Lastly, subtracting the first price from our final product ($325K \u2013 $80K) gives us exactly what needed - $245 thousand in cash flow which shows up as profits (or gains).

        " value of the house is. Since we know its value was increased by 150%, this means that its original value is 1/1.15 (or .87) of the new value, since an increase by 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.15. Thus, if the new value is V, then (V / 1.15) = V*.87. Rearranging, you get V = (V*.87)/(1.15) = 3/4V. Since both sides equal $130,000 we can say that $130,000 = 3/4*130,000 = $97,500.

So that means that all in all Josh put in $130k (his initial investment plus the cost of repairs) and then got $120k when selling the home. So his profit was $130,000 minus $120,000, which was $10k.

So the new value of the house (also called sale price) would be $130,000 + ($80,000 x 1.5), which equals $270,000. And finally, as mentioned before, profit is calculated as the difference between sale price (here -$270,000) and investment (here $130,000). So overall, Josh made a profit of $270,000 - $130,000 = $140,000. Hopefully this helps! Let me know if anything is unclear or needs further explanation.: 285{,}000, 195{,}000, 85{,}000. First, you need to find out what the initial price was. The initial price is the amount that the house was sold for, but we don't know how much it was purchased for because we weren't around when it was purchased. Next, figure out how much the house increased in value over time. You can easily determine this by figuring out the percentage increase. If the house was purchased at one point and then sold again 10 years later and if the selling prices were both $10,000, then the 2 houses have the same value (value = 10,000 + (10,000 - 5,000)). You can figure out that the percentage increase is 5/10, or 1. Then, use our knowledge about percentages (the base amount that an item starts at times the percentage increase) to calculate how much money Josh could make from these transactions without any other expenses involved other than buying and selling houses, etc.... Let's say he purchased one house at 5k, increased its value by 150%, sold another one at 10k increased its value by 200% and sold a third one at 15k increased its value by 350%. The profit is $150K = $15,000 - $3000.",

So the total cost of buying the house and doing repairs is $130,000. Next, we can figure out what percentage increase the value of the house saw due to the repairs. We know that 150% means that the house is worth three times its original value. So if the initial value of the house was $80,000, its new value after repairs would be $3 \u00d7 $80,000 = $240,000. However, we already know that it is worth $325,000, so we need to do one last calculation. To find how much more it\u2019s worth after the repairs, we need to subtract the previous value ($240,000) from the new one ($325,000). The result is $325,000 \u2013 $240,000 = $85,000. And this $85,000 is exactly the amount of profit Josh made from selling the house and getting back all his investment + more.",
        " increased the value of the house by 150%, which means 150% of the initial amount. When you increase something by 150%, you multiply it by 1.5. Therefore the new house value, with all these increases applied, becomes $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000. That's how we get Josh's estimated total profit. However, we haven't taken into account what the selling price could be. Remember that any real estate transaction also includes commission for the agent who sells the property. Let's say the commission is 6% of the selling price. 6% of our new house worth ($195,000) is 195,000 * 0.06 = $11,700, so Josh's total cost including commissions is $130,000 + $50,000 + $11,700 = $201,700. Subtracting that figure from the new house value, we find the new profit margin: $195,000 - $201,700 = $-6,700So after subtracting the commission fee, the actual profit turned out to be negative. As a result, Josh has lost $6,700 instead of earning them!",
        " multiply the original investment by 1.5 to get our new, or 'current', value. The current value is the sale price that the buyer would pay for the house. This would mean our new value of the house is $$=$130{,}000\\times1.5=130{,}000+130{,}000=260{,}000$$. When the house is sold at the $260,000 price, it will still not earn profits yet. It must sell at a higher value than what Josh paid for it to get any kind of profit. Because our new value of the house is $260,000, the minimum we want it to sell at to actually get back the money we put into it is the same. To get just your investment back out, the minimum selling price must be at least $$=$260{,}000$+($80{,}000+\\$50{,}000)$=\\$390,000.$$. Therefore, if the house sells anywhere above $390,000, Josh will get all his money back, including his initial investment and all the money he spent on repairs. Any additional amount above this will become extra profit for him as a result. For example, if the house sold at $460,000, he would receive a total of $460,000 minus his initial investment of $130,000 and his spending on repairs of $50,000 which totals to $180,000. Thus, the amount of profit he would make is $$\\text{Profit}=\\$460,000-\\$130{,}000-\\$50{,}000=$$$$280,000-\\$(\\$80{,}000+\\$50{,}000)=\\$65,000$$.",

Next, the new value or selling price is 150% higher than the initial cost. To obtain this new value, we multiply 150% or 1.50 by the initial cost ($130,000). Using basic percentage formulas to solve for our unknown values, the formula for percentage increase is \"% Increase\" = \"Original Price\" / \"New Price\" \u00d7 100, whereas percentage decrease is \"% Decrease\" = ((\"Old Price\" - \"New Price\") / \"Old Price\") \u00d7 100. By substituting the necessary variables from the problem into these formulas, we can derive answers for each equation. Applying percentage formulas for each question yields: Percentage increase: 150% = $80,000/$130,000\u00d7100 = 61.53%, so if it increased by 150%, then it would be 61.53% more than before. Therefore, since percentage represents the ratio of 2 numbers, the initial value divided by percentage gives us the answer. Final Value = (Initial Value / Percent Increase)\u00d7100 \u21d2 $80,000/1.50\u00d7100 = $533,333. Thus, the final value of $533,333 represents an increase of 150%.",

Next, let's compute the new value of the house after all the renovations by multiplying $130,000 (the starting price) by 150%, or $$=$$$130{,}000\\times1.5=195{,}000$.

        ", let's convert this amount into percentage terms. When we buy a product or service, it often comes with a certain discount, such as 10% or 20%. However, here we see \"increased\" instead of \"discounted,\" which signifies that the original house price (not just repairs) increased by 150%, implying a 150% increase in value. With a change in percentage, we multiply the figure by the new percentage, resulting in a new value. So, if the original house cost $130,000, increasing the value by 150% would yield: $130,000 \u00d7 150\\% = $130,000 \u00d7 1.5 = $195,000. We know that the seller gets their full investment back once they sell it for a profit. Therefore, our calculation of profit should reflect that they get their full investment back first before calculating any additional profit. So, if we subtract the selling price ($195,000) from our total expenses, including both the cost of purchasing ($80,000) and repairing the house ($50,000), it will equal the seller's profit. As a result, the profit can be calculated by subtracting the initial investment plus repair costs ($130,000) from the sale price ($195,000): $195,000 \u2212 $($80,000 + $50,000) = $65,000.

We can see that the sale price was $325,000. The sale amount can also be found by subtracting the total investment from the selling price: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.
