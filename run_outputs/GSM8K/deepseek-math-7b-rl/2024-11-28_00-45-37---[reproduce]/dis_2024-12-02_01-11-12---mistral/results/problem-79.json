This gives us 38.45 as our answer, rounded up to the nearest cent for ease of readability. The groomer will only be making a profit if they charge more than that. Therefore, their best offer for John should be something like $35 or even less. If they want to make $35 off the dog's grooming fee, they'll have to charge about $40 or so to break even with John's discounted bill. Since that isn't even close enough to the current $42 quote given, I would recommend that the groomer call back and ask John if he wants them to come over and take care of his dog or not before telling him what their final offer might be. It looks like he would prefer if they came right over since he already said yes earlier when asked whether or not he wanted them there!",

The amount of money they lose depends entirely on the price being paid for the goods or services and the discount offered. In this case, if the total cost is going to change to $70. Therefore, the business is out of pocket $30 because the final payout is just $70 when the discount would be applied versus the regular rate of $100. They still earned the same amount even though the amount of money they received has changed (because of a loss to them), but they sold the product at the full price and then later recouped a good chunk of that cash in the way of savings, a benefit to their consumers.

Let\u2019s make it easier: we\u2019ll work backwards from your percent instead. To start, add .1 (10%) onto the initial percentage to get .2 ($20). To keep going, I would like to suggest making it more manageable using rounding up. Instead of $300 rounded down (and then taking out 10%), we could just increase by another percent until it reaches $330 (rounded up to include all $300 as well as the extra $30 we want to add). Now we can see exactly where our desired amount lies within the round numbers: right around $330 (which rounds upwards from the previous number that is under this). Rounding again, we know that taking .1 away from this amount gives an answer of approximately $300 -- this gives us the value of the final amount you paid when rounding down but not before adding in your other percent! Finally, let\u2019s use these steps again to figure out how much you saved compared against what you would have spent without taking advantage of any deals or discount opportunities whatsoever (i.e., if only one deal could be applied). Take note here that since all prices mentioned so far relate directly back into your purchase total ,we don\u2019t have much choice other than rounding everything downwards by just 1% every time something needs adjusting! To start ,the first thing you will notice about these values is something unexpected -- the summation of all numbers seems too large for its actual counterpart which leaves space for error . In short ,there could be anywhere from $40-$50 worth of savings between these two calculations depending on whether you were lucky enough for some luck ,such as finding coupon codes beforehand\u2026or maybe better yet :being aware ahead of time when exactly these promotions occur!

        " he just needs to add back in the extra amount of money from the discount -- > 70+30=$\\boxed{100}$ ! We could also use the formula we used in the previous example by adding 30% to the original grooming cost: $$\\frac{x}{100}\\cdot 70=100.$$ Multiplying through,we get $$100\\div 100$$ $$\\frac{100}{100}=1$$ This means that to get x we must multiply 1 by 70 :$\\frac{70}{1}=\\boxed{70}$ . I hope this made sense...again remember that the 100 we divide by isn\u2019t actually 100 but rather 100%. Since there is no decimal, the multiplier, or coefficient,is just 1. We must first calculate what 30% would look like as a decimal to see how we can manipulate numbers using the multiplicative identity property: $$30\\%=\\frac{30}{100}=\\frac{1}{3}$$ It is important to know how to properly set up division problems if you ever plan on taking your math to the next level! Remember that fractions are ratios so always ensure you have all the correct parts in order :)",

        " The difference in price when compared to the original is the amount of discount John gets. We said the regular grooming fee was $100 and now the amount the groomer charges John is $70...so whats the difference?...$100-$70 =$30. The amount of discount John gets is $30. (Alternatively you can say that 100 minus 70 leaves us 30...30 is how much less John pays than if the full $100 cost was applied) . Hopefully these explanations are simple enough so you get the idea.",

        " change if someone paid you $13.24 and wanted back $11.59 in bills. First we are going to need to calculate the difference of those two numbers by subtracting the smaller one from the larger one...$11.59-$13.24=1.65 ....Now the last thing we gotta figure out what bills to use. Lets break down this amount into pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters\u2026..now in reality there should probably be pennies here but I dont think anyone likes carrying around them so let's make a quick shortcut calculation instead!! Just multiply your original number ($13) by 100....13X100=1300....and then subtract off only the portion over .50 since we have 59 cents left to work with..(.50/2)=.25 ...this leaves us with.........1300-.25=1275! Soooooooooo lets just divide everything by 25 until we get a whole number left over like 52....20*52=1040+17=1057...sooo thats itttttt! All three quarters plus 17 dimes. Now don't forget to ask for your change from whichever bill holder is closest, or who else might be interested in spending some extra cash right about now too ;).

The math to find this percentage is to just take what we got last time and multiply it by what we need: $70(.01)=$.70! And so the insurance cost would simply be that amount again..$.70!. Alright finally lets add it all up!! The initial price is $100. The discount is $30. The Dog tax is $.70 and Insurance is also $.70 making the total: $100+$30+$.70+$.70= $130.70, thats still a decent savings! :)",
