That works because (25/20) is equivalent to 25 / (20*0.01). 25/1 represents what percent of something there is. This means what 25 is 1% of. When multiplied by 0.2 it would be like taking that one part and moving it to another 20% place. So if you have a whole cupcake, this could represent only taking a quarter, or 20% off the cake. It will show the equivalent of what 1/100th (percent) of a whole object is. To get from this to what one piece of the remaining 80% or 85 pieces (if there were 100 total), there would have to be 5 out of 85, or 25%. This is called a decimal proportion.

This means that there are 20.25 good oranges that are also not unripe. To find the total number of good oranges, we simply add 20.25 to the 1 good apple that isn't unripe. Therefore, there are 21.25 good apples overall. Now let's think in terms of numbers instead of apples. First, there were 25 apples. Next, we deducted one apple that was already counted as good. We need to keep subtracting out the bad, rotten, and unripe apples from the 24 remaining apples. One apple was rotten so we took that away from the 24, leaving us with 23. Then, we realize that 20% of the 25 apples were unripe. We only have 23 remaining apples that weren't already taken care of earlier, so that means we need to remove another 20% of them, or .20 * 23 = 4.8 more apples. We took those away so we ended up with 18 apples remaining. Next, we want to check how many apples were unripe. It says in the question that 20% of the 25 are unripe, but we actually looked at the percent of the remaining apples. We removed 1 bad apple, 2 rotten apples, and 4.8 unripe ones. So that means 23 apples were already accounted for when the first 4 sentences talked about, and then another 4.8 apples out of the last 18 weren't good. 23 + 4.8 = 27.8 total unripe apples. But wait, we only looked at how many out of the remaining 18 apples were unripe, meaning we didn't check how many of the original 25 apples were unripe. So, to fix that, we need to",

Lastly there needs to be additional oranges that can make up the difference since there are only 17 apples found earlier classified as being good. What amount would this bring the grand total apples remaining to be found? Well the grand total would be 25 less the numbers already found which are unripe, sour, and bad.

        " rotten, so we have $(25-1)$ healthy ones left. Therefore, $5+(25-1)=31$ are healthy. Now find the number of bad oranges by noting that 4%, i.e., 2 out of the 50 original ones are spoiled. The number of spoiled oranges is therefore $(0.04 \\times 50)=2$. Add the numbers of sour oranges and healthy oranges together to get the number of healthy ones, i.e., 31. The final number of oranges is obtained by adding these quantities together, which results in $2+20+4+67=93$. The proportion (fraction) of healthy ones can also be found as $(31)/(93)$. Since the remaining oranges cannot be unripe, sour, bad, or healthy, it follows that the number of remaining oranges is $(50-(2+20+4+31))=(50-57)=-7$, which shows no oranges remain. As another approach we may multiply $0.20+0.04+0.20=0.44$, which is the fraction of sour, bad oranges among all the non-healthy oranges. So the number of bad oranges is $(0.04 \\times 25)$, which simplifies to $(100 \\times 0.04)-(100 \\times 0.20)=1/2-10=1$, so we have $1-(5+3)+(5-7+5)+(7-1)=-1$. Thus the number of healthy oranges is $(50-(25-1-7+(-1)))=-8$ since $50-(5+3+(-1))=40+2+1-5=21-5=16$. In summary, there are $(17+1+5+3)-21$ healthy oranges. Alternatively, we could use the ratio of the good apples and the total number to determine the total amount of spoilt apples.
