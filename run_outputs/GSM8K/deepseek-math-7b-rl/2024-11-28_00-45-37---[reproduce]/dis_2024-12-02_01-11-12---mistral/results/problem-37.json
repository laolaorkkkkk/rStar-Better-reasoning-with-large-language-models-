This means in order to make $15 from selling legos, John needed to sell more than 13 legos.

Because he had $5 left over from selling the last set, that means he sold the eighth Lego set too low, probably just for the sake of finishing off sales. The answer is: The correct answer here would be that he sold 7 sets. Since he was selling one per day, there is no way he sold 8 sets in a row when none are in stock.
