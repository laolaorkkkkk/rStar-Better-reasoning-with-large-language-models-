We know that 2/3*10= 10x2/3=6.6 and 3/5*15=15x3/5=9 so the water percentage is 19.2+10=29.2 liters and the juice is 9-6.6=2.4 liters. The answer is: 29.2 liters of water and 2.4 liters of juice.",

We now have to mix these 6.67 and 9 liters together. First, let's consider just these two. What is the result if we mix these? To find out, we need to multiply fractions. Take 6.67/(10 liters), and divide by 3/5 = 9/(10 + 9). We get 6.67(10 + 9)/(10 x 9) = 25 / 9 ~= 2.7 liters. We now know that if we mix only these two liquids (6.67, 9 liters), they become 25/9 ~= 2.7 liters of new liquid. The spilled one liter was already counted inside the orange drink, so we still have the entire 10 liters remaining. It was one liter of orange drink, but that one liter mixed into a larger container of 15 liters of pineapple drink. So this 15 is not part of the original 24 liters we asked about. Now we can just add the remaining 10 liters (the spilled 1 liter) of oragne drink to the original 25/9 new liquid and it becomes (25+10)/9 ~= 8.8 liters.

There are therefore 10 liters of water (from the pineapple drink that has 3/5 water). Plus, there is the rest from the remaining part of the orange drink that is left, which would also be 5.67 liters. Therefore, there are 10 + 5.67 = 15.67 liters of water. The answer is: 15.67.",

As per your original request from earlier, adding 19 liters of orangish beverage along with 15 liters worth for another serving makes for an appropriate mix ratio -- assuming that \u2154rd part (i e , 12x) remains untouched -- meaning 12x/(x + y ) == \u2154 .

        " confusing, you know. Let me help you out. Ok, so there was 10 liters of orange drink, which we now know was 2/3 water, or 10 liters x 2/3, which equals 6.7 liters. And there is 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is 3/5 water, or 15 liters x 3/5, which equals 9 liters. So in total there would be 6.7 + 9 = 15.7. Added together. This part was already right! However, you forgot the spilling part, so... I'll show it all here: 10 liters x 2/3 + 15 liters x 3/5 - 1 liter = 6.7 + 9 - 1 = 15.7 liters. Ok, let's move on. You want to mix this with 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. Remember? Now add that in. Oh wait... you added it earlier but without accounting for the lost 1 liter from spillage, so you need to adjust! 15 liters + 14.9 liters (for a grand total of 29.9) times 3/5 = ??? Uh oh. Too complicated! I'm gonna simplify. How about we just take away what 1 liter represents of the original content first, before adding anything else to this mixture (like you did)? 1 liter out of 15 takes up a portion of 10%. 15 - 14.9 = 0.1, which is 10% of the content. What are those percentages worth in volume? Well, if we multiply by the initial amount we'd get 15 x 10%, or 1.5 liters. This means that even though you only lost one more liter from spilling, it actually represented 1.5 liters of content loss because of its percentage relation to the rest of what was poured over! Cool right? So when we start our calculation again, make sure that's what counts towards your new 29.9 total: 6.7+9 - 1.5 = 15.2 instead. Then let's add another 15.",

When you convert to decimals, that simplifies to 2/3 = 3/5 . 2x15=3x10 , where x is the amount in the two liquids. This makes them equal. And x = 25. Now we need to know what that means with regards to the volumes of water. Well, 0.333*25=8.3 and 0.666*25=16.666 . That leaves us with 3.333+15+8.333+16.666=43.333 or 24+43.333=67.333 which is 67 liters because of the one liter that you spilt while doing all of those calculations, and you\u2019ll have about half (15liters) being orange juice mix and almost the other half (32 liters) being pineapple juice mix. You wanted 24 liters though, so this problem actually asks how much water is in the remaining 24 liters. So you would add the original mixture of pineapple with 15 liters of pineapple drink, which comes out to be 47.5liters of pineapple drink. That means that there will be 67-47.5 =22liters of water in the mix you have made, and 67-47.5=24-22=2 liters of the drink you started with. Hopefully that was clear enough to understand.",

Also when mixing you can either simply add the orange mix , but make sure to deduct spilt volume 10 - 1 (spilage volume)=9 , or 10/2* 1/3 *10/100=1 and again mix up together: 13+1=14 (your answer) .",

If the combined amount is known then so is the proportion of each ingredient, then use these to calculate the amount of the overall ingredient (which is your required value in this problem):$$ \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}(15)}{(15+10)}=\\frac{ \\frac{3}{5}(15)}{\\frac{25}{5}}= \\frac{3}{5}$$So $40% $of your solution is water.
