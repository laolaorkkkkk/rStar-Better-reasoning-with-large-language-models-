So he must drive a distance equal to (3 hours) * (60mph) - (2 hours) * (0mph) = 60 - 0 = 60 miles. Next he drives at 30mph for 0.5 hours, which means he covers a distance equal to 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. And finally he drives at 80mph for another 2 hours, covering a distance equal to 2 * 80 = 160 miles. The answer is: 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles from home.",
        " The formula for figuring out how long it takes to travel some distance X (at a constant rate of V) using either simple interest or compound interest respectively can look like one divided by 4 (since 4 is the length/time unit). So dividing both sides of our original formula yields us V divided by X multiplied times Y equals four minus whatever X was initially set equal too(this simplifies as four minus X). Multiplying this last equation together again will allow us find out if there exists an exact solution for all cases involving variable speeds over varying periods of time \u2013 meaning yes there could exist other possible answers too which would also meet conditions mentioned above (including different directions).

        " sum of the distances he needs to cover in the following three time periods (half-hour at 30 mph, rest of 4 hours at 80 mph). It also means he can only take 2 hours to cover all three periods. We are told that it takes John half-an-hour to cover the first distance of 180 mi/h at 30 mph. This means that it would take him 1 hour to complete the entire 180 mi distance. Therefore, we need a 2nd half-hour to complete covering the second distance of the remaining 2 hours - 1 hour. This is what happens during the last two time periods described above. Hence, it took John 2 hours to cover a distance of 180 miles plus a distance of 2 hours - 1 hour = 1 hour - (a distance that equals that 30 mph covered in the 1st half-hour). Thus, John is (2 hours) * 180 miles = 360 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours. The answer is: 360.",

This would mean we need him to travel another distance of 2 * 60 = 120 miles. Since we only spent 2 extra hours driving at 30mph after the traffic incident, we can use this simple formula again. We know our final distance (d) is 180 + 120 = 300 miles away from his starting point, since 180 was the distance initially travelled while driving 60 mph over three hours. Therefore if we also take into account the 2 hours we spent stuck in traffic as well as the 2 hours we drove after the traffic incident at only 30 mph, then you know your final distance is 180 + 120 - 2 x 30 = 200 miles away from home and still requires additional time for him to reach it within four hours.

So over the last 1.5hours of 220minutes, he will have driven 360 minutes (hey we don't need to do the calculation by hand we can use WolframAlpha for such stuff). So he went 360 minutes*30miles per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 180 miles. So the answer is: 180 - 180 - 2 = 158. The answer is: 158.",

Now divide the original distance by 80mph for the return trip and multiply by the amount of time spent driving for a total distance = 80mph*1 hr*60 mins/hour^2 = 360 mi which means his trip will take exactly twice as long but since he drove at least 1 hour before turning around, it cannot be longer than 4 times longer (which would mean 12 hrs). Thus 2x60 min +(4 - 1)*60min=(2.5)*60 min = 375 minutes of driving so the overall duration of a 4 hour trip with standstill traffic could range anywhere from roughly 2 hours, 30 minutes up through four full hours depending upon whether we consider these times include any additional factors such as breaks or bathroom stops along the way. The time taken from beginning until end will be closer toward the middle of those estimates given here though I would expect someone who has driven extensively and knows about such things might give more accurate results; perhaps even better estimates could come via experience alone especially regarding what it feels like once there isn't any visible progress happening during your journey...",

If he drove at 60 mph instead of turning around then he would have moved forward another 180 miles, meaning he lost a distance equal to the difference between this and his actual trip which is 360 \u2013 180 = 180. This means that if all other conditions remained constant he would have been 360 miles from home when he tried to head back. Instead though he turned around right when he realized his mistake meaning that he spent 2 hours stationary which made him loose 120 (60\u00d72) additional miles on top of those already lost! If we add these distances together we see that even if his second attempt went perfectly well then he would still lose another 210 miles since 180+120=300 and 60*3=180 so another 60 mph hour would mean travelling another 180 miles further away from home making the total loss 180+210=390. Now we have information about what happened up until the second 30 minute period, from here we can calculate everything else since it doesn't involve any new variables (such as time spent on each type of movement). Because we know how fast he was going during this second period and how long it lasted we can easily find out how much ground he covered; 30x0.5(30)+30x0.5(80)=45x5=90+45=135 miles which is exactly the same amount that the distance from his original position when he started heading home added together!

This means that this 2 hour trip would cover half as much distance, namely 30 miles. After spending half an hour driving at 30 miles per hour, i.e., covering another 30 miles, he finally continues onwards at 80 mph for the remainder of that 4th hour which is equal to 40 minutes or half of an hour; thus making it possible to add one further 40-mile long stretch onto the trip\u2019s overall length when all said and done!  And since we know the car can go at a top speed of 80 mph (and therefore travels for every minute that passes), it can go twice as fast during its entire duration \u2013 hence meaning both parts have moved 40/120 = 2 miles apart from start to finish!

That leaves about 162 remaining miles from where he started originally. This would make us say that John is 162 miles away from home after traveling for only 4 hours - but because we don't know exactly how long it takes to get somewhere using cars driving along highways and city streets without any roadblocks slowing them down too much (especially when stuck in traffic), we have to use a range rather than an exact number.

From here onward it will be simply calculating ratios until you solve for the final distance. To solve for time John traveled overall consider the legs with 60, and 30 mph combined, this equals 1/60 of the total traveled; then he spent two hours traveling at no speed so this also equaled to 2/80 so in total 1/60 + 2/80 = 7/80, which is a ratio between 7:80. We need a second ratio equal to 152:80 then you can proceed solving. The question asked for the distance covered but since it only mentions speed we still can proceed with ratio. The first ratio that came up from considering how long he was driving at each speed mentioned is 152:80. We know that this ratio is similar to the ratio 1/60, 2/80, 1/30; it means that 60/1, 80/2, 30/1 are similar. Using our first similarity we substitute 30 for 1, 60 for 2 and 152 for 1.

Now I want you take note here that even though there are different segments represented by those three separate parts - namely: 2 hrs spent stuck traffic, 0.5 hour driving 30 MPH & remainder four-hour drive using 80 MPH - but ALL these times were spent travelling away from our starting location which means all distances traveled counted towards positive directional movement hence summed together as total distance covered by us regardless if measured against either ends of any given segment individually!! So simply add up values listed above = $$(2\\times0)+(0.5\\times30)+(4\\times80)=(0+15+320)=335.$$ Distance covered during that particular leg was therefore found out as 335 mi long; however once again remember not every part of pathway traveled along roadways necessarily contributes toward moving farther away from initial starting point especially since one may have taken detours etc...",
        " made at all for these two hours. Once out of that jam it takes him half an hour again doing zero speed (so nothing gained), but finally he reaches his average cruising speed of 80 mph and sustains it through another three non stop hours (total six since leaving home). That makes another $3 \\times 80 = 240 $ miles so overall distance covered after four hrs would be: $(180 + 0 + 0 + 240 ) =$ 600 miles .",
        " driven would be 3*60 or 180 miles.Then he drives 4 hours, so add 4 to 180 for another 180 miles.Adding 180 and 180, his total distance traveled would be 360 miles. The answer is: 360.",
        " home, where he encounters a traffic jam that lasts for 2 hours. While John waits out the traffic jam, it seems he spent about $2$ hours standing still, which can easily be visualized as a horizontal line representing zero progress in terms of distance traveled. The next half-hour is spent driving at a speed of 30mph, which means John has only covered half-an-hour (half of 0.5 hour is $0.25$). This represents an $x$-axis shift of half-a-mile to the right, since if we assume a time increment of 0.5, our speed would be $5.25$, yielding a distance traveled equal to $5.25 \\times 0.5 = 2.625$. Finally, the third leg of his journey (the fourth segment) sees him traveling back home at a speed of 80mph. At this point, you should note that, even though your math may not tell you this, time is actually a dimensionless quantity here; all you have to worry about is the change in position between each segment. So even though it is logical to use $x$- and $y$-coordinates, the fact is that both variables in the following equation refer strictly to positions in space, i.e., points along a road: $$P(t_i)=F(t_f)+D(t_i)$$ Here, $i$ refers to index numbers for each segment (starting from the left), and $(ti, tf)$ indicate pairs of starting/ending points for those segments; these start/end pairs need not reflect actual times at all! Given this, if we label the first three points as $(0,0), (2, -25)$ and $(5,-5)$, respectively, then our equation above would read $F(5)+D(0)=75+(-5)=70$. Hence we see that John ends up 70 miles away from home, just like we expected from reading the story.",
        " if your starting location has coordinates (-3, -2), but ends up at $(1, 3)$ instead of $(10, -2)$, it doesn\u2019t matter where exactly you ended up since the only direction relevant for our purposes would be whether these points represent \u201cahead\u201d movements vs those not counted due to being parallel changes along either axis rather than ones perpendicularly oriented relative another axis! When solving problems involving multiple objects with different origins or directions of motion, think about how far each moves away from its origin point before returning \u2013 not just where they end up! As such considerations impact accuracy during computational tasks like adding vector sums together over time as well). Therefore after his turnaround he heads back toward home base again; let us assume this distance traveled while still stuck in slow-moving highway gridlock equals zero km/h but includes all three stops along route until reaching destination point! Afterwards his journey becomes more dynamic (but perhaps less direct) once speeds exceed 30 kph allowing him eventually reach goal spot without further delay/interruption. Let's say that distance taken up towards final destination increases by one kilometer each time after first pause during travel process so long as there are no other pauses occurring between now through conclusion date shown here under section labeled \"total journey length\" . This means every stop will contribute additional miles towards overall progress until finishing line reached regardless matter how many may transpire en route from start point until final destination reached safely & soundly at last!!! Therefore, total journey time spent commuting back towards home takes four full hours. However since both cars began traveling concurrently yet didn't encounter any major impediments whatsoever during their trip then all mileage accumulated due to travel activity alone should add up accordingly yielding resultant figure representing cumulative totals accumulated throughout said period without subtracting anything unnecessary nor unaccounted for anywhere along route . Therefore our initial calculation becomes $ 3 * 60 + 1 * 30 + 2 * 80 = 500$. Hence we can conclude that the distance traveled by John during the entire time is 500 miles.",
        " which would only be useful information if he were traveling at all. So again ignore this section too as no distance can be calculated for this as mentioned above!! The last two sections will cover time spent travelling at speeds of 30mph for 30 minutes then subsequently spending another full hour driving at 80mph until reaching arrival point; these distances add together due to their relative starting points & ending locations being the same point . So total distance traveled over whole trip=180+0+60+80=320 miles.The answer is: 320.",

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",
        " equals 180 miles. Then he decides to return home but gets stuck in a traffic jam for 2 hours. During the two hour drive, no progress occurs; therefore, it can be said that at this moment John is still at 180 miles away from home, as if time did not pass. It's only after that point, i.e., when he starts moving again, we start tracking progress from that point onward. The next 30 minutes pass while travelling at 30mph, which means another 30 miles have elapsed during these 30 min (remember we already reached 180 miles) . And finally, for the rest of the 4-hour journey he travels at 80 mph covering another 240 miles within those four hours. His starting point was at 180 miles, therefore after 230 more miles travelled his current location would be somewhere around 410 miles approximately. So it can be concluded that John will travel 180+30+240=450 miles before reaching his destination. Therefore, he travels 410 miles from home before coming across anything blocking him from continuing forward and stops because this is how far away he is located currently according what we already know about distances covered/not covered during certain periods or intervals within our story above",
        " back at a speed of 60 mph. This takes $4-3 = 1$ hour, which means he drove at a rate of 60 mph since then to return to home. This yields another 180 miles traveled. Since all units are in the same base and are just being multiplied together, we can simply add them up to obtain our final result: Distance traveled = $180+180 = 360$ miles In conclusion, John has traveled a total of $360$ miles in both directions combined ($180+180$).",
        " journey distance so it is sufficient to know just the distance traveled for this second part of the journey and not all individual segments like \"turn around\" etc. To calculate this we use the same formula used above except this time multiplying by the different speed (30) during the slowest point of the trip instead. This leads us with another value of $2 \\times 30$, which equals 60 as well. Finally we add these two together giving us our required sum equal to **180+60**",
        " the problem by subtracting the original 180 miles from whatever new distance comes in when 3 hours goes into a higher speed. Since we know that the extra 4 hours John spent trying to get back home equals 4 hours total, which includes 2 hours of standstill and one hour with speed at 30mph and finally another hour of traveling at a speed of 80mph, we can solve for this unknown value by solving for distance: (60+30)*1 = (80*1)=distance+180 or distance+180=390 so distance=390-180=210. So John made it 210 miles away home but still did not succeed in reaching it within 4 hours since he has travelled a total of 5 hours instead of the needed 4 hours.",

So if he got 180 miles so far and in addition it took him another hour then he needs to cover a distance of 80+180 which is 260 (you add here the distance he needed to travel at 30mph to the distance he covered until then). He drove for 4 hours at 80mph. Thus distance covered is 80*4 = 320. And in total distance is 180+320 = 500 miles. The answer is: 500.",

Hence sum(distances)=180+(0)+(15)+(900)=1085 (So if it were only miles per hour, he would be driving 180+(0)+15+900=1015 miles, which would put him 150 mi short of home, but since it was mph he needs to travel 1.18 times as far to be accurate. This can be calculated thus: 1015*1.18 or about 1200 mi which is almost the same as 1.2 hours)",
        " extra distance to compensate for the lost 120 miles. Hence, for the net trip distance, John needs to complete a grand total of 300 miles. Now we can apply the rules for combining speeds/distances over different times: Distance (miles) = Speed (mph) x Time (hr). Hence, we can calculate the required trip time: 300 / (30 + 30 + 80) = 6 hr. The answer is: 360 miles",

It doesn't matter if you go at 60 or 30 when trying not-so successfully get home within four more hours though because regardless, all progress stops anyway due to a complete stop over 2 hours prior. With that said..let's see about finding out what it will take for our guy johny-boy here(if this actually is his real name!!)to finally find himself nearer yet closer still to finishing where wanted by taking things one step further along linearly until completing journey? This involves taking into account two variables present here; namely time spent traveling (as per above)and number needed distance travelled which would amount again 180-36=144 Total Miles Needed To Be Overcome Before Reaching Destination Upon Finishing Journey And Returning Home Safely. By putting these two variables together in terms of equations representing them respectively..we get equation",

This leaves us with 180 \u2013 180/1=0 which gives us zero miles left after traveling three hours at 60 mph toward our desired locale. Next question: What is left? John spent another one hour driving through gridlock city traffic at an average rate of about 20 minutes per hour or approximately .2x60 = 12 minutes; however it only took him twenty(~) mins+15=20 min + 15mins=35mins",

        " on those 2 hours for this trip. As such, he is only halfway through the full 4 hour journey and needs another 2 hours for the return trip. During the first half of the return journey he goes at 30 miles per hour for 0.5 hours (half an hour), thus covering 15 miles (distance = rate*time). His total travel so far would therefore be 15 miles, after which he proceeds at 80 miles per hour for the rest of the 2 hour period, meaning he covers another 80 miles, resulting in a total coverage of 15 + 80 = 95 miles. This means John is still about 5 miles away from home. The answer is: 5.",
        " covered, so he only has 60 (the 4 hours of actual travel) / 4 (his rate of progression) = 15 more miles to go! Thus, his remaining distance is 180 miles minus the extra mileage he needs to make up for getting stuck in a jam on the way home:  180 - 120 - 15 = 45 (miles away). The answer is: 45.",
        " reasoning process further until we figure this part out here...now then if this was all we could do before having reached 1120 miles traveled (which would mean that he made it home!) what sorta distance could one expect upon arrival thereafter?? ",
        " hours at a speed of 60mph, his distance would be: 60 * 3 hours. Distance driven = Speed multiplied by Time So, 60 mph * 3 hours. This comes to a total of 180 miles traveled until reaching home. We will call this value d1, or distance traveled the first time driving towards home (d1). Secondly we need to calculate what distance John had to drive again once he realized his oversight about forgetting something back home. As mentioned earlier it took him 3.5 hours so we can write this as 3.5 hours - 3 hours = 0.5 additional hours spent traveling back towards home once realizing his mistake made him waste valuable time which could\u2019ve been better spend elsewhere instead but not anymore!! To do this calculation just multiply our travel speeds again with additional hours worked out previously like so: 60 mph * 0.5 hours = 30 miles. This adds onto original travel from before meaning new total distance from point 1a - B is thus now calculated being: New Total = Original + Additional Mileage 180 miles + 30 miles = 210 miles. Therefore our third equation comes out being: Final Total = Original + Extra + Additional mileage from before 210 miles + 30 miles = 240 miles",

To cover this, he goes at a speed of 80 mph. As he knows that at such speed, he can travel a distance of 80 x 30 / 60 mins = 40 mins per hour or 40 x 2.5 = 100 mins per 2.5 hours. Consequently, he covers a distance of 100 miles while reaching home in that duration of time. The answer is: 100 mins",

Thus ,we can say that at any given point before he finally finished up those pesky 3 hrsof extra work spent finding himself back where he originally started ,John was located somewhere around 50-80 miles (or approximately 60% -100%) away from home .

Next, he spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph before going again at a speed of 80. The next hour will cover another 80 miles and the last half hour will add another 40 miles to this. We can write down all of this to sum the distance traveled in the 4 hours.

        " towards home. But since he realises that he has forgotten something, he gets off his car. And stays off it for 4 hours, which is exactly $2$ hours before the time it takes to travel back. During this period of $2$ hours, no distance is traveled, so the distance covered at the end of 4 hours of him turning around is still 180 miles. Thus he travels 180 miles in the first three hours, and zero distance when stopping for 2 hours, hence he covers 180 miles after 5 hours. To return back home from 180 miles away, he spends the next $30$ minutes in 30mph i.e $1/2$ hr speed, so for this part $d=1/2\\times{30}=15$. Now finally he covers the remaining $3$ hr and $30$ min i.e 3hrs 30minutes at a speed of 80 mph for which the distance covered is $3\\times{80}+30\\times{0}=240$. So the sum of these distances is $180+15+240 = 435$ mi. Now, there is another problem: we need to subtract the distance traveled twice, once in both ways while returning. Therefore the correct value becomes $435-180 = 255$. Hence, at the end of the 4 hours John is $255$ miles away from home.",
        ". When calculating directional difference/displacement over the entire trip it makes no sense to consider movement backwards as if it were \"movement forward\". Thus forwards-only displacement is equal to positive $(+)$ displacement. Similarly, if one travels 3 kilometers to the North and then 2 kilometers Westwards to the original starting location (a square trajectory) the overall directional distance/displacement would be zero $\\text{km}$, despite the fact that one moved along a pathway that travelled both forwards and backwards!  For directional displacements (as opposed to total-trip distances) \"negative displacements\" should not be accounted since their sign indicates movement away from our starting point while positive (+) values signify movement closer towards our starting point! Now I understand why it was necessary to write up my last paragraph and make sure the information was conveyed properly... As always I have tried hard to keep things easy but short enough so readers would comprehend what I'm saying without any major hassle!  In conclusion - all negative displacements are irrelevant unless they add to your total-distance traveled away/beyond your starting point.",
