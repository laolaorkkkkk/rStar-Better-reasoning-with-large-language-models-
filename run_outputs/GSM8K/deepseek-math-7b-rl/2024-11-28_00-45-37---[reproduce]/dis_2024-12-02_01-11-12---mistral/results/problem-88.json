        "'s think step by step. There are two options. Either H is less than M, or it is larger than M. Let's see what will happen if H is less than M. Suppose M = 10 H. Since H is ten times smaller than M, and they added up to 88K, it means that 90 H is also ten times smaller than M. Since 90H equals to 88K, M is 88K/90, that is equal to about 980K. But we know that M is actually only 1 million. It would have been true if H had the same size of M, but it is too small for the answer. We go back one step: H is ten times less than M, thus H is too small. So H cannot be less than M! Now let's assume that H is actually larger than M. Since 88000/H = 11, then M divided by H equals to 10. If we add these two, then 11 times greater means there were 120K copies total! But, we know that the actual number of copies sold was 88,000 because that's what the question tells us. So since this assumption led to an incorrect result, there can't possibly be any solution where H is bigger than M. Let's look at all possible answers again: \u2022 Both H and M were sold. This cannot be true because they sold 88k together but there should have only been 20k or half of that amount, depending upon whether H was higher or lower than M respectively. \u2022 Neither of them was sold. This cannot occur, either because H was purchased when H = 0 which doesn't make sense. So our answer must lie between options b & d.

        " of copies Harald's album sold. By definition, 10 times as many copies are sold of Marilyn's album (Marilyn's sales will have 10 times as many as Harald's). Therefore, 10 Marilyn's albums= Harald's album=> 11 album=(x)=>10(x)=(x) =>(11)(10)=(11)x=>11x=110 11x/11=10 Therefore, we can set the equation up such that 88K =x + (10x)= 11x because 10x represents the amount of Marilyn's sales which 10 times as much as Harald's sales. We will also know that 88,000 represents the number of total albums that were sold altogether. Now, if we solve, 11x = 88,000, we get that x = 8,000. This means that only 8,000 albums were sold of Harald's album. The answer is: 8,000. This is what I thought. You can tell me how it is wrong or correct so I learn from it.",
        " ten times as many copies as him. And together they sold 88000 copies. That means x + 10x = 88000. Solving for x yields x = 7000. Therefore Harald sold 7000 copies. The answer is: 7000.",

        " equation based on what was provided. This equation would look like Sales = Harald + (10 * Marilyns sales). We know that together they sold 88,000 copies, so substituting this value for \"Sales\" gives us the following equation: 88000 = Harald + (10 * Marilyns sales) Next, solve for Harald by dividing both sides by ten to get Harald + 10 * Marilyns sales = 8800 (divide both sides by 10) Finally, subtract Harald from both sides to isolate him and get 9 * Marilynsales = 8700 (subtract Harald from both sides) To find Haralds's individual sale count divide both sides by 9 Since both sides of an equal sign can be divided or multiplied by the same amount without changing their equality ,we may divide 9 across both sides ,to get: 1 * Marilynsales = 966 Then divide both sides by Marilyns to get Harald Sale count . As seen here,harold sale count is approximately equal to 7000.",
        " Since Marilyn's sales were 10 times as many as Harald's, we can write: `m = 10*h` where `m` represents Marilyn's sales. We know that there were a total of `88,000` copies sold. This means that `m + h = 88,000`. Putting together these two equations, we get: `88,000 = m + h = 10*h + h = 11*h`, or `h = (88,000)/11`, which gives us a final value for `h`of `h = 8,000`. Harald sold `8,000` copies.",
