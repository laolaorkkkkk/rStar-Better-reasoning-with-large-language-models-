First, we can define our variables; suppose the price for a pound of wax is 20 (for 10 candles), the cost of wick is 0.70 and our goal is to earn 1500. Using these values in the equation, we can write this as P = c*(a+b). Plugging in our values gives us that 2(400-b+c) = 1500. Solve for b to get 2*(400-b)+c = 1500. Divide both sides by 2 to get b+c-2b=750. Subtracting c from both sides gives b=-(2b+c-750). Solving this gives us b = -375/5 and c = 1375/5.

The cost comes out to be: $(10.00 + 3.00 = $13.00). We want our final product to be: (revenue - cost). (40 - 13) / 20 = 1.35. The answer is: 1.35",

We can conclude that our equation has two solutions: If (S)=(C), then P=0 profit. However, if (S)>>(C) , the P must also be positive. This means that (C)/2<(S) must hold.

        " out how much it costs Charlie to produce these 20 candles. The recipe states that for every pound of wax you get 10 tapered candles, and since one pound of wax costs $10 per pound, it follows that producing 20 of these specific types of candles will cost $10*pounds(2)=$20 dollars worth worth of wax alone before any supplies are even taken into account! So, assuming our friend here only uses one pound for making this quantity worth 20 individual units ($2), his entire supply would amount around ($)$12+20 which happens when 3 things happen simultaneously: He buys 1 lb for a total of $10 dollars 2. Creates enough extra material needed due to loss on transportation (or otherwise) 3. Finally pays off debts like rent/mortgages/insurance etcetera at least according rules set forth about such costs as previously mentioned below within same paragraph (not applicable).",
        " So if he buys one pound (which costs $10), then 10/1 equals ten pounds which would yield 100 candles in total at no extra cost other than purchasing wax alone! This means 20/10 means buying twice as much would result into making half number as many times resulting in 40 candles being made when 2 pounds are purchased. 40 candles sold for $2 each will equal revenue = 40*$2 =$80 but he bought two pounds for $10 which means he spent 80$ total plus 10 from wicks so total cost =$90- $80 = $10 loss",

        " total supply cost was 10.00 + 10.00 = 20.00, so the supply cost per candle is 20.00/20 = 1.00. Therefore, Charlie's net profit for selling all 20 candles is (20*2) - 10*2 = $\\boxed{30}$. Therefore, Charlie's net profit would be $\\boxed{30}$.",
        " in order to produce and sell twenty candles Charlie would need twice as much beeswax. This means he needs 2 lbs * 10 = 20lb total. It costs him 10$ to buy the wax and its wicks (per lb). Therefore our costs are equal to $20 (for the wicks) plus 10 times $10, which is $100. Our formula for his net profit thus becomes 20*2 = 40. Therefore, Charlie\u2019s total expenses are equal to 120$, or simply the sum of its constituent parts: $120 = $100+ $20 = $100+$2x20=20+20 = 120$. Because this is subtracted from his earnings, the result is 80$ which is what he earned. As 20x2 = 40 candles we know that $80 is divided equally amongst these forty items and since a single item sold for $2 apiece, our profits therefore totals 2x40/2 = 80!",

Also, buying only two pounds saves you $2 instead of ten, since you payed twice the amount, you only save half of the original $10 you paid. This is why it has no impact. Therefore, your net profit of $20 remains the same. The answer is: 20."
