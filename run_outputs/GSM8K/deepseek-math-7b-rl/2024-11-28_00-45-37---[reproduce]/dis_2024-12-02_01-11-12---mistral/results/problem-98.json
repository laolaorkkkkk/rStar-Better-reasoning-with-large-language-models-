In the remaining 15 minutes, there would be 25 - (5 + 5) = 15 cars left. These 15 cars go through during the remaining 15 minutes. The average number of cars going through per minute can therefore be calculated by dividing the amount of cars going through by the amount of minutes. So 15 / 15 = 1.

        " 30 - 5 = 25. After the 15 minute traffic jam, 20 additional cars drove through, bringing our number back up to 45. Finally, there were still 40 cars driving through the traffic jam at its start, because we subtracted 5 earlier. The answer is: 40.",
        " the traffic jam. Of those 25 cars, 20 managed to get out before it was over. That means that 5 of them still haven't gotten past the traffic jam when it ends. Since the traffic jam ended after 30 minutes (15+15), if it started at noon, it ended at half past one. 3 hours later is four o clock, so we could say that the cars will only pass that traffic jam if they drove through sometime after noon and before half past three. We can also see that 5 of those 25 cars didn't pass because they exited or were stuck in the backup. Therefore, 25-5=20 went through! Let's say our initial time was actually ten o clock. That would mean all other calculations would change to reflect that fact. So if our initial time was ten o clock, our initial number of cars waiting to go through would be thirty instead of thirty plus however long the traffic jam lasts - which was 3 hours minus the time our simulation starts at. Thirty divided by 5 minutes equals sixty which equals six groups of ten or just one group of fifteen which is exactly what our question asked for! But wait! Don't forget about the second hour of our simulation, which begins at eleven o clock! To account for this hour we can simply subtract twenty-five minus five equals twenty minus five equals twenty minus 5 equals five times ten or fifty less five divided by five equals one hundred and five times five equals one thousand. That makes sense because it's now twenty hours after noon or three AM so if something takes one minute then it will finish sometime around two AM instead so now all you need to do is divide one thousand into 11 o clock then add two AM together - remember that your division is going backwards since the hour hands point at midnight instead of noon like real life hours do - then multiply one thousand by two AM plus one which equals two thousand nine hundred and eighty eight minus seven equals two thousand nine hundred seventy minus one which equals two thousand nine hundred and seventy one minus one hundred and twenty equal one thousand minus one thousand ninety nine which equals ten plus nine plus one is eleven so you've figured out everything correctly!",
        " know that some went though in the first 15 minutes (we just don't know how many). And 20 more cars went through in the last 15 mins. But if all the 20 cars went through in the last 15 mins, then none would go through in the first 15 mins. This means that fewer than 20 went through during the first 15 mins (as there were still 25 cars then). So at least one car went through in the first 15 mins. Therefore, 2 cars went through. The answer is: 2.",
        " traffic jam 30 cars could get through in exactly half an hour, then the question asks what would it have been without anything else being mentioned here. To answer this we see that there was a total gain of 30 - (15 - 15) - (30 / 2 - 5) or just 30 - 15 + 15 + (30 / 2 - 5). This yields a total of 30 - (30 / 2) + 5 which reduces to 30 - 15 + 5 which is a value of 30. Hence our original number was too big since it could only increase once we subtracted the gain caused by everything else happening during the traffic jam, and the new value ends up being 30 minus the sum of these things as previously shown. Since the original value mentioned the cars taking an exit, it seems reasonable that 5 would also represent a reduction in the number of cars driving through in the first 15 minutes. Therefore if our original value was 30 then our new number would be 30 minus 5 thus resulting in 25 cars driving through the jam. However as stated before it might be safer to look at the actual change rather than assume since the wording may not necessarily represent how it truly affected them overall given how 30 car can be seen as having both added something positive while removing something negative from their initial position depending on interpretation meaning if viewed as having removed from their position then 30 - 5 would equal 25 whereas adding something positive would still yield 30 - 5 = 25 but then if viewing it as adding from their position you would likely want to use an additional 5 minus as your solution making it possible to get either 25 or 30 cars going through depending on how these changes were interpreted hence leading back again to why understanding exactly what happened can sometimes help provide more insight into the correct way for determining answers for certain situations such as ones involving traffic jams etc.,",
        " We can also write it down as a formula to make it even easier on ourselves and simplify: (original quantity) + (change from driving/leaving/entering) \u2013 (change from the last event). So in our case (30) + 0 \u2013 ((30 \u2013 5) * .5) = 4. The answer is: 4.",
        " so let's plug those values into a formula; (Number Of Vehicles Now) \u2013 (Number Of Vehicles Earlier) which turns out to be zero minus thirty or negative twenty seven because all changes resulted after time 0 occurred making these numbers opposite direction signs pointing downward instead upward like normal addition/subtraction patterns found commonly when dealing only one number set. Next question asks us exactly what happened so far meaning how did we arrive at this conclusion so if there were ten cars driving through every minute before then we can deduct forty three plus two extra minutes thus ending up at sixty minutes being spent traveling through before finally getting stuck behind everyone else waiting patiently until next turn comes around again later.",

Now we add the remaining 20 cars to \"A\" and subtract \"B\" from that total. (35 - 5) is 30 which matches with our original 30 cars at the beginning and therefore proves that 30 must be the correct answer. The answer is: 30.",

The number of vehicles in the starting row was 30. After 15 minutes of the backup, 20 more cars drove through. So there were 20 new vehicles that didn't need to go in the jam.

This gives us 30 - ( 15+20 ))= ( 15+20 )-5 - 30 Subtracting 5 from the numerator removes the number of cars that took an exit. Next we add the initial number to find the number of cars that passed through the jam. In summary: The answer is: 35.",
        " The 5 cars who didn't go through, therefore, are not in the equation. That leaves only the 15 cars which made it through before the other 20 arrived and the rest drove off. 15 + 20 = 35 is the desired quantity (the number of cars that went through). The answer is: 35.",

Substitute this into the answer expression above to get: 30-(5)=>N=(15+20)-5=(15+15)=30...So, there were originally 30 cars in the line but we subtracted 5 of them as they took an exit before going through. Of these, 25 went on through and we also added 20 more during their 15 minute passage. Since it was only 15 minutes since they passed at least 15 of the cars would have gone through by the time 25 had passed.",
        " having gone through during that first 15 minutes. During this same time period (the first 15 minutes) , only $15$ cars actually passed through . $Thus,(B15C/15)$ cancels out any possible addition due to passing through since neither term involves 15 minutes worth of passing! Finally after another 15 minute window opens up, allowing $20$ more vehicles time pass through they enter from another part of town or come off a different highway etc, but none take any other action except leave at their usual place on foot or bicycle as planned . Thus there were no additional exits taken during this second half hour period and no car count adjustments had to be made again either. Therefore adding just those $20$ new cars onto our 25 previously passing cars gets us totals equal to $(25 + 20)$.",

        " let's first figure out how long the traffic jam lasted. 30 cars + (15 + 20) - 5 = 30 cars + 35 - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45. Therefore, it took the cars 45 minutes. 15 minutes worth 1/4 of 30 cars and 20 minutes worth 1/3 of 30 cars, so 15/4 + 20/3 = 3.75 + 6.67 = 10.42. Since only 5 cars took an exit, it means that 30 cars minus 5 cars equals 25 cars would go through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.",
        " on the information given. We know that there are 30 cars on the motorway before the traffic jam starts, and after 15 minutes, some of those cars have driven through while others have not. After 15 minutes, there are still 20 cars on the motorway and 20 more have driven through the jam in the following 15 minutes. We also know that 5 cars took an exit and did not go through the traffic jam. Let's represent these numbers using variables: B stands for 'before' (i.e., before any cars went through), C stands for 'at completion', D stands for 'during', and E stands for 'exit'. Using this notation, our equation becomes: C= (BD/D) + E We can now solve this equation to find out how many cars drove through during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam. Substituting in the values we know gives us: C=(B15C/15)+D-E=(B1530C/15)+5=(3015C/15)+5=15C/5+1=3+C=30 So, there were 30 cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam. This leaves only 20 cars that needed to drive through during the subsequent 15 minutes, which completes your answer: The answer is: 20.",
        " In addition to this, 15 minutes after the start time, another 20 cars drove past them. They also would not be counted since they didn't go through traffic jams themselves (since 15 minutes was enough for only 5 out 30 vehicles).

        " $25$. First it was 15 divided by the duration of time interval (in minutes), which equals 15 / 15 minutes, which results in 1 car passing through every minute for $15$ minutes straight. This makes a total of $15 \\times 1 = 15$ cars during this first interval. But remember, $5$ cars did take another path (the exit) instead, meaning there weren't actually $15$, rather only $10$ cars from our initial counts that made it through this first portion! Subsequently another event occurred resulting in even more passage; after another set period lasting $15$ minutes we saw $20$ more cars pass over ($20$), again having to adjust down by those same five taking alternative routes (hence leaving behind just a net increase amounting to $5$ total changes). Therefore overall during both these successive phases ($15$ minutes apiece) we ended up having an increase in counts equal to $(15 + 20)$ - ($5$). And since starting values are known as well - namely \"30\" original units - one can simply solve accordingly using substitution rules such as those presented here: $N =(( 15+20 ))\u00e2\u02c6\u20195=30 \u00e2\u2021\u20ac N =30$ And so it turns out according tot his analysis that indeed no less than 15 plus another twenty would've gotten safely across (meaningfully so). Finally when factoring back those additional 5 which never reached their intended destination per se either due either staying put OR moving elsewhere due other choices taken by drivers already present upon arrival time (as discussed earlier) , one arrives finally at a value exactly matching what was originally provided : i.e.. 30 cars driving past without stopping nor exiting via other routes first; hence concluding neatly our little story .",

Therefore we may write an equation for $x$: $(15+x)=25$ since during first section $15$ minutes pass; whereas other half goes on until second $15$ minute interval completes (this implies total elapsed time becomes twice previous figure).
