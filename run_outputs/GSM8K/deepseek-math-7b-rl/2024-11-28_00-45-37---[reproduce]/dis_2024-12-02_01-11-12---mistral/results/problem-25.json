Thus one meal is $12 which adds the total spent on things being $38 and the rest spent was the remaining 12 dollars which can be represented as 12/5=2.4. The reason this is good enough is due to the fact that Marie bought 2 boxes of pizza and spent only $2.4 on those meaning the boxes are all sold at prices under 13 and over 8.5 therefore $8.50 exactly being the amount spent by Marie for 2 of these boxes shows that 2 is the right amount for 12-($15+12+6)=2.
