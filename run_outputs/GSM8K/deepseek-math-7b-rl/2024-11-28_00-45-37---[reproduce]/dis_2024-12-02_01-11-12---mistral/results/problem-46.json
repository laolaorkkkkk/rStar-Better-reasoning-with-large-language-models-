Therefore the equation has taken the form $$x + y - 2\\cdot\\text{cups} = 23.$$ Step 4: Use the fact that she used each Post-It note exactly once to get $$x + y - 2(220) = 23,$$ where $220=\\text{total use}$.

When you purchase packs at Costco or Amazon, each pack comes with 100 pieces...so, this doesn't seem possible (at least not without purchasing more than ten thousand packages in the first place!) So again--what happened? In our setup for the last attempt, we assumed that each purchase resulted in a net increase of P notes--however, we actually only got $B=80+P - (\\text{number of cups})=$note increase each time; this means that instead of saying $B+P = (\\text{cups}+L)$, you need to add the variable $N$, representing the net addition of new packages to the mix, resulting in the updated equation: $$B+(P+N)-(\\text{cups}+L)=0$$ Step 1: Substitute values into variables as usual: $$80+(P+N)-(220+23)=0$$ Step 2: Solve the equation using inverse operations until you reach zero on one side. This is a good idea because it tells us that $0 + 0 = N$. Now we have solved for $N$, allowing us to easily solve for $P$. Adding this value back into the original equation gives us the answer to our question: $$L-(B-N)=\\text{cups}-P$$. Solving this equation is relatively straightforward--as long as you don't fall victim to the same trap we did earlier! Make sure that you substitute in the proper variable on either side. Once again, this yields a nice result. $$\\frac{L}{B}=\\frac{\\text{cups}}{P}=\\frac{23}{80}=0.2875.$$ Therefore: The answer is: 28",

Subtracting $L-80$ would get you where you want to be as long as you added back on another layer for what she ended with overall: $$B+L-80+E=(B+E)+(L-(B+E))=L+U$$ Next we rewrite both the start amount $(B)$, end amount $(E)$ and the end use $(U)$ in terms of $B$, since that is what remains consistent throughout the entire problem. All three variables can be calculated if provided just one number: $$\\underbrace{B+L}_{A=starting\\space amount}+\\underbrace{(L-(B+E))}_{F=end\\space amount}-80+\\underbrace{(B+E)}_{D=number\\space of\\space posts}=220$$ So there are three other quantities we need: Start amount $A$, end number of posts $D$ and number of extra purchases $F$. These three quantities can be found by solving simultaneous equations using substitution or matrix methods: $$\\begin{align*} F&=A-D\\\\ L&=-D \\end{align*}$$ Using substitution (or by inspection), you can see that $$D=\\frac{-57}{2}=-28.5$$ or equivalently, there were $-28$ packages left in the store, so she could only buy $2$.

And at the same time x-5, or the post-it notes from the package that she bought after buying the package itself, means that there were 3 less than x, but 5 more than 80. So x must equal to 88.

Next comes counting each individual cup with its unique identifier printed directly underneath so that customers feel special too ; hence we calculate 23/5x$D$ per unit sold leading towards grand total = ($3D$)\u2217$d$.
