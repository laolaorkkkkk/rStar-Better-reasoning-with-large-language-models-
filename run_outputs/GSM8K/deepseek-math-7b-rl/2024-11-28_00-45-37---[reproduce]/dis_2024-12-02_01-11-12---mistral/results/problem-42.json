We saw that if we start off with 40 apples ,subtract 14 apples away (because these were gone)...well then all together we would get approximately about 26 apples in total which means that's roughly about a quarter of our original 5 apple pies got taken home by the guests at this party ! Pretty interesting stuff isn't it ???",

We can subtract 40 from 14 to get the difference as a negative number, which shows that there were actually less than 14 pieces originally so that after subtraction it would still turn into a positive number (i.e., 40-14=26). Therefore the correct answer is that 26 fewer individual pieces were consumed by guests over time than those initially provided! The correct answer therefore is as follows :",
