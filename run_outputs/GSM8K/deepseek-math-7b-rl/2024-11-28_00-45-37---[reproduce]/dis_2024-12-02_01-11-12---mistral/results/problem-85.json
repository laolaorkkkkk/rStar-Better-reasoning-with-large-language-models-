        " means the maximum amount of years that could ever be included in his quilt is 11. The total number of shirts in the quilt is the same as the number of rows multiplied by the length of a row. Let's start by figuring out the number of rows in Gene's quilt. This number would be equal to the sum of years divided by 4 rounded up. This is because you cannot include a fractional year on the quilt. In other words, we take our number of travel years (11), divide it by 4, and then add 1 back to get the total number of rows (rounding up to an integer). Now we know there are 3 rows and we know each row can have at most 11 squares. Because these numbers only represent years on which a trip was taken there is no way the last row can be filled up entirely with squares due to it representing less than an entire year even if we round up. To account for that loss, we subtract 1 from 11 or 10 to get the true number of squares in the row. Thus we have 11 squares for first row, 10 squares for second row, 9 squares for third row resulting in a total of 30 squares across all 3 rows making the final result 30. The answer is: 30.",
