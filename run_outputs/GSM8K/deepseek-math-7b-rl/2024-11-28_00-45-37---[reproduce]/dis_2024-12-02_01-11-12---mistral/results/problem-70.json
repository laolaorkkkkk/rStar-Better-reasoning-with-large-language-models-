This question is about whether or not you could add the shaded portion back onto the unshaded portion while preserving all the lengths and angles. You could probably make it look better. Here's another thing you could try: since the figure has symmetry, you might notice that it looks like a parallelogram (and indeed, it turns out that it is). The length of one of its sides can easily be calculated by looking at the angles in the top left quadrant of the diagram. It must be equal to $\\theta$ radians, so its length is $\\sin(\\theta)$. From there, you can use the fact that we know the lengths of the other two sides (one is equal to $\\phi$, and the other is equal to $x$) to calculate the unknown dimensions of the parallelogram. If these were inscribed, so there was no space outside the circle, you wouldn't need to use any geometry, just basic trigonometry. I'm not really sure what a 5-fold is, but I guess that if you mean that each angle is $\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{5} = 72^{\\circ}$ , this is definitely possible. In particular, the only way to achieve a $5$-fold symmetry here is through rotational symmetry around the center of the figure (in other words, the line connecting the two intersections would be a diameter of the inscribed circle). If this diagram shows some kind of 5-fold pattern, it's easy to see that one would result from a rotation of 135 degrees around the center point of the diagram. What does this tell us about how large this part of the image should be scaled to produce the correct sized shape? That depends entirely upon your scaling method; if your scaling method is simply based upon counting up from the center to get values at certain locations, then yes, I agree this will work. If instead you somehow divide the whole picture into parts as shown above, I'd say that won't work because this pattern doesn't show anywhere near perfect symmetry when viewed from directly above the figure. The 5 points don't seem to line up along any line through the center either, making it impossible to scale them so that they",

Then $O$ is the intersection of lines $\\overleftrightarrow{AO}$ and $\\overleftrightarrow{CO}$. We know that $OA = OB = OC = OD$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}(OD) = OB = BC$, since $\\overline{OB}$ is parallel to $\\overline{BC}$. Furthermore, $\\overline{BC}$ has length $1$, so its midpoint $C$ must satisfy $OC = 1$. Therefore, $\\triangle OCD$ is similar to $\\triangle OCB$ (since they have $\\angle CBD = \\angle COB$ and share common altitude $\\overline{OB}$) and the fact that $\\overline{BC} || \\overline{OC}$ (since $C$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$).

Therefore, to find the nth root of an expression $\\sqrt[n]{a_1^r_1+a_2^r_2+\\cdots+a_k^r_k}$, it means that we raise each term in the original expression to the $1/n$ power, then simplify if possible: $\\sqrt[n]{a_1^r_1+a_2^r_2+\\cdots+a_k^r_k}=\\sqrt[n]{(a_1^r_1)^{1/n}+(a_2^r_2)^{1/n}+\\cdots+(a_k^r_k)^{1/n}}$.

We could however make use of this fact indirectly through other known exponentiation rules such as those mentioned below in order to prove things like the associativity property for multiplying complex numbers under addition using the fact that exponents commute under multiplication. In particular, when adding two terms with the same exponent, if their coefficients happen to differ in sign from each other then raising them both to their respective powers will result in cancellation; similarly, raising both members separately by $-1$ beforehand produces equal results no matter what the initial values were.
