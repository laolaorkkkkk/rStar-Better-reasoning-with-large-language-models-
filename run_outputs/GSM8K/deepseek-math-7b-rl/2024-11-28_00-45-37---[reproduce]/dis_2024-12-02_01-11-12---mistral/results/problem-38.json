But we only have the information that it is either the second or third day. We do not know which is the first day and which is later. This means this approach cannot work.

In three days, John runs 3 * 60 miles. Since he runs for 3 / 2 hours, the total running time is (3 / 2) * (3 * 60) = 27 hours. Let's see if 27 hours is divisible by any of 30, 45, and 60 minutes. Since 3 * 30 minutes and 3 * 45 minutes are both equal to 27 hours, these two cases happen equally often during the week. If one happens 2 times a week, the other will also happen 2 times a week.

To find out how far he runs on each day, we need to divide this distance evenly between the three days. This means dividing 360 by 3, which gives us 120. 120 divided by 2 is 30.

To make all days together 60, it follows that D1+1/2*D1+1/2*D1=60 This is basically saying that the sum of D1, 1/2*D1 and 1/2*D1 equals 60.  Therefore D1+D1/2+D1/2=60 --> D1=12 D1/2=6 6+6+12=60 So we get that D1=12, which means he ran 12 miles on the first day. If he runs 60 miles per week, we get that D1/6=10. 10 miles per hour is pretty fast for most people.",

Finally, adding all three speeds together gives us John's average running speed over all three days 20+40+0.5*3hours*(60miles/(3hours))=112.5 mph The answer is: John's running speed is 112.5 miles per hour.",

Dividing this by 7 to get the average distance per day results in 600/7 = 85.7 miles a week. Converting this to miles per hour is (85.7 * 3600) / (60 * 12) = 38.64 miles per hour.",

John's running speed is 0.0364 miles per minute or 0.2184 miles per hour. It takes John 0.0364 miles in one minute to run or approximately 21.84 seconds in one mile. The answer is: 0.0364 mph",

Each hour = 60 minutes, so the first day would be running for 3 hours or 180 minutes. For the remaining 2 days, it would each be 1.5 hours or 90 minutes.

Since he runs 60 miles per week on three days, he runs for 60/3 = 20 miles a day. The remaining time on those last two days is (1/2)*(180) = 90 minutes, which converts to one and a half hours.

Since he runs 60 miles each week, we can get an idea of how many miles he runs during each session. Since he runs 60 miles a week, but only three out of seven days, he runs about 20 miles a day. Dividing 20 miles per day by the time spent running each day will tell us how many miles he runs in one hour; since he spends three hours of his week running and then divides this total by a full week of seven days he will run, this would give him three miles for every hour he runs, which works out to three miles per hour.

This means that he covers approximately 103350 feet (or about 20000 yards) in his running time. With the help of this knowledge we can compute his speed: dividing distance by duration yields 103350 feet divided by 4.5 hour which equals 229.222... ft / hr.

This means that John runs for 42 hours in a week, or 42 * 60 minutes = 2520 minutes per week. Finally, we divide 42 * 60 minutes by 1000 seconds to convert to seconds and obtain the answer:  2520 / 1000 = 2.52 hours. The average running speed is about 2.52 miles per hour.",
        " variables: Monday=3 hours, Tuesday/Thursday = 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. Therefore, the sum would be 3 hours + 3 hours + 1.5 hour x 2 = 6.5 hours per week for a total distance of 60 miles. Divide by hours=6.5 to get speed, thus John can run around a speed of 9.25 miles an hour!",
        " 1.5hrsandThursday will match this as well due being labeled both together alongside their respective titles (\"off\") without mentioning either separately since both should receive same attention within equation/response structure hereafter; just using one instance worded differently doesn't change anything regarding mathematical principles behind these calculations so its fine having mentioned it solely once before hand instead doubling up like done earlier). Thus when adding up all three values across course entire week duration\u20143daysx 1.5hoursperday+1hour x 2 = 4 hours total running time per week, which means John runs at roughly 15milesanhourrateorroughly 1milesincredibly13minutes\u2014a fairly efficient pace given context surrounding distance covered within short span between startandendofrunactivity(i.e.,therewon'tbedozenstopsalongwaywhereuphillslowsdownprogressesignificantly).",
