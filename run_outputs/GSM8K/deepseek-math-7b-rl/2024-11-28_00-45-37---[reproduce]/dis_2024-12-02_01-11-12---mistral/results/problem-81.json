Moving forward, it is helpful to think about when these items start to appear/disappear (in this case, he received $23$ additional ones when someone else wished him luck via some sweet stickers). Let's see what happens if we add $23$ more onto the initial amount of $\\boxed{35}$.

As a result of going through this thought exercise involving mathematical equations and conceptual knowledge about various ways of acquiring objects over time, we conclude that by adding up everything involved including buying goods at shops during regular hours ($21$) , having someone special send well wishes upon birthdays ($23$) , receiving presents throughout life\u2019s ups & downs , giving away stuff voluntarily etc., plus any other transactions related specifically towards these types of occasions \u2013 leads us safely into calculating out exactly why exactly now you possess \\boxed{35}+21+23+9+28=\\boxed{58} stickers instead!",
