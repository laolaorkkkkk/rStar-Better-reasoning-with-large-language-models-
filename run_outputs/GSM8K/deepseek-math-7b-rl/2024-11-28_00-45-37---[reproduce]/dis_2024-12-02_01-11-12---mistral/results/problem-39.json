That means she moves forward three miles in one hour while running. Two-thirds of the time, she walks; that means she will spend two hours walking. Two-thirds of the time, she walks; that means she will spend three miles in two hours while walking. Thus, in six hours she will move six miles while running, and six miles while walking. Therefore, in all, Dana will move 18 miles during the 6 hours: three miles in one hour spent running, six miles in two hours walking, and eight miles in three hours running, plus three more miles in those same three hours from walking, which equals 18 miles. The answer is: 18.",
        " instead! When walking, meanwhile, because it takes twice as long as skipping does (one hour of walking is equal to three hours of skipping), we can figure out that it takes about half an hour just for one mile traveled! So given these facts, let's do our calculations! If dana spends 1/3rd (or one third) of her time running then we know it would take 3 x 1/3rd which equals 1 hour spent during all times combined doing both activities combined together at once while running during one hour outta three total hours used up doing said activity altogether before switching back over into walking mode afterward another half hour later...and finally completing our task off course successfully enough having reached out destination safely & soundly arriving right now !

Adding those together gives **3 miles covered over the entire period.**",

So when she is running, she moves a distance equal to 1/3 \u00d7 (18 / 4) = 3 miles per hour, which makes 3 mph \u00d7 (2 h) = 6 miles. Finally, because she walks at half the rate of running, she moves a distance equal to 1/4 \u00d7 6 = 1.5 miles over the same period. Adding up all these distances, we get 18 + 6 + 1.5 = 25.5 miles, which answers the question. The answer is: 25.5.",

Because she skips at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she runs, her walking speed will also be half that rate or half the original rate of running (4) times \u00bd or 2. Therefore 3 skipping speed divided by 12 running speed equals the ratio \u2153 time spent running, \u2154 time spent walking.

Finally, her rate of walking must also multiply according to these proportions: 4*3/3=4 times as fast when running and 1/4th the original value when walking.

Finally when she walks it will take her twice as long to cover the same distance that took one third of that time to cover while running which means it takes double that amount of time (as we found out previously) which works out as being 4/3 times slower making its own pace equal around ~1/3 (one third) speed relative compared with the rest (the former two values). Thus overall if she spends one-third of six hours running during those periods then four hours would pass by before finally stopping altogether meaning there remains another two whole hours left over remaining until completion time thus enabling us now determine what amount exactly amount these last two portions contribute towards total length travelled across all said intervals combined together :",

Therefore, if she walks for 6 out of the 6 hours, then the entire trip should last 6 x 6 = 36 miles (6 hrs * 6 mph). Additionally, during those 6 hours she was still moving, so she ran for the remaining one-third time of 6 hours = 2 hours. During this 2 hr period, she traveled a distance of 12 mph * 2 hr, which equates to 24 miles, so for the whole trip she traveled 36 + 24 = 60 miles!",

If we do some basic math here it would look like 6 * (12 / 36) = 4 miles. When walking, Dana gets halfway as fast which means we need to divide our previous result by 2. This leaves us with 4 mi + (4mi \u00f7 2) = 4 + 2 = 6 miles per hour for a total distance of 6 hours travelled.

That said we needn't really worry ourselves too greatly over potential complications resulting from interpreting these proportions figuratively speaking because ultimately it doesn't matter whether or not someone actually goes through such motions literally because regardless as long as these conditions hold true (i.e., 12mph is representative of max achievable velocity attainable while performing activity considered \u201crunning\u201dwithin context question posed earlier) then any resultant calculations carried out would lead unambiguously unto final answer sought being attained successfully.",

The question asks for the total distance travelled over the course of six hours, assuming Dana spent one third (i.e., 2) hours running, two thirds (i.e., 4) hours walking. Thus we must consider how far she travels each minute while running versus walking. During her 2 hours spent running, she travelled 60 * 2 = 120 minutes, during which she covered a total of 120 * 12 = 1440 miles because her running speed was 12 mph. During her remaining 4 hours spent walking, she covered 4 * 60 = 240 minutes (or 4 hours), meaning she travelled 240 * 6 = 1440 miles total over those four hours.

This way if there were another way for our heroine who wishes not only stay active but move around freely throughout various parts of our world without becoming exhausted quickly. I suppose having these two extra modes available may seem strange initially - however upon further thought, it turns out quite useful once realized.

        " = 12 mph. She also walks at a slower speed of just half as fast as when running. This means that she walks at (1/2) of 12 mph = 6 mph. Since this question involves skipping, running, and walking all in a single day, we need to look at those rates together so we may compare them relative to the amount of time spent doing each activity. We know that she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking. We also know that she skips at 3 mph throughout the whole period that she's exercising -- which takes up three out of six hours because of that one third/two-thirds split with respect to how long she spends running vs walking versus skipping (since skipping is what occupies all six hours). Thus: 3 / 6 = 1 / 2. One half of six hours equals three hours; this means when Dana isn't skipping she spends twice as long either running or walking as compared to if she was exclusively exercising via skipping alone. Let us now consider these ratios individually instead of collectively: when running, Dana moves along at 12 miles per hour; during the same stretch that would take up 1/2 of her time (and therefore it amounts to running for 6 hours straight), she travels 12 x 6 = 72 total miles (since this assumes she doesn't slow down over those six consecutive hours). When walking however, things get tricky because there isn't any direct ratio between walking speed and time spent performing this action relative to running speeds -- instead we'll need to estimate based upon what we know about average human physiology under normal circumstances assuming that a healthy individual who practices both activities regularly would maintain consistent levels regardless... So let's say that although walking occurs more slowly than sprinting (as measured by distance travelled over fixed periods like above), nevertheless most individuals capable of engaging both types would experience something close enough such that their maximum output can be approximated through multiplication rather than simple addition (e g., 10 miles per hour walked would roughly equal 24 miles per hour run). If this were true (or at least reasonably so), then 12 x 6 / 24 yields 18 total miles covered during our given scenario involving mixed use -- meaning Dana could hypothetically travel across about",
        " a walk she goes 4 mph/2= 2 mph. Because Dana is travelling in 6 hour, so we can calculate how much distance she can cover. While she spend 1/3 of the time running, (2+4)/3*3 mph * 1 h = 8miles, And while spend 2/3 of the time walking(2+4)/3*2 mph * 4 h = 16 miles. Therefore, the answer is 24miles.",
        " using only a quarter of what it normally takes because when going at her walking speed, she would move ahead at half the normal rate due to slowing down and eventually come to a complete stop (even if it took less time than what would normally happen). This also tells us exactly how far away one mile becomes when travelling along roads which require constant movement rather than turning around every block or street corner like most people would have been accustomed too back then before cars came onto scenes. But why stop here though ? Let's take things up another notch further and consider an even wilder example : suppose someone wants to drive from city A all the way to destination B which lies directly opposite them on map , say across whole USA . That's 3953 miles ! That means that their journey would take around sixty hours straight . This makes sense since going backwards takes longer than moving sideways ; so there wouldn\u2019t be much point stopping anywhere along way especially since there aren't many rest stops either side roads ! And finally let's look at another situation : imagine someone driving down freeway doing 60mph while other lane full speed limit being 50mph ; what happens? The person behind him starts getting frustrated waiting behind slower vehicle . Finally after hours spent idling around same spot without seeing anyone else nearby he/she gives up trying speed up traffic flow himself/herself by simply merging into fast lane . Although this may seem very logical thing do when dealing w/ congestion problems however it also comes with certain disadvantages e.g : having poor visibility from inside car especially front window where sun blinding glare off screen tends block view . Not mention having higher chances collide w/ other vehicles due careless driving behaviors such text messages distraction while operating machinery etcetera.....

To complete one mile takes 60 minutes (or 60 seconds), so to go four miles would take 60 minutes divided by 4 due to dividing both sides by this value, leaving us with 15 minutes for each one mile travelled! As we know that Dana plans on spending one third of her time running and two thirds of her time walking, then taking into account both methods combined we calculate what portion they comprise together \u2013 one third plus two thirds equals one whole unit; therefore she has travelled four miles over six hours if she split up running into thirds (which equates to about twenty minutes) and walking into halves of those portions respectively (one-half plus another-half equal one whole unit again). Therefore our answer would be four minus the time spent doing either method alone \u2013 hence why I said earlier that it takes twenty minutes per mile when skipping or running respectively\u2026 So let\u2019s say we assume each person spends twenty minutes moving around on foot instead: then subtract them out from those numbers calculated previously \u2013 giving us 2 hrs and 30 mins remaining after factoring both activities into consideration !!!",

To do this, we take her run speed of four times the speed of skipping (four times three) and multiply it by the amount of time spent running (two hours). This gives us a distance of twelve miles traveled during the two hours of running. Now, we need to calculate the amount of time she spent walking (i.e., not skipping or running). Since we know she skipped for one third of the time in six hours (three hours), we can subtract this from six to get three additional hours of walking. To find out how much she walked over those three hours, we take the speed with which she walks (half the speed of running, or two times faster than skipping) and multiple it by the duration (three hours): six miles total distance travelled during these three hours of walking. Lastly, adding up all distances traveled yields twenty eight miles; twenty four were traveled by running and skipping together over two hours plus another four from walking alone over one hour.

In other words, it takes her one hour to cover 1 mile distance while she is running and another two hours to cover 3 miles distance while she is walking. Therefore, she would complete a total of 12 miles in 6 hours. The answer is: 12.",

For running, we use equation Distance = Speed * Time where d = 12 mph and t = 1/3 hours => distance = 12* 1/3 = 4 miles per hour for skipping we use same equation again (Dana skips at 3 mph);  so now distance = 3 * 1/3 = 1 mile per hour finally Dana spends the rest of her time (the remaining 2/3) walking, so let\u2019s solve that case too using same formula.

This means that during an hour when she is running, she moves forward for a total distance of seven miles. Similarly, when she walks for a full hour, she covers a distance of only one mile because it is half as fast as her running rate. We can determine her speed while walking by dividing the amount she covers in one mile by the amount of time it takes her to cover the distance - in this case, one hour. Thus, walking one mile takes one hour, meaning her walking speed equals one mile per hour. Finally, we are told that she will spend one-third of her time running, which corresponds to three out of six hours. This means that she runs for three hours and walks for another three hours. To calculate the total distance she traveled during all of these activities combined, we add up all the distances travelled during each activity - so first add together how far she ran (7 miles), then how far she walked (3 miles) and finally how far she skipped (18 miles).

Therefore, the fraction of the day spent walking must also be less than \u2154 (since the fraction of it spent skipping is more than \u2153). Hence, the amount of time that can be devoted to running is slightly greater than that used for walking in a single day; this means that Dana could spend roughly equal portions running vs walking within that day. We could even estimate that about half of each day was spent doing either activity\u2014which would mean an even split in mileage achieved by them! Lastly note that even if some running/walking periods were shorter or longer than others during those 6 hrs span period--it doesn\u2019t matter because all calculations remain valid regardless anyway\u2026..(for example 4+hours=16miles & 1.5hour=8miles respectively) .

        " If she spends one third of the time running and two-thirds walking (in the amount of time equal to six hours), then she ran for one-third as long as walked, which is [(one-third) / 6] hours, i.e., 2 hours (because six divided by three equals two). During those two hours that she was running, she covered 12 miles in 2 hours according to the information provided earlier. Therefore 24 miles would be covered over all 6 hours since 24 equals 12 times 2 = time spent running over entire duration times distance traveled while running every hour (since Dana walks slower than she runs, so we must first subtract this difference before getting final result). Finally adding distances walked together results in 28 miles, which answers the problem correctly.

Over those 2 hours of running we have [(24 divided by 2) / (6 minus 2)] hours remaining, i.e., 6 additional hours in which dana walks instead; consequently when walking at a rate of 3 miles per hour each day this totals up to 18 extra miles accumulated over all 6 days due to increased activity associated with this mode form locomotion being employed more frequently throughout course of period covered here.",

When she walks, her speed will be half of her running speed, so she will go one mile in half of three hours, that is one mile every hour and a half. In total, if we add the times together it will make four and a half hours, because 1/3 plus 1/3 and 2/3 makes 1 and 1/3 (4/12) plus 1 (6/12) plus 2/3 (8/12) making 4 and a half hours (4 and 1/12).

At six miles per hour (twice the skipspeed of 3 mph), she could have gone 6 miles in an hour, so over six hours she would go 6 miles times 6/6 = 6 miles (twice the original).

Because we are given times for each type of motion rather than distances or speeds, we need something proportional to compare them to get an idea of her speed while walking/running/skipping over different distances... One way you could approach this problem would be calculating what fraction of one hour's worth of effort would yield equivalent results using both sets (of fractions). If skipped for one third (1/3), ran one fifth(or 1/5) , or walked two thirds (2/3) , you can determine their equivalent fractions respectively through multiplication--for example; by multiplying by 3/5 they become 9 \u00f7 5 \u21d2 9 / 5 \u21d2 9:5 . This means she runs 9 units while walking takes up 5 units each time . With that said though keep in mind we still only have hours available so we need an equation here somewhere which includes distance AND time spent doing activities. To find a relationship between them use formulas; if $v=d\\cdot t$, where v stands velocity then dividing d and t would result in 9/18=t and v=d\u22155 . As seen above the velocity changes depending on how fast something moves compared with another object moving at constant speed , so in other words distance travelled over time taken; however these same principles apply no matter whether it's running, skipping ,or walking because distance traveled doesn't really care about speeds\u2014just lengths traveled .",

Substituting appropriate variables yields $\\left(distance\\right)=$$\\left(\\frac{6\\times6}{\\mathrm{1}}+\\frac{2\\times6}{\\mathrm{3}}\\right)=\\left(18+12\\right)$ which rounds neatly down to 30 miles traveled over that period - great work everyone!!

Well From Our Earlier ObservationsWe Have Discovered The Following : His Skipping Speed Is Equal Three Times The Pace At Which He Runs And The Rate At Which He Travels When Just Walking Is Half The Average Rate At Which He Skips Or Raises His Feet But Not Necessarily By Any Significant Amount - Meaning The Amount Of Progress Made Will Depend Upon The Amount Of Energy He Applies Towards This Activity Because Even Though Its All Done Slowly Enough To Allow Some Form Of Relaxation During Each Step , Its Still Very Taxing Work .That Said ; Let's Get Started !!! If Our Friend Had Two Different Types Of Transport To Choose From(One Being Faster Than The Other ) Which Way Would They Travel ? Well If Your Are Wondering About The ",
        " Of Herself Which Means:$\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot{S_{walk}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot(4*6)=4*6=24$ MPH (Assuming She Has Some Rest/Recovery Time). Now Let's Calculate How Many Miles Dana Will Travel In Six Hours If She Spends One-Third Of The Time Running And Two-Thirds Of The Time Walking.:$T_{walk}=\\frac{18}{24}=1hr, T_R=3Hr.$ So Total Traveled = Walking+Running ,where walking equals $W\\times{\\Delta_H}$. Thus $W=\\frac{(S_{walk})\\times{1hour}}{24mph}=\\frac{(24mph)\\times{(1hour)}}{24mph}=1miles$. Total Traveled = Walking+Running ,where walking equals $W\\times{\\Delta_H}$. Thus $W=\\frac{(S_{walk})\\times{1hour}}{24mph}=\\frac{(24mph)\\times{(1hour)}}{24mph}=1mile$. Total travel traveled in six hours would be: $T_total=(S_{run})+(S_{walk})$ which becomes: $T_total=[(3+1)\\times{6hr}]=[4\\times{6hr}]=[24]\\cdot{}[1]\\cdot{}[1]=24miles$. So Our ",
        " 2 Miles during those same 2 hrs .it means dana covers only 1 out 3rd distance covered (that is 2 miles)while remaining other two thirds distances were covered during walking alone which implies running speed equals twice walking speeds . Hence Running Speed = Walking Speed x 2 ;or equivalently walking speed = running speed / 2. So given dana runs @ 6 mph = 2(walking speed ) =>dana could also walk at a constant speed for three consecutive days consecutively covering an average speed off 1 mile per hour in every 2 hours without any variation ! Thus ",
        ". That means we need to take 3 / 2 to get her running speed. Running is four times faster so we multiply 2 (the value we got by taking 3 / 2) by 4 and get 8. So her running speed is 8 miles per hour. So let's get back to the question. Dana is going to spend 1/3 of the time traveling at the rate of 8 mph, 2/3 of the time traveling at 3 mph, and no time traveling at all. In other words, for every three hours spent, one hour was spent running, two hours were spent skipping, and no hours were spent actually not moving. This means that in six hours, Dana would have traveled three miles (because one mile was run), or six miles when skipping since they only took place during the two hours, or zero when not moving. Dana would therefore travel at most six miles in six hours, but this could change depending on what combination of distances traveled she chose within that six-hour window. Let's see what happens if you choose something really close to even ratios: for instance, imagine that Dana walked for 4 hours straight before spending two hours running and then another two hours walking again \u2013 which sounds like pretty slow progress! With these assumptions, our equation becomes 4x+2(8)+2(3)=6h; solving yields x\u22480.65. As such, Dana would probably spend less time walking slowly than running quickly and would travel about 3 miles using this method \u2013 although of course she could still choose any combination between the two extremes instead. The answer is approximately 0.65.",
        " distance covered during skips would also account towards another factor being greater than oneself by which ratio does the corresponding amount apply based off this observation - this means we have our initial equation: $$\\frac{T_{walk}}{T_{skip}} = \\frac{\\dfrac{d_{walk}}{v_{run}}}{\\dfrac{d_{skip}}{v_{skip}}} = \\frac{t_{walk}}{t_{skip}} = \\frac{3}{6}$$, where ${T_{walk}}$, ${T_{skip}}$ represent the respective time spent walking/skipping while ${d_{walk}}, {d_{skip}}$ stand for their distances covered using those respective speeds ($v_{run}$, $v_{skip}$). Therefore, we now have an idea of how far one might go given these conditions - let's look into calculating precisely what distance should correspond then by taking all factors related together under consideration - namely taking note here that Dana uses one-third the time running while spending two-thirds doing other activities (such as walking), meaning $\\frac{1}{3}(6h)=180min=3h$ during which activity occurs before switching back again after $2*3=6$ hours pass by when switching over once more afterwards etc. This results in $$\\frac{T_{run}\\times v_{run}+T_{walk}\\times v_{walk}+T_{skip}\\times v_{skip}}{total} = d$$ , which simplifies further down due mostly because each term remains constant since $3h+6h+180min/4=90min=$54 miles. Therefore, Dana could theoretically cover ~19 miles ($54 miles/$3 hours) within her given range using such methods alone! This concludes our discussion about solving these equations accurately without much additional effort needed otherwise - hopefully providing you with some insight as well about what might happen otherwise based solely upon input provided earlier in order better understand why certain situations arise within them.",
        "mph , She Can Run @ 6mph ! Also since Dana's Walking Speed equals Four Times Less Than Her Running Speed ; She Should Spend One Third Of All Time Doing Walking Instead Of Running ,And Therefore Total Traveled Distances Will Be A Multiple Of Seven While Combining Both Modes : $T_walk=6h*4T_run=6h*6T_skip=6h*3=$",
        " work out this problem in order find out how far someone could get in a specific amount of time (such as 6 hrs) . For example 3hr=6 miles . That means 6 hrs = 6 miles \u00f7 3 hr or 18 miles. She can skip for 3 hours which means $3h=3miles$. She can walk for the other three hours and she walks 3 mph. Therefore $3h=3miles$. So for every 1 mile, it takes 1 hour. Let's say she'll walk 6 miles in the span of six hours. This means there were 12 hours dedicated solely toward moving forward at speed 4mph instead of slower speeds like skips and walks combined with time spent doing those activities (i.e., during their respective segments). To calculate exactly how far our person would progress given these conditions use an equation: distance=rate*(time). We get this value here because during this stretch, our protagonist goes from start to finish at speed 3mi/h while also spending half way time moving with speeds less than 3mi/hr such as skipping which equals three units per unit (or minute) then back down again",
        " speed will be 3 * 2 = 6. 6 is 4 times faster than walking at the rate of 3. Let's take 3/4 and multiply by 3, to get the time spent running which is 3/4 * 3 = 1.5 h. Then multiply 3/4 by the number of hours in a day, 24, which gives us 24 * 3 / 4 = 18 hours. We divide it by 2 to find walking time which is 18 / 2 = 9 hours. Add these numbers to get 18 + 9 = 27, and this represents the total amount of time in which she skips. Finally we multiply this amount of time by her skipping speed of 3 miles per hour, which is 27 * 3 = 81 miles. The answer is: 81 miles.",
        " skips at 3 miles per hour for one third of the time, she runs for two thirds of the time and this equates to 6 divided by 2 equals 3 miles per hour. Also since it took her three hours to cover 3 miles while walking, we can assume her walking speed is equal to the inverse of 3, which is .3 or .3 mph. We use this walking speed to help us solve for how far she travels in six hours. If she walked at .3 mph for three hours, she would have walked only 3*.3 equals 0.9 miles. We divide our 0.9 distance traveled while walking by .3 mph to yield 3 hours. From here we subtract the previous value of 3 hours spent running. Therefore she spent 3+3 equals 6 hours total running, so our equation is equal to 2/3*(6)+6 which yields 10. The answer is: 10.",
        " walks, then her walking pace would be 3/4 of her running pace, so 3/4*6=4.5mph. So in six hours, she could have skipped for 3x6=18 miles and ran/walked for (1/3)*6=2 miles. (In total), 18+2=20 miles. The answer is: 20.",

One third of the time spent running is 360 / 3=120 minutes, so she ran at 6 mph for 120 minutes or 6 * 120=720 miles. Two thirds of the time walked is 360 / 2=180 minutes, so she walked at 1.5 mph for 180 minutes or 1.5 * 180=270 miles. Therefore, her total traveled distance is 2160-720-270=1170 miles. The answer is: 1170.",
        " by 3 which equals 2! Then let\u2019s go to the fraction bar so we divide and get an extra two. So 2 plus 2, so this means she is going to spend 4 hours running. And here we can find what it\u2019s like for her to be running 4 times faster. To find out that is, since Dana can run at 4 times faster than she can walk, then let\u2019s take 4 and multiply by 3 miles per hour, which gets us to 12. That\u2019s how fast she\u2019ll run when compared with her normal walking pace, so she runs at 12 miles per hour! Now let\u2019s go back to the question about how far she could skip at three miles per hour. I want you to picture running vs. skipping. We already said skipping was half as fast and she skips at three miles per hour\u2026that\u2019s great, except we know something else\u2026we also know her skipping distance (it's equal to her walking distance) is half as far again. So that means that we need to halve her skipping distance again and get one-fourth as far. Since she could skip four hours, that\u2019s like running for 4 / 3 hours, or three hours. Three times three miles per hour is nine miles!",
        "=4hrs spent walking. Let\u2019s call this time T so we know where we are going to plug it in later\u2026.and our goal is to figure out how fast Dana runs and how far she can go! Here is what I would write on paper, since the textbook asks me to think step-by-step: Time is 6, 2 and 4 hrs running walking and skipping. Since Dana can run four times as fast as she walks. We multiply the numbers of hours by four (because it takes four times as long to run). Running : 2 hours (times) 4 and equals 8 hrs walked: 4 hours (times) 1 because she can run 4 times as fast and you want to walk so no change to time so it stays 4 hr skipping: 2 hours, (times) 1/2 or half which is 1 hr! So now we know the actual time it took to complete these activities...now we need to figure out how far she travelled during the time. So since distance traveled is equal to rate times time and time is given. We just need to figure out the correct rate in terms of miles per hour because we already know the times for each event. The easiest way to figure out the rate of speed for each activity is by using multiplication or division. When something is faster then the other thing. You divide by the thing that is slower because that gives you the fraction that compares the two things (one part being bigger) when looking at a ratio between two things.",
        " run we know this means she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. To help us put this into context, we can break down how much time she will spend doing each task in that 6 hr period. Running for those 2 hrs...we can multiply our mph of 6 by the amount of time (2) we get 6 x 2 = 12 miles during which she was running. For skipping she can travel 3 miles in 1hr so during the hour and a half...3x2 = 6 miles total and 2x3 = 6 miles during the other two and a half hours. Finally we add these things together, 12+6+6 = 24 miles is the distance she traveled! Now we just need to know the overall time to find it is spent. We know 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/6 or 1/2, so we know the fraction of time during this period she will skip. Therefore the answer is...24 miles in 1/2 of the 6 hours which gives us 12 hrs.",
        " 2=6$ miles per hour. That means running at her maximum speed, she would complete the race in 6/6 =1 hours. This means that she could skip for (2/3) of the time, which is 2 hours. Walking at her rate of $3\\times 1/2$ would take a whole hour, leaving no time for running. To get it again, divide 6 / 3 = 2.",
        " we have to divide 6 hours by three\u2026one third of 6 hours is 6/3 which equals two hours of running. So, she runs for two hours. Now, she says she\u2019ll run the rest of her time, two thirds of the time. We can do this in two ways. Either she\u2019s saying that the other 4 hours in our example are spent walking or she means four sixths of the time. I think it\u2019s clearer to deal with it in 6 hour chunks\u2026that way we don\u2019t need fractional quantities. To get two thirds of something you just have to multiply by two thirds. Two divided by three is not equal to four thirds (we would instead use two over three or 2/3). So she runs for two hours and walks for four hours. The problem tells us that she can walk at one half the speed she runs. This means she walks about two hours times two thirds (1 mile per minute) divided by four (two hours plus two hours), which will come out to 2 miles walked. She ran about two hours, times three miles an hour, so eight miles run. So all in all she ran 8 miles and walked 2.",
        " and divide 6/2 which equals 3 hrs spent walking...great! So we know the amount of time she runs vs the amount of time she walks. Now we just need to calculate how fast she runs and how fast she walks. The question also tells us how fast she can run, so let\u2019s try and use that to our advantage by figuring out what it would take for her to walk that distance instead of run it...let me show you how I\u2019m going to work this problem using your values\u2026so Dana ran it for 2 hrs at a pace 4x as fast as the normal walking speed..let\u2019s call it 4 w. To run that distance in the remaining 4 hrs she could go 4 times slower at a walking pace equal to speed of 1/4 w (if Dana runs at a pace 4x as fast then to reverse that and go the same distance at a pace 4X slower we would need a pace 1/4 x slower...you get the idea)...and lastly she skips at a speed equal to 1/2 of the running speed. Using those values lets look for the total distance travelled. To start the running portion we run it at a speed equal to 4w...to run that distance the question asked for 3 miles in an hour, well the same way I said about 4ws we would need to move back half a stop and instead say the distance was travelled in 1 hr at that time, which would be at a speed of 2w. The walking portion will be a similar calculation but slower, it\u2019s only 1w and the slowest part (the fastest part being skipping) is when moving at the original w pace which results in 6 miles an hour. Now we know how much distance Dana travels by using different speeds but what the real question is asking is how far did she really run over those six hours?! Well first we start by finding out how much total distance she traveled in six hours, to do that we multiply three numbers together 2w * 1w * 1h...that comes out to be 2 miles. Then next we subtract the skipping portion 1/4w 4x4=1w. Lastly we add up the difference 1w and the running speed for a sum of 3w...and again we multiply these products together 3w",
        " skipping is half as fast as running, her running rate must be 6 miles per hour. 2 hours running times 6 miles/hour equals 12 miles she covers when she runs. And we know that she spends 4hrs skipping. so that means we multiply 3 mph by 4hrs for a distance covered of 12 miles also...now just add the two distances together 12+12 and you get the answer...24 miles!",
        " skipping she would get twice as far. So skipping at 3 mph, she would go 6 miles total. While running, it might help to use the fact that Dana can run four times faster so while running at 6mph she would go 4 times farther or 24 miles total. The question is asking about the total amount of miles she traveled while running and walking\u2026..since she ran 24 miles and walked 6 miles the total miles is 24+6=30 total miles. The answer is: 30.",
        "'s going to be skipping, and also it says this is a percent breakdown of the time spent doing it. So what we know is that she's spending, I guess you could say almost half that time running because one-third is 30% and 2/3 would be 60%, so if you add them together, that's 90%. The only thing is that, because we know these speeds, if we solve it backwards we can see that if she runs for a quarter of the total time, she is actually running more miles than when she walks. Now, it was mentioned earlier that she is able to run 4 times as fast as she walks, and also that she can skip about half as fast as she can run. So what this means is if Dana ran three blocks, that's the same distance as her walking one block. And also, if she skips one block, then her running three is equal to the distance that she would go when she walked.",
        " her time running and two thirds of her time walking. So we know it takes four hours to run and two hours to walk. She says one third of four hours equals two hours and two thirds of four hours equals three hours so the question asked us how many miles she traveled when she spent two hours running, and then one hour running. So 2 hours x 4 times faster than 1 hour is eight hours. And the 1 hour skipping is 3 miles per hour which is 3 miles in 1 hour or 4 miles in 1 hour. When you look at these in fractions it was 4 miles in 4 hours plus 3 miles in 2 hours, since we said it would take Dana 2 hours to run one mile. Or we could say it was 4/4 plus 1 1/2 so 1.5 plus 1 is 2.5 so Dana ran seven and a half miles in the two hours it took her to run and skipped six miles in two hours and we know running is 3x as fast as skipping. So 6 miles divided by three equals two. So Dana ran nine and a half miles.",

Let\u2019s go back to where we were before...since we know the proportion of time she was running we can calculate the actual amount of time and the distance she ran during that time. We know Dana runs at a rate of speed four times faster than she walks meaning that she runs at 4 times whatever the walk speed is...so\u2026she can walk at 2 miles per hour...this means\u2026that she can run at 2 * 4 which is eight miles per hour now let\u2019s calculate the actual amounts of time she ran and walked to get 36 hours of activity...how long she was running: so we know she ran for a total of 1.8 hours at a rate of speed that was four times faster than the walking rate..so we have to find what that actually would be. We already know she could run at a rate of speed eight miles per hour\u2026and we also know how many hours she was doing this:1.8 hours. So 1.8 multiplied by 8 or 8 x 1.8 would give us a total running distance of\u202614.4 miles now let\u2019s find how much time she spent walking so if we\u2019re told that the total time was 6 hours\u2026and she only spent about half of it running (not counting the extra .2 hrs) that leaves about half of the time for when she was walking. That means that she walked 6 divided by two which is 3 times 2\u2026which is 3 hours..let\u2019s see what the rate is here\u2026.we know she walks at twice the rate or a quarter of whatever the speed of running is and since she runs at a rate of eight miles per hour and we know one quarter of that is 2 miles per hour we know her walking speed to be 2 miles per hour.

        " running\u2026.So the rest of the time, we\u2019ll be spending 6 - 2 or 4 hours walking. Okay so now we need to convert those speeds to miles/hour so that we can add them all up.

Four is a quarter, so we divide the speed she runs by four\u20264 x .25\u2026=1 mile per hour\u2026so her running speed is 1 mile per hour, but we don\u2019t know the speed that she walks yet. We\u2019re going to keep that as it\u2019s written\u2026.Now we want to convert skipping into miles per hour\u2026skipping is half as fast as running, so multiply the skipping speed by \u00bd\u20263x .5\u2026=1.5 miles per hour\u2026so the sum of the speed when running =1 mile per hour plus the speed when walking which we don\u2019t know\u2026add those together\u20262.5 miles per hour\u2026we plug that back into our equation to see what distance we get\u20262.5x 6 hr..=15 miles which is our final answer\u2026Dana will travel 15 miles in 6 hours.",

If we call this amount of time that she runs x minutes, then we can see she is going to run for \u2153x, and that means she will also walk for 2/3 of the time, or twice as long. Now let\u2019s go back to our equation here\u2026we know that dana walks at a slower rate than she skips, so if she is walking for one third of the time and skipping for another third, then those two speeds need to add up to equal how fast she runs. This gives us 1.3 x miles per hour (the equation reads: the combined rate of speed for her walking plus skipping equals her running speed). Next, let\u2019s find out how far she will be able to run by dividing the total time by 4. We get (\u2154x / 4 ) = miles travelled!. Since we still don\u2019t know exactly how much time Dana spends running, you might think there is no solution\u2026but luckily there is a trick to solving this problem without having to solve any equations at all!",
        " walking, 2 / 6 of the time is spent walking, which makes sense because that\u2019s half, or 2/3rd, of the time. So what we want to know is how far she travels in 2 hours when she is running at a speed that is 4 times faster. Multiply four times faster times 2 hours, so she covers 8 miles. While running, she also cover 2 miles while she was skipping, so she covered a total of 10 miles. But we need to account for all of the walking too. Half of 6 hours would be 3 hours which means that she covers 2/3rds of this distance during that time, or multiplying 3 x 2/3 which equals 2 miles. Adding the 8 miles from the running, plus the 2 miles from the skipping and the 2 miles from the walking equals 12 miles. Therefore Dana travels 12 miles in 6 hours. The answer is: 12.",
        ". To calculate the time traveling at each speed, just use the original speed. Since it took us 2hours to run, we traveled 4 mph * 2 hrs, which equals 8 miles running. We were told to skip at 3 mph so now 3 * 4 hrs = 12 miles while skipping. And finally we walked at 1/4th the speed. That means 1 mph * 4 hours = 4 miles. That's right ! So we can write our answers as 8 miles running, 12 miles skipping, 4 miles walking in total !",

That means in 4 hours she covers 4 miles. We also said before that she would run for 2 hours which means she runs at twice that speed which means she covered the distance in 2 hours at 8mph. Doing the same calculations here we get 8mph is equivalent to 1 mile in a 1/8th hour. And so in two hours she ran the distance at 2 miles per 1/8th of an hour. Which means she ran 8 miles in that time period. To sum up\u2026if we add the two together we get 8 miles plus 4 miles which equals 12 miles. The question says that Dana can run four times faster than she can walk. So what this implies is since she has eight miles covered in the running portion but was able to cover a further four miles in the walking part \u2013 meaning overall her ability to run faster made up for the slower portion and her total distance covered would have been equivalent to four times the amount or 16 miles. The actual number was off by one so she actually ran 15 miles.",
        " 4 hours. But we are using this information later, so I\u2019m not going to put it into words right now. If you want to take notes, write \u201crunning: 2hr, walking: 4hr\u201d. Okay, back to my original point\u2014time\u2014it seems like we need a little more info on the rates of running and walking. What\u2019s the question asking about? We need to know the exact amount of time Dana needs to do all these different things\u2014for example, how fast she walks so we know how far she walks after spending 4 hours! Good news here though; we already got information about the running speeds and skips. To make things clearer, let me reword what we\u2019re told: \"If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour\". This means Dana skips 3 miles an hour. 3 miles per hour is written as 3 mph. And now we get into my favorite part: math equations! The way we want this equation set up is as follows\u2026we start by defining variables which are letters representing unknown quantities (in our case, distance), and then use them throughout an equation\u2014but first make sure everything we\u2019re trying to solve has units attached! So let x be the number of miles Dana will walk over six hours. Let y be the distance traveled while running during that same period, and let z represent what it would take to go at half the speed at which Dana skips when traveling only for four minutes instead of six hours. We also know that walking takes three times longer than skipping because each person walks at 1/3 the same pace as someone who skips 3 miles per hour\u2014since skipping happens every four minutes! Finally, since all motion takes place at constant speeds throughout those four minutes, the distance covered each minute equals the product of our new variable values divided by 60. By substituting our values for x,y,and z into this last formula (distance covered over four minutes) we can finally determine how far apart Dana ran during those three days! If anyone wants to know how I got these values\u2014just ask! Oh yeah\u2014the answer to your question is...10.3 miles",
        " skipping is half as fast as running, we can divide by half...so running is 3 / 2 = 1.5 mph running. She said she can also run at a speed that is 4 times faster than walking which I\u2019m guessing means she can walk at .25 mph (3/4)....since it\u2019s 4 times slower. So that\u2019s about 0.25 mph walking. The answer is: 3 (skip), 1.5 (run), 0.25(walk).",
        " 2=6$ miles per hour. Since she spends about half the time skipping (which is $2/6$) or $\\frac{1}{3}$ the entire time, we can simply calculate how far she traveled skipping or, multiplying $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 6$, which equals $2$ miles. Using the same logic, she travels twice the distance walking compared to running so that is a factor of 4 which becomes $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2$.

It takes her one third of the time to run this distance compared with two thirds for walking; therefore it also takes her 1.5 * 1/3 = 1/2 an hour (or twelve minutes). Using this information we set up a word problem: x * 3 / 6 = x * 1/2, where the x stands for the time spent walking and y represents the amount of time spent running in order to cover a distance of twelve feet. We are able to easily solve this system because there is only one variable being calculated--either x or y. For example:",
        " that this doesn't quite match up perfectly since our initial equation tells us the 'walking' value should be equal to $(1-\\sqrt{2})=0.29$. We round these numbers off since this equation assumes a perfect situation when actually Dana might not run/walk at exactly 6/1.5 every other second throughout the task and thus may be slightly less or more depending on the situation; which makes sense as we assume different things would happen during tasks like sprinting, marathons, etcetera, making them difficult to measure. Anyways let's continue with the rest of the problem using our rounded numbers instead of using the true solution. Dana's total distance is 6 miles, so what she covers running is $6 \\times \\frac{3}{6}\\div 1.5 \\times 3 = 4.2$ miles. What she covers walking is therefore $1.2$ miles, meaning her total time spent walking must be one third that distance, or $3.6$ hours. What she covers while running must take one sixth that time, or $1.8$ hours. Therefore her entire trip will last an overall duration between running/walking that works out to $(6)+(3.6)$ or $(1.8)+(1.8)$ totalling around eight hours ($6+3.6$) plus sixteen minutes(the latter figure being one half our earlier found duration for Dana's trip). The answer is $\\boxed{10}$ hrs, 16 min. Note: This solution was made under the assumption that you only walk or run; however realistically when running/skipping there are also moments when you take breaks which further complicate solving equations using them alone. It is better solved by breaking down complex scenarios into simplified components (involving skipping periods during workouts for instance) since those cases tend to result less accuracy issues within calculations due simply being more realistic models compared to what happens during standard exercise sessions where all activities are uniformly executed without interruptions/changes of pace. Hopefully this helps clear up any confusion regarding why these two figures don\u2019t precisely match up when trying compare them directly side by each other.. Thankfully though both equations still arrive at very close values despite their differences from one another providing a nice consistency despite appearing slightly out of alignment compared to each other\u2019s respective final outcomes here respectively speaking\u2026 Hope this helped!

Given that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, this means she runs at twice that speed or $2 \\times 3$ mph equals $\\boxed{6}$ mph when running.

        " speed, so her running speed is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$mph.We can say that, in one third of the time that Dana spends running, she travels as far as she would have traveled if she walked twice as far as she walked during two thirds of the time. This means that the two speeds were equalized after three hours of total time.In other words, the total distance covered by Dana while walking is equal to the total distance covered by Dana while skipping plus the total distance covered by Dana while running (since they both start out from the same point). Hence, using the proportion again: (Total Distance Walked) / (Number of Hours Walked) = (Distance Skipped + Distance Run) / 6.We already determined that skipping takes up 2/3 of the total time spent traveling so that walking happens during only 1/3. Furthermore, during that 2/3 portion of the time, skipping is happening, and during only 1/6 of the time running is happening. Thus, we get the following equation: (Total Distance Walked) / (2/3) = (Distance Skipped + Distance Run) / (1/6).Simplifying gives: Total Distance Walked * 6 = Distance Skipped + Distance Run * 6. Plugging in what we know from above yields: (3 mph) * (180 minutes / 60 minutes per mile) = (10 miles/hour)*(6 hours).Since the units cancel out nicely, we conclude that Dana travels 180mi in total.The answer is: 180",
