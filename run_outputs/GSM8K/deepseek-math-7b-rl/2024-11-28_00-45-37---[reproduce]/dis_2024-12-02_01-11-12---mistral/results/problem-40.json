Substituting these values back into earlier expressions yields ($Brian = 4 \\times (2 \\times Suzy)$) and ($2 \\times Suzy = 1$) from which we easily obtain ($2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = Brian$ meaning $Brian = 4$).

We know that Brandon's phone was started at the beginning, but here he was still not using the technology and just playing games or something else. In other words, it took around six to eight years until he could finally use something like this for any real purpose. In fact, he might even have gotten into trouble or had someone hurt him, causing this delay, so this number would likely be higher than what it actually was. At least according to math calculations! But anyway, our goal is only figuring out when it stopped being useful and then working back from there to make sense of everything else. So firstly let's subtract seven years from this figure because that puts us close enough for our purposes since after all these events occurred during those years; secondly we need to keep in mind that those numbers could change depending on external factors (like school closures due to COVID).

Third point - the fact remains that even nowadays people don't want to wait very long before they upgrade their phones \u2014 it seems like it's pretty common nowadays for someone who has only had their new phone for about three months to decide it's time they start looking somewhere else as well ;) .

Similarly, since Brandon's iPhone is 4x older than both Benjamin AND Suzy's iPhones, we can deduce that it was created 4x longer ago than them: 4 x 2 = 8 or eight years in other words! Therefore, assuming the data provided is accurate, we now know that there were at least twelve (12) full months spent creating Brandon's current model device before he received it; making his particular unit quite likely an early version produced around ten years prior when such phones first debuted!

Finally take note how cleverly these equations help simplify our mathematical representation !Thanks!!You could also use the following approach: We'll need to know how many phones each person is using, which you already know.
