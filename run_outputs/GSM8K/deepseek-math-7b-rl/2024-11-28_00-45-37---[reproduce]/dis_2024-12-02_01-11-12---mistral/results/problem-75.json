For instance: We can determine what areas exist between 4th and 5th floor by applying: Layer A equals 16 square feet (Top Floor) / 2 because each floor below the Top Floor is twice as small, or half the size; therefore it would equal 16/2 which converts down into 8 Sq ft.

Level 2 is therefore one fourth or half the original area making its value 8 / 2 or 4 respectively and finally for the bottom level which is one fourth or half again making its value 4 / 2 or 2. Now knowing that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it, we can calculate this by using our understanding on ratio. For example let us assume two levels with square footages X and Y where y = X/2 meaning y is twice the size as compared with X (in terms of their respective values). If we multiply both sides by two we get 2Y = X and solving for X we get X = 2Y. This allows us to express any quantity as multiples of another if desired which means knowing that y = 2X and dividing through with two gives us Y = X hence proving our original statement is true! Now let us consider another case involving four levels having square footages A B C D where D = C/2 which could also mean A = (C * 10) and B = (C*10)/2 or simply A / B = 10/5 = 2 meaning there is a ratio of two between two levels if desired and so forth up until we reach level four where D = A / 10 or 1 divided by 2 equals itself due to only considering four points here thus confirming everything stated above being true ! Therefore given these assumptions we can generalize all levels into one equation as follows: level n equals level one times powers ten downwards towards one half of each subsequent level until reaching zero or less than 0 depending upon whether negative integers exist within bounds used for calculations .

Then taking the next level up from there, which is the bottom floor of the sandcastle, and doubling its initial value of 32 gets you to a square footage of 64, which is the middle (or 3rd) layer. And since the answer calls for us to calculate the average square footage per level, we just simply divide the average of all these values to get our result. In this case, our equation becomes: Average Square Footage = ( 32 + 64 + 16 ) / 3. Solving for this yields: Average Square Footage = 13. Which means Luke will average 13 squares per level. The answer is: 13.",
