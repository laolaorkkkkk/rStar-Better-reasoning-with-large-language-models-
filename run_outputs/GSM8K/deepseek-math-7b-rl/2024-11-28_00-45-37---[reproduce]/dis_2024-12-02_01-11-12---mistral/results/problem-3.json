We can run it a third time, which would get us 3 groupings of 9 + 9 = 3 more meters for a grand total of 273. I bet we could do better though, because the last grouping we didn't even need! We only needed 3 groupings, but we also used up all the meters with our first two groups. Our last group didn't help at all since it was empty! The best way would be just to have three groupings again, since all they contain are 9x9 = 81 meters, or 3 groupings each containing 27 meters worth. It adds up to 21 meters when we put those numbers together: 21+21+21 = 21+21+21 = 21+21+21 = 21+21+21 = 63. 21+21+21 = 63 meters total. You could also do that in the other direction; you have three groupings each containing 9 meters, but the last grouping would be empty since we're finished running all 9 distances anyway, so it'd be nothing new being done here: zero new meters run over those final meters means no point wasting your time on them like a wasteful fool. All said and done, three groupings worth 9 meters each is good enough for us right now! But maybe tomorrow we can do a better job if things get too dull around here :)",
