It looks like your explanation went beyond simple arithmetic increment calculations because complex financial models typically involve compounded interest or exponential growth formulas depending upon market conditions \u2014 but let me clarify using simpler math first before diving deeper into concepts related to bond pricing under varying yields.:) Of course, here's a less mathematical yet equally informative breakdown relating Sophie's potential earnings without delving too deeply into finance jargon. Initially, Sarah makes $600 biweekly\u2014equivalent to roughly half her monthly take home since most folks work around eight weeks in their average calendar month. With promotions often linked not directly but indirectly through tenure gains plus merit increases tied sometimes explicitly ('and') occasionally implicitly 'through time served'), such rewards seem logical despite other companies possibly offering them differently based primarily / solely (/ only?)/'performance': i.e., commissions versus hourly rates/(hourly vs.) cash bonuses)). Suppose these raises occur once when reaching full employment duration\u2013say perhaps fifth anniversary celebrations among others afterwards \u2013we still don't know exactly until asked specifically whether additional bonus elements could play any role besides usual cost-of-living adjustments(/ inflation compensators)/productivity uplifts); thus assuming none apply otherwise while ignoring possible tax considerations/-implications altogether(!)(this simplification allows us ignore realism somewhat better)-in fact however having higher income levels usually comes hand &amp;hand(-&amp;)with relatively high corresponding amounts needed toward living expenses (=costlier housing needs etc.), suggesting either reduced saving habits/, spending patterns via consumer behavior theories including psychological aspects",
