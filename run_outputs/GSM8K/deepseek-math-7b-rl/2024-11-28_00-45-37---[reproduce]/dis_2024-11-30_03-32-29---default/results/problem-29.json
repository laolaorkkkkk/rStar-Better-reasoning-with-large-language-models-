        " sum of the prices of the two pairs of high heels (which are $33 and $66 since it states the second pair costs twice as much as the first pair) plus the difference ($5 less than the boots) would equal the price of the boots itself. This situation creates the following algebraic equation: \\( B = (33 + 66) + 5 \\) Simplifying within parentheses first, we get: \\( B = 99 + 5 \\). Adding those numbers together yields the value for the boots: \\( B = 104 \\). Therefore, Gloria finds out that the boots she wants actually cost \\$104. ",
        " double that amount which would be $66) is $5 less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the following equation: B + (33 + 66) = B - 5 This simplifies to: B + 99 = B - 5 To find the value of B, subtract 99 from both sides: B - 99 = -5 Finally, add 99 to both sides to get the value of B: B = 94 Thus, the boots cost 94 dollars.",
