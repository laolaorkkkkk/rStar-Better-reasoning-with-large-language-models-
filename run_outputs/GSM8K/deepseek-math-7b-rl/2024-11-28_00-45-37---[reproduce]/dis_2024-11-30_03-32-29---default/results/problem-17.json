I understand your request involves creating new instructions centered around calculating profits involving time spent doing various tasks within certain constraints but differing significantly than typical arithmetic calculations. Each instruction incorporates elements such as sales rates, costs associated with activities not related directly linked to profit generation (like meal expenses while training animals instead of selling them), multi-facet aspects adding complexity like varying unit prices based upon factors unrelated to traditional business models ('potion making'), plus unusual market conditions influencing sale quantities ('futuristic robotic creatures').

This would still not take into account holidays/vacations nor overtime wage changes while getting adjustments made depending upon those variables based factors too!

Hence overcoming misconception while accounting directly might aid accuracy better! We also note here though regarding full calendar term rather simply dividing everything equally across different periods wouldn\u2019t render best results either \u2013 especially considering various factors involved could significantly influence overall income fluctuations throughout any specific timeline beyond mere arithmetic calculations based upon simple average estimates without fully understanding them yet !

Similarly when it comes to cheering leading workouts; here too using same methodology(i.e., multiplying quantity against their respective unit price), you get $(15*30)$= $450.$ Here again adding them together results into $$$($700+$450)=$$$or $$$ ($1150). As mentioned earlier this amount represents only one working month or fourteen days outlook considering no breakages taken throughout any period till date... But wait , I donot quite know about those vacation periods.. Right off the bat i can see few discrepancies & errors within our calculations.(if u noticed correctly while reading my previous post)!

        " a coaching trainee, it would cost $30 x 15 hours/week = $450 every week. We can add these amounts together (because this question involves both jobs) so she makes approximately ($700+$450)/week =$1150 /week. Since she only needs about half a work time when multiplying everything out again ,the amount earned annually becomes ~($1150)*(50))*year=~57500$,which leaves us with our finalized result being around  57500$. Therefore, if Jennifer chooses option C which says roughly $58k,this could imply rounding up slightly due to approximation throughout calculations or possible tax considerations not mentioned initially. However strictly adhering just based off initial numbers presented without accounting anything beyond basic math computations like income distribution over months etc.,it comes down closer towards Option B:$54K rounded instead because actual calculated value didn't match either extreme provided options leaving no other choice but settling mid way thus making Choice B correct among available selections under typical circumstances assuming all variables remain constant including employment terms agreed upon beforehand during contractual engagements governing financial transactions linked through specific monetary compensation schemes applied consistently irrespective changing dynamics perhaps associated within context spanning across business cycles while taking into consideration standard conventions relevant applicable according normative operational parameters prescribing respective pay scales contingencies pertinent relative employee responsibilities fulfilling requisite tasks aligned against predefined criteria hence ensuring fair treatment abiding guidelines set forth pursuant organizational bylaws setting precedence conformity expectancies thereby fostering equitable environment facilitating healthy growth trajectory encouraging productivity enhancing efficiency optimizing resource utilization minimizing costs maximizing output yield increasing overall corporate success promoting stability longevity guarantee safeguarding investments assurance profitability sustaining competitive advantage bolstering shareholder confidence upholding ethical standards protecting rights defending individuals wellbeing advocating societal benefit contributing positively influencing communal cohesion driving progress empowering self development assistive learning opportunities propelling individual capabilities amplifying skills harnessing potential unlocking latent talent nurturing innovation fostering creativity spark inspiration igniting passion fuel burning desire motivating relentless determination building resilience construct",
        " income per week would therefore amount to $700 (from teaching) + $450 (from coaching) = $1150 per week. Over course of a working month or 50 weeks, this amounts to $1150 x 50 weeks = $57,500 annually. Thus, her combined annual salary equals her summed up quarterly payments totalling all four quarters within one year. Hence, her total annual salary adds up to ($1150 x 13weeks )+($57500)=$11,800+$57,500=$69,300 altogether. Therefore, Jill makes approximately around sixteen thousand nine hundred thirty dollar(\u2248$16930 USD). However if rounding needs to occur because no currency fractions exist it could also mean eighty seven thousand minus three zeros making nineteen grand considering possible discrepancies due to partial months not accounted during computation like taxes deductions etc.. Yet such calculations aren\u2019t mentioned so using mathematical precision leads us toward seventeen million plus twenty four thousands equal figures hence answering 'sixteen thousand nine hundred third figure'. Still maintaining strict math integrity without alterations adheres closer towards \u2018seventeen millions forty seconds estimate\u2018 while ignoring unspecified variables possibly impacting calculated output thus concluding upon first established reasoning based solely off provided contextual inputs despite potential real world influences affecting accurate fiscal determinism otherwise stated .

        " (i.e., all 50 weeks) throughout the year without taking any leaves or holidays off work; Multiplying this figure across, it becomes obvious thus: That makes Jill\u2019s overall net annual income equal to approximately around ($1150 per Week)*(50 Weeks Per Year)=$57,500 annually.. ",
        " of working weeks (50). This comes out to a monthly income amounting to $1150 x 50 or around $57500. Hence, it can be said her annual gross income stands close to about fifty thousand seven hundred sixty dollars approximately when taking into account only these mentioned sources of remuneration without deductions like taxes etc.. Thus ensuring adequate financial stability alongside maintaining professional engagements in both realms if so desired. "
