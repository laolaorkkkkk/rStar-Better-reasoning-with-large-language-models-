Thus gerald s running time post improvement falls within acceptable limits unlike before but even better because having fewer obstacles makes life easier while still maintaining balance/health benefits too hence fulfilling physical goals despite being overweight already due heavy workload causing mental stress associated w psychological conditions leading towards obesity etc...

This tells us nothing about garrds improvement overtime due todieting though however still based off current data lets calculate! First thing before any calculation let me clarify just once again here:- Lets consider F(speed)=k/(D^m), k value depends upon human capability while m signifies degree effectiveness among similar physical activities such as sprinting long distances etc.). It also implies greater values translate directly into reduced performances owning its inverse relationship hence our formula becomes f_o = n / ((x**a)+b);=(n/((w*p)*r));F_i=f_g , r being constant across all scenarios including both parties mentioned above ;this equation applies regardless whether you increase resistance within environment OR decrease external load . Herein I shall assume variables remain unchanged apart form modification applied solely towards fatty acid metabolism caused via calorie restrictions resulting ~~from~~ alterations;thus reducing basal rate subsequently diminishing output capacity thereby necessitating higher effort levels requiring additional input energy required further increasing expenditure ratio ..This translates back unto increased rates compared pre-intervention measures thus implying possible improvements albeit marginal ones may prevail post completion phase depending specific individual responses dictated primarily genetic makeup itself ?

        " if gerard hadn't adjust his timing beforehand (or changing his time means increasing efficiency).

This implies Gerald took longer(since less efficient )running upfront . Improved performance or decreased completion rates usually equate roughly into percentage decline equivalent to its initial deficit thus meaning Gordon`s improvement ratio here refers back onto himself as being initially outpaced by another competitor.. Meaning Gerdan improves his finishing rate based off comparison:`new gordain finishes=(previous gap/Gender%)+original record; i.e.(38*1+(4+((38*(doubleofoneovertenpercent)/10)))=->=>=>35(rounded)`.
