Adding these amounts together makes the original bill come up as approximately $752.48.

        " far back these rules apply so no confusion here! To find out what our future value equation looks like first up lets take care all numbers involved.. We know FV equals (P)present plus r(interest), which means P=FV*(r+1)^n , N being time period expressed annually such that n denotes exponent applied via division operation . That makes sense right ? Well not quite yet; recalling Algebraic Transformations Rule II -- Power & Root Powers : \"(a^b)/c =\" sqrt [(ac)(ab)] applies when solving exponential problems including finding roots/extrapolated values through logarithmic conversions involving base b powers ; meaning raising certain variables together increases their magnitude exponentially compared against baseline constants while multiplying other parts decreases same rate linearly hence leading simpler solution methods down paths otherwise complex beyond initial scope unless specifically necessary .. But why bother learning those concepts anyway ? Its usefulness lies within simplification purposes ! ;) Anyway again keeping things basic therefore applying above power rule formula directly yields us squared root equivalent form ^((x^(y*z))/(w))=(sqrt[(xy+w)*yz])--which implies subtraction outside brackets thus reducing complexity further into terms easily solvable visibly alongside manipulating remaining factors appropriately before combining similar components finally arriving @ definitive conclusion below....",
