        ". Let's say the number of silver coins Gretchen has is represented by S. According to the statement, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins would be S + 30. We know the total number of coins (gold plus silver) adds up to 110 coins. Thus, our equation becomes:   S + (S + 30) = 110 Solving for S, we combine like terms first getting:   2S + 30 = 110 Subtracting 30 from both sides provides us with:    2S = 80 Next, dividing both sides by 2 yields:      S= 40 This means Silver Coin Number Equals 40 But since Gold coin numbers equal Silvers Plus Thirty Or simply;         BlueCoinNumber=(SilverCount)+Thirty Given what was solved above, therefore blueCoinNumberOrsimplyGoldCoinsWouldTotalEquals FourtyPlusThirty And thus Simply Put Total OfAllBlueOrGreenBallsAddToEighteen",
