That means rather than buying exactly double what standard packaging contains(i.e., twenty four servings vs just eighteen when considering a single pair measurement used above ,you buy slightly over twice as much); thus calculating costs involves dividing eightyfive dollars across those sixty four servings yielding about fifteen cents less off a dollar compared to buying full twelves($55/$4+~$0.15).
