        " indeed gone overtime....or even better yet---their times combined add together nicely because our three fits into six twice meaning when their amounts get put back together $$ {6} \\cdot  3\\ =$$ yes 6+6 or twelve not nineteen which might lead someone down thinking somehow these aren't correct answers.. However consider adding four sevenths onto both numbers ($$$\\frac{4}{7}$$$) making all whole multiples work fine no matter whether multiplying them individually afterwards using prime factors etc.--now let me show u my solution here instead thanks guys :) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%E2%8A%AF&assumption=%22TimePeriodMathematics%22+-%3E%7B%22DurationOnlineGameplayCalculationOrDraftingTournamentsToCumulativeRoundsWithoutCountInBaseball%22%7D [Quiet] &lt;image /&gt; Okay holdup ! i know math works best explained visually rather quickly sometimes though still want u knowing why such large discrepancy exists anyways bcuz most people tend toward guessing stuff like fractions without really getting stuck em --- oh well anyway great job solving yourself already ^_^ PS sorry couldn ; I didn't mean anyone gets discouraged easily cause everyone else struggles through problems themselves too hahaha enjoy ur homework!!

        " (which is 6) from the number of hours Harroth slept (which is 9). That means 9 - 6 equals 3. Therefore, Harry slept three more hours than James. The answer is: 3. ",
        " in their sleeping time was 3 hours. However, your question asks 'how much **more**'. By this interpretation it would mean calculating absolute value (i.e., disregarding which person actually slept less or more) , hence regardless if you substract John\u2019s age when Bill was born(15yrs), since both times express amount already past years old & thus cancels itself out during comparison; negative symbol indicates direction towards younger ages so use positive num instead : |John_age+15| -> |2x Age+(Age-(currentYear-BirthYear))|..Simplified gets us back again our original equation without modification needed!
