And finally note here another important piece of information: It also says exactly when merideth began working later during our story \u2013 specifically starting from sunday lasting throughout friday:) Therefore both mentioned events occurred within four consecutive weeks(weeks start counting saturday & end until friday): therefore no change occurs through all stated periods!

As one article requires 4hrs we get another batch worth of time equaling this quantity 7*4=<<7*4=28>>28 hours on Tuesday. Since she completed double on Wednesday compared to what she finished up during the previous single working day i.e., Friday hence if you add both quantities; she worked over these couple of workdays thrice equals third multiplication order or triples meaning overall tripled effort resulting also equalling multiplicative output yielding altogether 2*(Tuesday + Thursday).

Considering that she doubled the productivity seen when working on articles over previous period , merieth works towards producing exactly twice (or equivalently same number but faster )on Weds hence translating into similar work output only differing mainly due to increased speed or time efficiency thereby reducing overall duration involved.

        " This means this amount could also be expressed mathematically like this: (2/5)*5+5= 2+5 = 7 articles. Again, taking into account the fact that each written piece needs four hours per item, during work time you receive here, therefore Meredith spends 4*(7) = <<4*7=28>>28 hours working towards completing these tasks in just one day.
