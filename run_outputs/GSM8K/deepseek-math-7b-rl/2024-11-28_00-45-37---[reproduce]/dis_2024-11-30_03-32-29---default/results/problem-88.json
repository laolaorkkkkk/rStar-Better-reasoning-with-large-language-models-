Therefore, if their records add up to 88,000 units together, Harald would account for only 8800 CD /DVD unit sales because the statement states that 'Four less than twice harold\u2019s album shows half marilyn\u2019s'.

According to the problem, Marilyn's sales (M) are equal to ten times what Harald sold, so M = 10H. It also says their combined sales amounted to 88,000 units, which means H + M = 88,000. Since we know M = 10H, we substitute it into the second equation resulting in H + 10H = 88,000 or 11H = 88,000. When solved further, dividing both sides of the equation by 11 results in H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 records. This checks because if you add Marilyn's 80,000 records to Harald's 8,000, the sum indeed comes to 88,000 records; thus confirming our solution! ",
