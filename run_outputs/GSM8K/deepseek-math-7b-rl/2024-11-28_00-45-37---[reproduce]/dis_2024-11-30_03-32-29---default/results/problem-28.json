The distance between both locations would therefore be measured as 25 miles because we subtract all other segments besides what exists specifically within these coordinates. We could also confirm our findings through addition; adding up the three separate distances covered yields precisely back into accountable numbers \u2013 namely  3 hours \u00d7 average speed per hour equals overall journey length which equates directly to initial stated figure i.e., totals come together accurately thereby corroborating original calculation route adopted hereinabove elucidated. Thus upon thorough deliberation over presented parameters concerning said bikers progress across stipulated landmarks denoted throughout described narrative enriches understanding vis-\u00e0-vis such dynamic traversal exercise undertaken concomitantly observed whilst embracing requisite necessary modifications rendered pertinent thereto based solely off extant chronological indications outlined henceforth depicted sequentially referenced explicitly denoting respective temporal benchmark delineating commencement along parallel continuum tracery extending subsequent terminal epoch manifest distinctively articulated quantitative data set forth promulgated exempli gratia illustrative tabulation embodying specific instance particularization explicative synthesis harmonizing correlatively entwined components amalgamating coherently unified interrelated intrinsic constituents substantiating empirical correlation validation accordance integrality authentic veracity integrity affirmatory evidence ratification certitude precision rigorous accuracy infallibility definiteness certainty exactness indubitable reliability flawless dependability irrefutable steadfastness absolute confidence assurance sureness absoluteness unequivocal surety alacrity immediacy promptness expeditious punctual concord swift synchronicity tempo celeritas velocitatis velocity rapide sparsita acceleratio temporaribus tempus segmento minuto secundo et sexusto terto nonno quartodesexoctotertdecies quadrupetri quatrior vigintiquatrice duodenove decem novensdecet octondecimo septendecim undeviginti triginta viginti primi secundos centesimos millies subunits fractionas ultra parti minus viridi nulla negativa nullitatis minimale zero cero uno diez dos tres cuatro cinco seis siete ocho nueve catorce quince treinta y seis cuarenta y si"
