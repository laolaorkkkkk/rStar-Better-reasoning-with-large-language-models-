Therefore ,billie was able to earn income only from those seven purchases so bob makes sale of seventy items or video cassettes within business hours before work starts again tomorrow morning;that said it would appear unlikely someone could really afford multiple rental agreements considering current rent prices alongwith fact individuals generally find entertainment anywhere aside form home movie collections!

It therefore seems likely enough whether intentionality lies behind them both together because every time someone buys anything outside normal parameters without explicitly requesting special treatment like maybe going overtime limits themselves\u2014and especially so when doing something unusual involving payment conditions beyond standard protocol rules--there may very possibly exist exceptions within certain contextual constraints allowing extra privileges under specified circumstances too....which ones might apply here ?
