        " bush has 25 roses and he has 3 rose bushes, it would be 25 multiplied by 3 which equals to 75 roses. To find out how many thorns all these roses collectively hold we multiply their amount times one another (in this case multiplication). Thus if each having eight spikes or 'thorns', you can calculate like so;  75*8= 600. Therefore our first line yields us the statement, `total_roses = rose_bushes * roses_per_bush`, making variable replacement such as --`total_roses = 3 * 25`. Our second expression calculates just below them using similar logic but referring instead directly towards variables declared previously thus yielding--our second statment `--spikes_from_all_roses = total_roses * spikes_on_each_rose `. Hence together combining above lines ,we finally obtain your solution stating:`final_answer = spikes_from_all_roses -> final_answer == 600 . That means dance dancing! I see your point about not overcomplicating things too quickly though!. Great explanation Sir!! Thanks alot!!! Good job :) ",
        " 3 rose bushes, this means dan has a total of 3 * 25 = 75 roses. As stated above, if every one of these roses possesses 8 prickly bristles or 'thorns', the collective sum amounts to as follows; Total Thorns equals Rose Count multiplied by individual rose quantity (or 75*8). This calculation totals up to be equaling approximately 600. Thus your numerical solution would read like so. Final Summary ",
        " roses. And since each rose has 8 thorns so it means 75x8 which equals to  600. Therefore, all together this amounts as 600thorns. This problem actually requires multiplication operations instead simple addition because you want firstly know about amount of items (roses), than multiply them individually against quantity needed(number of spines/thorns). Just keep track while multiplying larger quantities vs smaller ones; large numbers can get confusing when using mental math techniques or calculators! Hence why these concepts tend towards being taught through practice problems rather quickly among learners who wish gain proficiency over quick calculating abilities amongst themselves via various ways like algorithms etc..
