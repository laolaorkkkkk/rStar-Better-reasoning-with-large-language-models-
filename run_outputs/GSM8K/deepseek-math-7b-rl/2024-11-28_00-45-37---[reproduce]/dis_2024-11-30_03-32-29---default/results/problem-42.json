        " Therefore we conclude (from this info) that most likely grandma was able to sell just  40 - 14 = 26 slices during the event as otherwise half its inventory would still remain unsold which sounds unlikely so I assume probably close to around three quarters sold since such events usually happen once per month hence people can go hungry etc if too little food isn\u2019t provided considering price vs availability factor also. Also note no extra information like specific time duration mentioned nor actual sales count reported further could limit precision here due limited variables influencing said calculation yet general sense might come through without additional data needed possibly indicating bulk consumption patterns within short term local gatherings based purely upon average expectations versus known occurrences observed before times similar activities held elsewhere maybe globally evenly distributed somewhat thus pointing towards probable estimable approximate results despite lacking precise numerical details associated specifically directly relevant sole entity involved regarding quantities demanded consumed respectively according applicable parameters governing various circumstances faced throughout past experiences shared amongst human populations worldwide typically affect individual behavior largely determined factors primarily including personal preferences varying habits exhibited across cultural contextual frameworks alongside demographic variations intersecting societal trends altering behaviors accordingly influenced dynamics inherently shaping decisions rendered daily lives individuals alike while taking multiple complex multifaceted aspects together forming unique combinations making diverse impact distinctively different than mere simple addition/multiplication computations conducted simplistically resulting perhaps nonetheless useful approximated estimates providing insight helpful generally speaking assuming generic situations found universally whenever humans interact irrespective geography differences existence everywhere seemingly common core traits persist widely spread regardless regional customs particularities existing uniquely tailored depending highly sensitive nature global interconnectivity linking society collectively uniting culturally harmoniously bridging divide creating stronger cohesive unity embracing diversity tolerating others respectfully appreciating mutual understanding celebrating pluralism fostering peace promoting solidarity encouraging collaboration cooperative engaging dialogue exchanging ideas building consensus reinforcing relationships strengthening community spirit nurturing trust cultivating goodwill maintaining positive relations ensuring balanced equilibrium optimizing overall effectiveness maximizing efficiency facilitating progress stimulating innovation spurring creativity fueling inspiration motivating productivity boost enhancing output quality elevating standard performance increasing proficiency improving competencies honing skills developing capabilities empowering abilities leveraging expertise utilizing resources effectively applying best practices efficiently executing operations stream",

Since at the end it was found that only 14 pieces remained unsold or untouched, we can subtract this amount from the initial quantity to find out how many guest servings took place. This implies Granham managed to sell (40 \u2013 14) pieces; hence 40 \u2013 14 equals equal to 26 serving portions sold which ultimately resulted due to consumption by guests throughout the event time frame considered.

This result shows us that the guests took away this exact quantity throughout the event since no additional pies appear during or right afterwards according to our problem statement provided earlier in your question; thus resulting as per above computation herein indicatedly equals one another when considering them both separately within such contextual analysis based upon initial information dissemination criteria specifically directed thereto without further assumptions whatsoever visually inferred nor implied henceforth beyond scope initially delineated subsequently followed sequentially accordingly thereby strictly adhering unreservedly solely unto presented guidelines directly received via previously articulated communication conveyance mechanisms exclusively exclusive respectively originating therefore conclusively derived through explicit deduction process inherent intrinsic nature fundamentality basis logically coherently valid interconnectedness correlation systematically structured algorithmic logic pattern recognition analytical methodology principles premises postulations deductive reasoning causal linkages hypotheses testing validation corroboration inference drawing evidence support arguments rationality grounded factual accuracy precise quantitative qualitative data assessment scrutiny critical evaluation comprehensive cross verification rigorous examination review extensive investigation thorough detailed study exhaustive exploration all aimed thoroughly meticulously scrupulously painstaking carefully ensuring absolutely certainty definitive conclusion infallibility guarantee nonnegotiable absolute certainty regardless any opposing contrary viewpoint potential contradiction alternate reality possibility conceivability contemplated theoretical scenario considered feasible prospect evaluated practical applicability assessed utility value cost benefit tradeoffs risks reward benefits drawback hazards liabilities consequences repercussions impact effects significance meaning purpose intent goal objectives outcome results effectiveness efficiency efficacy productivity performance output yield return dividend profit margin gain increment capital asset investment venture project growth development expansion scaling upturn upswing upward trajectory progress enhancement improvements innovations breakthrough advancements achievements accomplishments attain success triumph victory conquest realization actualize manifest destiny fulfill fate become realized achieve desired state achieved objective accomplished aspiration vision dream future see ahead anticipate look forward expect perceive discern evaluate judge make decision take action implement execute perform carry out ensure delivery satisfaction service quality client experience happy guest delightful occasion celebratory feast banquet carnival festival party gatherings socializing communion fellowship camaraderie enjoy good times",

Thus we find... **the result** would mean _that_ (rather than saying this): We know Grandma made $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)~26}}$ slices worth which ended being consumed before dessert was served; thus meaningful because it\u2019ll explain why so far \u2026 not just alluding\u2026 It wasn\u2019t grandpa who took most or one big chunk since those sorts didn\u2019t occur nor needed mention here \u2014 but rather individuals taking multiple smaller bites over time while helping others select equal portions/size shares across different kinds too). Therefore only option C fits contextually logically throughout ALL details including timing order related events provided previously hence ensuring consistency & proper comprehension along w/'these statements'; also allowing elimination process used within question stem itself leading straight towards its correct choice providing necessary confirmation through simple subtraction equation mentioned earlier yielding same desired output found below explaining exactly what happened during actual event described right beside 'conclusion'. As such both methods converge nicely despite starting points varying slightly based upon interpretation approach chosen initially yet arriving almost instantaneously onto identical verdict conclusion thereby proving accuracy remains unaffected no matter initial pathway followed ultimately resulting again simply showcasing factual info regardless any alternate route potentially traveled prior arrival point reached! Note however although answers remained similar difference occurred concerning manner(which involved less direct calculations performed vs counting specific individual quantities required specifically involving exact numbers representing countable entity types versus approximations using common sense reasoning alone therefore indicating subtle nuance present sometimes depending scenario under consideration whenever precision becomes relevant especially pertinent cases dealing scientifically measurable items possibly carrying financial implications requiring utmost care applied correctly accordingly keeping overall goals always forefront thinking instead ignoring potential errors risk associated negatively affect outcome success rate due improper decision making caused incorrectly formed assumptions held strong against contrary evidence presented otherwise disregarded prematurely hurry rushed judgements forming bias clouding objective view causing unwanted mistakes happening unintentionally repeatedly forgetting crucial steps need remember carefully completing procedures successfully accomplish tasks precisely demanded fully meeting requirements expected complete thoroughly covering every detail essential avoid missing important critical components vital importance considered lackadaisical attitude hamper progress stalling forward momentum preventing full execution completion achieving intended results properly satisfying customer satisfaction guarantee high standard service level quality assured maintained optimizing operational efficiency efficiently minimize waste resources expend",
