        " above; Bailes initial wealth plus (her earnings during those same period) equals Total Amount Endowed ($100). Mathematically represented below equation would look like this.. {X+($40)}=$100 By rearranging terms within bracket so that it moves outside brackets you get something similar as shown here ;{x+$40}$=Total assets ended$. Therefore ${(x*y)}$+${(z)+$}={total}; therefore since z=(Earnings)$40 which was calculated earlier ({eq}*$ )({@}=amount bailey spent using Earnings/$), plugged into formula above becomes ...${(x)*(any value)}{}+{$40}{+ {$40}}$=${total sum }$ => $(xy){}+{$40}{+ {$40}}$=$(cents)/$(dollars)=end balance As all amounts involved relate only to dollar currency values hence our working calculations can equally refer themselves directly relating solely upon units attached specifically associated wiith '$', eg [Cents]{Dollar Equivalent}, making calculation process simple but still applicable regardless whether use Cents instead Dollars when considering entire problem context involving Monetary quantities always related thereto specific unit symbol tied exclusively either way towards representing actual monetary magnitude equivalent . Simplified view may even include further assumption regarding potential lack knowledge concerning basic mathematical principles yet still expect result accurate reflective reality otherwise no point discuss math concept!
