Thus as such both calculations match up providing same result, meaning the calculation using second formula doesn't alter anything leading back again onto our starting solution hence confirming validity; Hence max{[half early-(full later)]}=difference([total needed less available]) which ends up being difference([60-40]), therefore yielding required output ;which means minimum additional portions either having or lacking when compared against equivalent amounts previously supplied equals sum((abs[(halved first part)-(equivalent)],resultant); Hereupon solving math equations & arriving upon determined resolution finally establishes accurate factual figures thereby accurately identifying exact requisite measure specifically dictated within presented query .
