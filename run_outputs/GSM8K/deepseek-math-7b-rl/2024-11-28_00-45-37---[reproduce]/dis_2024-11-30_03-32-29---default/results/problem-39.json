Therefore her rowing pace would need to be double her skidding distance because rows back just once every couple steps taken which leads us to believe Dana runs at forty eight kilometers per hour(km/h) [Note I made adjustments here so all measurements follow consistent units]. It follows thus that Dana walks at fifteen km/h.(speed divided by factor=resultant average; therefore dividing twentyfour kmph into fourth groups yields twelve*two plusthree equalling thirtyone+kmspphsince we consider factors of unity)[we divide distances according to relative speeds] .

        " her skipping pace (which equals going backwards) becomes our starting point because it tells us directly what distance could cover when not standing still during these activities; let\u2019s figure out both rates separately first before putting them together into combinations based on available ratios provided earlier in question statement \u2013 meaning we need info about other speeds besides just 'twice.' We know twice here isn\u2019t correct either though due careless calculation errors mentioned prior! To solve such problem effectively requires understanding relative velocity concept\u2014that being said you ought apply logic which makes use terms like \u2018slow,\u2019\u2018medium,\u2019and\u201cfast\u201d helpful instead merely numerical ones alone unless additional context offered would render otherwise possible calculations precise indeed Otherwise wrong conclusions may result especially when dealing complex scenarios involving variable movements over specified periods Examples include different terrains affecting motion etc Or perhaps differnet weight distributions causing shifts throughout certain actions Time spent doing diverse motions impact overall traveled distances Thus breaking down tasks systematically increases success likelihood Implement following methodology correctly thus avoid potential misinterpretations resulting incorrect results Also remember verification process ensures accuracy hence recommended practice Always reassess findings comparing against known benchmark figures/ranges Prioritizing clear communication along way facilitates collaborative troubleshooting Should issues arise seeking advice clarifies any doubts helps ensure best course taken Moving ahead considering above considerations Calculation steps follow : Let's determine initial values needed according setup information From condition ",
        " (that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to correspond directly to something which actually makes sense physically). Since no other information about distances involved during any type of motion except skiting was provided it seems reasonable (though maybe counterintuitive) enough simply take these speeds/distances and divide them into third parts outlined in question according to what proportion of overall duration spent doing different things respectively over specified period of interest \u2013 i.e., split up whole distance covered /time taken ($=\\frac{Distance}{Speed}=Time$) based on percentages mentioned earlier here namely $\\left(\\frac13,\\frac23\\right)$. Therefore let us firstly determine fractions representing actual amounts traveled corresponding above respective conditions using formula(in terms):$\\begin{aligned} & T_R =\\frac{T}{\\frac13}\\\\ \\\\&T_W = \\frac{2T}{\\frac23}\\end{aligned}$Now substituting known values yields:$T_R=\\frac{T_{skipped}}{1}=\\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{3^{-1}}\\implies R_{\\text {avg }}={(+3)(+\\infty)}=+\\infty \\, \\text { mi }\\\\ \\\\$$T_W=\\frac{\\tfrac{2}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}=(-\\frac{2}{3})[(-1)]^{\\epsilon}=-(-\\infty)\\equiv +\\infty \\, \\text { mi } .$In conclusion , taking summed both previous resultants together would yield :sum $T_{\\text {total}}=T_\\text{(run)}\\pm{} T_\\text{(walk)})=$ $(+(+\\infty))-(+\\infty)=+\\infty$Hence our solution thus indicates possible amount range within entirety ranging anywhere form zero through all real numbers greater than positive infinity inclusive due fact not having bounded upper limit being supplied via text ; however despite lack explicit constrain providing value could likely lie somewhere towards latter portion ie larger integers even though less precise bound may exist depending contextual circumstance applied specifically relative scenario presented beforehand.. Note similarly likewise similar calculation technique employed prior apply also works well whenever required involving specific example cases beyond those delineated previously henceforth; see Examples section immediately following illustration below!Example:(i) Suppose instead asked say find average velocity across said journey calculated sole individual components separately afterwards combined appropriately accordingly ..

To find out exactly why you need such calculation check https://www.mathspeleo.com/lesson/distance-rate-time . We already mentioned above that during those first third part o the trip she manages to cover $(12\\text{+6})\\text{ mile}$in $\\dfrac13$, leaving us with remaining distances to consider divided into further periods. Each next period represents another twothird portion of entire length. As far as I understand your question ,therefore : Distance traveled before taking rest would also account fo rthe same kinda division thus resulting in doubled value relative to previous calculations(i.e.:first fraction)\u2014namely,$12\\text{.}\\left(\\dfrac23 \u00d7 1\\right)\\times 6=\\dfrac {48}{3}=16$. Same goesfor second segment$(6.\\left(\\dfrac23 \u00d7 1\\right)\u00d7 6)=12 $.Now adding them all togetherwe get:$3+(12)+(16)+(12)=$total distance equals to$\u00a023$\\text{mile}$.
