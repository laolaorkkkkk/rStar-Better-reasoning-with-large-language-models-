But as dogs don\u2019t switch diets right away upon becoming adult we subtract half part (the midway point) considering partial usage i.e., divide 5/2= 2.5 rounded up equals three additional packs hence adding them altogether results into; Total Dog Food Packages required amounting upto around six bags.
