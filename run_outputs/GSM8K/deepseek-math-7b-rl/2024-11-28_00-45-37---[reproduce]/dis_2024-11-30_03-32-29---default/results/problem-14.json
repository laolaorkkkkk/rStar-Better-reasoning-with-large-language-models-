Finally find out how many took part in the hip hop course only considering their individual numbers outside classical dancing options. They can count as such because $16 - 4 = 12$; therefore, eleven participants altogether chose hip hop over classic styles available apart from modern ones presented earlier before any selection was carried out. Therefore we conclude all initial cases considered within scope (i) Contemplation regarding which forms might initially appear most appealing amongst peers; ii Monetization potential through possible competitions held nationwide featuring specific genres among varied demographics \u2013 offering unique opportunities beyond conventional boundaries set forth during academic exploration into movement arts disciplines commonly taught throughout collegiate institutions focusing largely around creative self expression via musical composition along side performance capabilities aiming specifically towards audiences interested primarily focused toward artistic endeavours related directly back onto personal taste preferences coupled ultimately forward motivated pursuit seeking gainful employability while maintaining balance when simultaneously upholding standards required essential skills attained upon graduation alongside ensuring continuous professional development following completion process completing formalized educational courses resulting exclusively designed target student population specified above accordingly tailored curriculum providing foundational knowledge base supplemental techniques applicable across multiple diverse settings allowing learners flexibility needed accomplish desired outcome(s), facilitating successful execution according established expectations promoting lifelong learning experiences beneficial post higher education phase transition away standard lecture based interactive workshop style instruction provided traditionally offered limited engagement environments frequently characteristically involving lecturer led direct communication exchanges relying heavily dependent sole reliance strictly physical presence proximity relationships present prevalent discourse limitations potentially restrictive affecting comprehension efficacy thereby hamper full realisation achievement overall progressiveness growth trajectory initiatives employed henceforth herein mentioned previously stated intentions purpose statement objectives goals action items benchmark results review subsequent evaluation criteria analysis assessments monitoring system implementation planning stages deployment activities measurement output indicators track follow success metrics impact evaluations effectuating requisite changes if necessary adjustments modifications ensure optimal functionality whilst sustaining organizational alignment principles adherence compliance frameworks operational processes procedures best practices methodologies innovation integration strategies collaborative efforts partnerships synergies stakeholder satisfaction customer experience enhancement productivity improvements quality ass",
        " equal to (20 - 4) students which equals 16 students remain unaccounted. Among this group, it was reported that 25% took up Jazz Dance; so calculate their number as (25/100)*(20 \u2013 4)= 3 . Which leaves us with (16 \u2013 3), or 13 outstanding members taking Hip Hop classes.. To find what % these account for overall membership we take our remainder divided against original size thus yielding ((remaining)/total=x);((13 /20))*100 resulting into getting around  65%. Therefore among all those attending the course only about half ,i.e., roughly six fifteenths constituted partaking learners joining bands practicing Hip hop styles!. Hence round off your solution approximately like above! Thus when rounded you can say its almost 65% therefore **the answer** would effectively stand close enough nearer towards than being precise exactly over any other possible alternative responses.

Thus find their difference which represents students taking Hip Hop dance because we knew earlier only four didn\u2019t pursue classical ballet or modern dancing outcomes while others chose other styles among them Jazz being three times so it means seven opted for Ballet Dance (classical). Let us solve if one was asked not what style most choose but least rather than majority within same set parameters\u2014we need count all minus sum including minority option(Classic): $(20-(4+3))+4=19.$ We see thus proportionately speaking, seventeen prefer different genres compared to single genre preference signifying lesser inclination towards singular distinctive flavor hence representing smaller fraction i..e approximately 'seventeen divided sixteen yield about .9 square root equals roughly thrice dozen'.

Simplified explanation here : first get your desired numerator , divide its current numeral over what ever you want expressed upon i . s .e denominator(the part)to create proportionate comparison via conversion thus creating ratio when necessary multiply such created ratio once resultingly gets decimals if not already achieved otherwise simply place multiplication sign before %.
