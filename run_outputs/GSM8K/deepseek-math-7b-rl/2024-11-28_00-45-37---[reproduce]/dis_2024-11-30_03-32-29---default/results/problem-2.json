And let me know any errors etc @@user Welcome! Please find below my detailed calculation considering everything mentioned about Josh\u2019s case before getting into equation based formula :   As per details provided, Initially Josh purchased Property worth $80,000 which also includes initial Labor spendings & Material expenses within ($). These amount comes directly towards Calculation referred as \u2018Initial Amount Invested'. Following upon purchasing same, It clearly mentions again 'Replaced parts', indicating additional Expense invested over time without mentioning their exact values initially but known subsequently came around '$50,000.' Therefore, Combined Effort required altogether totals down as follows:-    $80,000++-$50,000=${eq}\\text{AmountInvested}=${eq}$30,000     Further detail continues saying House depreciated 15% following renovations & hence implies overall additionality due to labor efforts directed inside structure thereby leading us to calculate Renovated Marketing Values via Equation :-      Post Buying Restoration workshop carried throughout space leads Housing infrastructure enhancing ultimately resulting housing quality lifecycle thus increasing home attractiveness amongst potential buyers.
