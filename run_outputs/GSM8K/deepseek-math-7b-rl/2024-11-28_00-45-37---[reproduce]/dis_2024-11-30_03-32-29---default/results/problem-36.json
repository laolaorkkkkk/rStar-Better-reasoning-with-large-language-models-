What\u2019s confusing here? Firstly, all answers seem reasonable. However, if I read the initial question too quickly without paying attention, my mind might tell myself \u2018Well yes since its cheaper than buying just singles! That looks right.\u2019 But when actually looking back closely comparing those prices, most common sense seems telling oneself \u201cWow something ain\u2019t ok about that\u201d. Hence why checking again helped figure out what went wrong earlier; nothing else seemed amiss so either math skills needed polishing up\u2026or your eyesight getting better but let us continue explaining things further below :). Second issue found while reviewng prior attempts involved having trouble calculating percentages effectively \u2013 which could lead problems arising later due incorrect computation therefore resulting into false conclusions being made thus causing frustration etc..

Thus reducing overall expenditure significantly thus allowing further savings through efficient combination opportunities even though less common than full baskets still worth considering under conditions requiring flexibility beyond standard offer limitations imposed exclusively against bulk orders .

        " use this site if you need help understanding why we multiplied! I would really like it too since my teacher took forever going through all of these problems which take minimal effort online. That was horrible . :/ But here is another way using algebra....Algebraic Method Along similar lines as the above (and less intuitive) approach can go something along these lines...We let Y represent Terry\u2019s expenditure per month.$$Y=\\frac{d*p}{f}\\\\\\text {with } f\\text { being full boxes ($4$), p\\text{(price}) }\\$$ $$Y =\\frac{2(n)(3)}{4}$$ We know n=$30$ [since our interval isn\u2019t one box but rather half]And finally solve...After simplifying both sides $(2)(3)$ becomes just '$6'$. And because everything else except 'N'(number or months)??? Is equal ???? It leads us straight back again ! This only works when fractions work out nicely though ;) As shown below ;D Also note what happens depending upon whether N($x$) increases;<img>[459490_0] One might expect greater purchases means larger result ,but actually no ..it cuts down instead :) Just Fyi ... https://www.desmos.com/calculator Plugging random numbers into X results shows pretty reasonable patterns ^^^^ Anyway regardless of method used\u2026we find $$\\boxed{$Y=-15} $$ To sum up : Our first solution made sense conceptually while also following basic math rules \u2026the second \u201csolution\u201d didn\u2019t..this occurred mainly due to fractional issues making things unclear !! Although interesting nevertheless.....:)   Hopefully other users don \u2019 mho found helpful!! **Edit** Actually rechecked answers via calculators Both methods lead to same exact values however its always good practice doing your own calculations before reading official ones especially during exams :-) Happy Learning Always stay positive! &amp; keep practicing hard ??\u270c\ufe0f:-)",

It\u2019s important because if someone understand what problem describes \u2013 purchase price calculation based rate deals, this type of question might occur often while working as bookkeeper or budget managing person. This kind skill helps making decisions wisely when buying goods especially ones which come under promotions like \u201cbuy X quantity & save Y percent\u201d. Knowing basic mathematical principles allow quick calculations without using calculators tools thus being beneficial not only during work but also saving time otherwise wasted doing long computations manually!
