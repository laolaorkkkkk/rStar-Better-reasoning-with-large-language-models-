        " sauce contributes about 16 / (3*2)= 2.67 oz because it starts off as 16 oz but halves every time we make a new can so you get approximately twice as many smaller portions. Thus this equation becomes  2.67x=32 , solving which yields approx.  12 . Therefore Freda used around 12 times three equals thirty six or almost exactly ten packs worth forty eight individual tomatoes since one hundred twenty four divided up across twelve makes equal parts again implies that using three per original package was just under fifty percent efficient conversion rate wise meaning not all good raw materials converted evenly due either loss factors such heat during stewing process amongst others like water content dropping while freezing etc..

        " 16 ounces (each containing three tomatoes), we know that \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) would equal the amount of sauce produced because it retains only half of whatever went into them before cooking.

To solve our equation, first multiply both sides by 2; therefore,\\( x\\cdot16\\text{ oz}=64\\); next divide both side by 16; hence (\\(x =\\frac{64}{16}\\))and finally get \\(x = 4\\). This means Freda used four cans! Because every single pack contained exactly thee juicy red fruits which totals us to sixteen large ones as specified in question but not quite like what I expect you might want here, so let me rectify my mistake.\\nEach pack yields twenty times fewer fruit once processed owning to evaporation due heat effects causing shrinking/reduction among contents within storage units over time \u2013 resulting eventually upon consumption thereby reducing consumable portion sizes significantly .

Because what wasn\u2019t explicitly stated but also reasonably implied here is that everything stayed intact while boiling \u2013 no additional ingredients or additions alter the initial weight so X represents the same quantity beforehand. Thus, equating our derived formula against 32 allows solving; hence obtaining finally, around ((32)/((around)5.3))=approx.(~6)-thats means ~32/5 equals somewhere just under sixish approximations . Hence , considering only integral numbers because you cannot technically possess parts nor halves based quantities such instances like fruits etc...
