Since the dragon can breathe its flames up to 1000 feet away, it means even without any obstructions, standing inside this boundary would put them too close to danger (since their throwing range exceeds Dragons attack radius). To maximize safety yet maintain striking potential against Dragon, one might consider position slightly beyond the immediate threat zone but before maximum propulsion limit i.e., somewhere around halfway into effective Throw Range. This accounts both shielding oneself effectively whilst retaining offensive capability. Hence optimal safe spot considering balance would likely lie approximately between 'Dragon Flame Zone\u2019 & \u2018Maximum Propulsion Point'.

To determine the closest possible distance while keeping safe we take halfway point of their range difference i.e., (1200-1000) / 2 = 200/2=100 feet away maximum because if polly stood too close ,their projectiles might collide thus causing harm either way.<|end_of_document|>",

Therefore, assuming no external factors like wind or gravity affecting the throwing ability negatively (since these conditions aren't mentioned), Polly could safely position herself as close as 100 feet away but less than 200 feet from Mount Farbo's base before hitting the target regardless of whether she carries the sapphire gemstone or not.

Since the dragon reaches up to 1000 feet, adding those together we get 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet further out into space which is clear of the fiery attack. Thus if holding the gemstone, Polly may safely position herself as far away as (1000 +  200) feet or even closer without risking being burned alive while having enough time to come back inside again. Therefore our calculation shows us that standing exactly 1200 ft would ensure reaching beyond any danger zone whilst also maintaining escape routes all around; therefore such maximum safe stance equates precisely what was initially asked here \u2013 making choice E correct!",
        " Since the dragon's range is up to 1000 feet, if we subtract Polly's throwing power without the stone (400) from its maximum reach (1000), we get 1000 - 400 = 600. This means, standing just over halfway inside safe zone would allow shooting beyond but before touching Dragons limit; thus being able use full strength throws while outliness possible threats. However since increased effectiveness allowed even further shot due gems effects adding another hundred or so points makes area under threat effectively 'negligible'.

To ensure hitting the dragon while being safe, let's subtract half of the dragon's range (for maximum accuracy) which is 1000 / 2 = 500 feet. Therefore, standing outside of these remaining safe distances would put you underneath or too close to the limit; thus, even though theoretically one could aim further out but due to practicality stands safely around its effective non-combat area if inside the dragon\u2019s firing zone without risk\u2014we assume a buffer lesser than max extension capabilities over the normal limits.

Anywhere over 1000 feet away ensures no danger from the dragon's heat as long as you stay within the thrown range of the javelin which under normal conditions is up until approximately the midpoint \u2013 halfway through its flight path. Thus considering these factors together while ignoring unnecessary details like what happens if one throws too close; assuming optimal wind support & favorable weather -- We find the most dangerous spot lies right below our max launch radius \u2014 exactly at about 1000 ft . Beyond here risks falling short whereas beneath poses being burned alive!

Since even without any magical assistance, she couldn't yet match the Fire Breath Distance set forth previously i.e., exceeding mere hundred score marks of yards/meters away, hence considering all factors mentioned beforehand including safety boundaries placed around mighty creatures like Drake whose fangs might just snap shakily towards smaller entities attempting wilderness exploits \u2013 if asked directly about whether these extra booster stones provide useful gains against them ... yes indeed!

        " if she holds the gemstone, this distance triples which means it becomes 400*3=1200 feet. As the range of Dragon's Flames extends up till 1000 feet, any place beyond this would be safely out of its vicinity; even while wielding the enhanced power granted by the Sapphire Gemstone. Therefore, under these conditions Holden\u2019s position shouldn\u2019t affect whether or not Polly hits percival as long as positions considered safe (i.e., > 1000ft) remain unthreatened & accessible during flight timeframe \u2013 but keep track!

        " gemstone, it makes her able to throw further away than without; indeed exactly twice as often since 'three times farther'. This means the new possible range would become:  400 foot \u00d7 (double) \u2192 800 foot . Therefore , considering Perg flies over everything near him until a distance equal or greater than one thousand of its size ; so , if keeping possession of these precious stones ,Polly may remain safe while up to twenty percent shorter of that maximum extent , i.e., :   1 kilofoot \u2212 80%\u00d7one kilofoot=    200ft  Hence,the answer is : \\textbf{200 ft}. Indeed during this time interval our heroic girl throws all those weapons till ten hundred meters !!! I hope you find my analysis useful! Good luck in your quests ahead!. By using above mentioned algorithm I found out the following simple pattern matching logic:- Withou Gem : Max Reachable Distance :- X ==> max(X)*0.7+X<=1000=>Maximum Safe Range From Dragon Position := ~~One third less~~:=2/3*maxDistanceFromDragonsFourmsWhereEagleCanStillAttackInOrderToBeSafeWithoutGem======<i>=(TotalReachabilityRadius)-[(totalreachablityradius)]</lfi><li>(Final",
        " far, or 400 ft * 3 = <<400*3=1200>>1200 feet away. Thus, if Holding the Gemstone : Throw Distance :: X (Outside Dragon Flame range) : Y(Distance beyond Range), We get ->X/Y=1200/0 . Here, since it\u2019s infinite value due its division term being zero , therefore this implies even throwing upto infinity would always make us fall into dragons attack zone irrespective of whether we possess Sapphires or Not while assuming initial condition validity i.e Initial Javelin thrown without diamonds was under Dragons Attack Zone already; thus implying no positive safe Zones exist so ",

        " dragon hits away (which we call Range). Our formula becomes NewMaximumDistanceToDragon=(Total Damage \u2013Range) . Therefore if MaxHitDistance(dragon)=1000ft & DistanceFromWall(Poly)=X ft , your range would look like this-(NewMaximumDistanceToDragon)(Bonus)+CurrentDistance. We want all those values greater than zero because otherwise the math doesn\u2019t work out right\u2026 but what about negative numbers! Well just keep them as zeros since they mean nothing else :) . To get these new parameters onto one side without any fractions involved let us multiply everything across using multiplication rules instead : [(x^d)/c] => [a*(b/(cd))] -> ax+(bd)-(ac+bc). Since B&C equal their own max distances I simplify further down until i finally find my X which equals ((CD)*A)-((AD/CD)). Here AD represents Dragons Ability while AC stands alone pertaining exclusively towards Caitlyn herself even though its part inside something called \u2018the sum\u2018 itself.. Thus resulting directly below before being plotted thus concluding both equations equally satisfied alongwith having positive results themselves:- (CA_i)__|_(AC)_ |_<_(_DA_)|__(CB___)___(----------------------> Direction _______________   \u2026and voila!!!!! Your solution lies somewhere ahead awaiting discovery !.....\r",

Therefore, if we take half these values away (because you made both passes), our new damaged area becomes HalfTotalDamage which comes out to ((1/2)*1200) Which equals exactly six hundred miles per hour speed difference needed. We also see our remaining safe zone calculated according like such : SafeDistance= Difference-(HalfTargetValue)=(0)-(-300)->+300->which simplifies down nicely resulting again back onto simple math equations , thus ending up having successfully solved all problems stated above ! As always though please keep practicing till getting those answers perfect everytime .. Good luck!! :) ",
