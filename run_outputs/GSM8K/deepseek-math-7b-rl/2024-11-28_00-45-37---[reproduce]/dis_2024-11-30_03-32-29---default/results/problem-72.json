Therefore, Tommy raises $129 through the sale of brownies alone (we assume 'slice' refers here). To calculate the money earned from the sales of Cheesecake Pieces : We know Tommy earns $4 every time a slice/piece of cheesecake is purchased and since Tomas makes about ~23 cents profit off apple pie , it means that tomas spends around 2 centence(s) making one piece & considering other expenses such as tax etc . Henceforth our calculation would proceed thusly ;    Total revenue generated / Profit margin ratio      =>     [($4-$0.02)*$23]%            As you can see I used percentage value instead fractions because math formulas usually use % values! When computed accordingly my result becomes :-         [(4\u2013\u2300*$)23+\u00bd](\u223c0)+2\u21d2[\u2212\u00bc*$~0]+2$. Let me explain what happened earlier; when multiplying both sides together using distributive property rule (*\u22c5x\u2217y=\u00d7xy), all parts inside bracket needs attention too hence why am inserting extra variables into equation.. It might seem confusing but just follow along until conclusion arrives hopefully understanding increases throughout explanation... ",
        " calculate the amount raised from the sale of cheesecake. Cheesecakes are being sold at $4 per piece, which means, when Tommy sold them out all together (for tomorrow), he brought home $92 from it since he managed to sell only 23 cakes instead of what was planned yesterday! That makes up another chunk; hence we just add those amounts\u2014so altogether you can count yourself among successful people having made almost over four hundred bucks this season right off your baked good stockpile!!!

        " by step. Each brownie sold brings in $3 so if Tommy sells 43 brownies, he raises 3 * 43 = 129 dollars from them. Additionally, Tomas earns $4 per sale of Cheese cake which means he collectively raised 4 * 23 =  92 dollars. To find out exactly how much money was made altogether, we simply add up our previous amounts; thus ,the amount of funds collected equals : 129 dollar plus 92 dollar= 221 dollars . Thus tomas managed successfully to gather precisely (221) Dollars through these sales. Therefore, this result can also represent a sentence as follows:\"Tomas gathered around(approx.) twenty-two hundred one ($221$) USD\" or \"$\\boxed{221}$\".
