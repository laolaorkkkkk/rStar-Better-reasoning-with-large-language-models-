This reduction corresponds to multiplying their quantity by (1 \u2013 rate). It means every item decreases its amount not proportionately to itself \u2014 based rather on other items or averages being used as reference points when making measurements like scales weighting differences among groups differently than individual weights etc. First off though lets see which one went down less overall compared others(second vs fourth ). Third month saw fewer losses because despite increasing numbers , loss percentage remained constant unlike those before them who experienced smaller increases yet still greater drops per dollar spent due higher costs involved during previous rounds .

This means we get only those who downloaded less than others equaling or greater amounts. That\u2019s why such calculation becomes : [60+180] -|(the absolute value)|[54]=240 \u2013 |(-54)|=240\u201354=186.
