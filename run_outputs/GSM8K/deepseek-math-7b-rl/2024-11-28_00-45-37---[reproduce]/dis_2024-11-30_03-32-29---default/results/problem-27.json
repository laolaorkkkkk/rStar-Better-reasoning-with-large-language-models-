What was your thought process when first encountering such problems involving quantities or measures used repeatedly over time like \u201cserves\u201d, liters etc. ? First read all instructions very carefully; pay attention particularly not only **to** which quantity/unit describes just __one__ portion but also note whether it tells us about single use / consumption _or_ multiple uses / consumptions using other phrases expressly telling so ! Second notice terms related both mathematically and contextually i.e. things actually measured through specific tools as well ; see below explanation : ***A liter measure*** indicates volume whereas ---->(a)--- ``just a'' serve cannot represent either fractional part nor full units hence its magnitude becomes important while considering any operation & calculation !! This term simply serves our purpose therefore without ambiguity -- however I could argue against usage since unlike others (**which require special equipment mentioned above along with explicit unit description') served amount may vary drastically ... As pointed out before, word choice indeed matters greatly especially during mathematic problem solving exercises whenever possible .. When dealing w/ measurement based tasks even slightest misinterpretation leads up into wrong deductions affecting accuracy dramatically .
