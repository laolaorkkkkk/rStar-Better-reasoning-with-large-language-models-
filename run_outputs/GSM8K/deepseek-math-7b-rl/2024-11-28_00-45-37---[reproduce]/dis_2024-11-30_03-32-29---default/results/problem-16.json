But individually if needed, based solely off its own path/travel log without comparing interchanges... It went back south again presumably overnight before getting up & heading northeast early morning thereby achieving net movement roughly approximating arctan(distance /time) assuming negligible loss against friction due atmospheric conditions w/ wind speed impact etc.). Adding those lateral distancing values doesn\u2019t change anything because whatever value came out was already factored into initial setup phase calculating distances within itself respectively according our standard Euclidean geometry rules applied typically unless otherwise stated differently somewhere else explicitly mentioned elsewhere..

Analogously applies reversely too! To prevent confusion here lets rephrase query explicitly : Overall route traversed remains uniform across all trains irrespective though segments differ amongst them ; collectively shared length stands constant no matter division taken whether linear or split thereby equalling out evenly among separate tracks.. Simplified directly implies ,both trains traverse equal overall span daily totals remain untouched despite different paths /routes undertaken thus neither gets ahead nor falls behind .

Displacement forms right triangle having legs equal to distances moved earlier \u2013 one vertically upwards(north) & other horizontally towards west , i.e., lengths equal respective side measurements respectively : so this means our perpendicular line or hypotenuse length becomes sqrt((North)^2+(West)^2).
