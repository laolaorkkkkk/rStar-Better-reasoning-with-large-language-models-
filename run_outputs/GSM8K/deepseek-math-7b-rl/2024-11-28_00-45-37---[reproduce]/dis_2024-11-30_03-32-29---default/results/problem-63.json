As mentioned before, the period considered here as 'second half' also lasts another 6 months i.e., again spans across 6 months . Hence , these six months equate to $126/month * 6 months = $<<126*6=756>>756 spent over those same duration. Combining both amounts spent throughout all twelve months leads us to a cumulative expenditure of just under $$1596(which results directly when adding previous quantities calculated separately) which constitutes the whole financial contribution made towards maintaining subscription services rendered within said timespan[i.e.]([$840+$756]=-)[this mathematical equation being applicable solely upon application or use]).

Thus every month during the last half of the year she pays only around $126 . Multiplying this price by another 6 equals 6 * $126 = $756 , reflective of what she needs to pay for those remaining months of her contract period.
