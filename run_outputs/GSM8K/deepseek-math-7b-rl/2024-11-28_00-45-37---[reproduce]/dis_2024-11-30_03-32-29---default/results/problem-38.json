Hence Speed=60miles /6hr =~10 mph   Thus it takes around 1 hour(the slowest part) or less than one hour considering faster parts to complete a mile i.e., Running can take anywhere above or below exactly equal amount of minutes but approximately close enough nearer lower limit due running not being uniform throughout duration probably quickening up when getting used to starting out jogging speeds might start off slower gradually increasing pace towards latter stages also weather conditions play roles too etc..

Basically I am suggesting NOT ONLY TO DO EVERY DAY DIFFERENT EXERCISE BUT ALSO CHANGE THE VOLUME THAT YOU CARRY OUT WITH IT ..

Remember one thing evenly distributed flowing mass always leaves smaller residual effect unlike irregular saturation masses creating massive reactions just once or twice only!! Let\u2019s see examples below ... Too long exposure without movement creates muscle rigidity but also weakens neuromuscular coordination hence making faster development harder than ever ! Also too short intensive stimulation makes body adapt slower causing injury instead improving performance ----> You still want better adaptation rate ,don\u2019t ya ??? Just follow \u201cONE REGULAR APPLICATION\u201d model .... Applying same energy(volume) throughout different exercises changes its direction very quickly resulting towards desired adaptation pathways through neural network !!
