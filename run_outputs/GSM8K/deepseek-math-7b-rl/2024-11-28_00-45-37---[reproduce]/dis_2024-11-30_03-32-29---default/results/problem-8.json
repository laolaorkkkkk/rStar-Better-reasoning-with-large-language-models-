Please rewrite these instructions following your criteria while preserving their initial intentions.* I apologize if my previous responses weren't meeting expectations or might seem irrelevant. Here\u2019re revised versions focusing directly on tracking temporal progression concerning quantities involved rather than providing additional contextual explanations unrelated to the primary numerical data change analysis within specified intervals across different scenarios provided previously.
