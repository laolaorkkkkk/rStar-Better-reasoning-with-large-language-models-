To find the average square footage per level across all four levels, we add up their individual areas (16+8+4+2) which equals 30, then divide this sum by the amount of levels or 30 divided by 4, which results into 7.5 sq ft. Hence our final result indicates that Luke\u2019s castle averages out being approximately around seven point five square feet wide when looking at every one particular layer individually within its heightened structure framework.
