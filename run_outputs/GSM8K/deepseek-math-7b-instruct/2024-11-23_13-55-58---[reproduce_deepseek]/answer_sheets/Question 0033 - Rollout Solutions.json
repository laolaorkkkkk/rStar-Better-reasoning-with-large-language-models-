Then G (gold) equals S+30(silver plus thirty). We also know from our problem statement information above that she holds either 170 or 110coins dependingon whether those additional 30were all Goldor if they were split between Goldand Silver Coinsrespectively.. Thus since both equations equal 110 ,we can say X+(X+3)=Y where Y represents any one variety mentioned hereabove ;therefore makingour final equation : y=y\u2019*(x)+(z)*((x)+B)-A\u2026where B=-C,-D", "subanswer": {"text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x, which represents the number of silver coins.", "value": 0.8}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can set up an equation:", "subanswer": {"text": "Number of gold coins = Number of silver coins + 30", "value": 0.8}, "ost_step": {"1": "Let S represent the number of silver coins. Then G=S+30 represents the number of gold coins. We know these two quantities add up to the total quantity so we can write this as our first equation; i.e., S+(S+30)=110 or equivalently 2*S+30=110. Solving for one variable at a time, starting with isolating 2_S on LHS, we get 2_S=110\u221230\u22342_S=80 Finally solving for S we divide both sides by 2 obtaining S=80/2 giving us S=40 . Since she also knows G=(this new value)+30 then it follows immediately that Gold Coins(GC)=40 Silver Coins +(Silver Coins)+(30)=(Total Coins).
