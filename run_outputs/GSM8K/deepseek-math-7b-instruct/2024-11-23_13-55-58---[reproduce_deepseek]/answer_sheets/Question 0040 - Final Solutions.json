Similarly , if you wish instead multiply their ages themselves without factoring first separately --i like doing separate factors because those represent terms people can relate better sometimes but either way works!.So again Bennys would turn into : Ab =(S)'s #of years x factor vs S ----->Ab=(1yr.)*(2yrs./yr.)----equal sign-- ? yrs..you get same result faster using just straight unit conversion ratio method above !
