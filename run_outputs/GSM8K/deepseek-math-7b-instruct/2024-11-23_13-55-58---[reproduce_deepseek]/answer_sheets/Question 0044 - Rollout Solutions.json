We know that one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10. Since this amount covers both the beeswax and the wicks, it means these ingredients combine to form enough wax to make 10 candles at a time because you get 10 candles worth of product per dollar spent on materials when your marginal cost structure stays constant across all units produced or sold like it does here. This doesn't change regardless of whether he only uses $.5/candle * 20= $<<$.5*20=10>>10 worth of material for 20 individual items versus using $1.00 /per set(or group)of ten unit operations run at once which would require twice as much money thrown into operation but still yields same outcome since MC remains stable over entire production quantity range assumed here...in other words no matter what path taken just keep marginal cost flat then simply multiply price per item times quantity made equals Total Revenue!
