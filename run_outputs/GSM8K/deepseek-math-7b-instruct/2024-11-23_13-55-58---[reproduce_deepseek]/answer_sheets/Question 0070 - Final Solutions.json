To start off right away let us figure first all those weekday sessions since these present themselves without fail during weekends as well! Monday through Friday account just shy or over half our desired calculation so I suggest breaking this down into steps based upon quantity rather than trying something overly complex at once; otherwise one could get lost along road traveled getting nowhere fast due solely bad math skills showing its ugly head here instead helping solve situation involving unknown variable amount collected via ticket sales etc\u2026For starters looking simply Mondays & Tuesdays combined versus rest days separately seems reasonable enough approach considering similar overall totals generated either way but simpler adding both sets directly afterwards especially when dealing lesser amounts would suffice whilst maintaining accuracy achieved thereby leading quickly towards ultimate solution nicely indeed !
