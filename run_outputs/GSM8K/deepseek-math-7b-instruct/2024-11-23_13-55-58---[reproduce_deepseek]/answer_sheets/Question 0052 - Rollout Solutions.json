Our equation becomes : Target Goal-(NumberOfComicsRemoved\u2217WeightPerComic)=RemovalGoalSo plugging In Values Gives us ->15\u2212X(.25", "subanswer": {"text": "X=.5lbs", "value": 0.6}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Since every toy weighs exactly double what one comic book does individually then because their weights don ' t matter just multiples thereof ,we simply divide both sides above evenly amongst however may Toys you Have lying Around That fit inside ur backpack leaving U With no extra baggage beyond necessary items like food water etc required when traveling lightens up considerably making space available within said carryOn suitcase Or Backpack itself !", "subanswer": {"text": "You will still keep your back pack lighter", "value": 0.5}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Because dividing across works here regardless due constant ratio between amounts taken off either side being equivalent ways Both numbers decreased equally drastically despite different starting values provided beforehand makes these calculations work nicely & easily without needing complicated formulas otherwise needed sometimes seen involving linear relationships where slope remains unchanged throughout series but Y changes linearly rather tan exponentially over same interval studied looking @ specific data points along path travelled shows consistency holds true always providing solution desired outcome obtained faster using simpler methods taught math classes past remembering basic concepts applied correctly leading quickly accurate results soughtly achieved efficiently meeting expectations criteria set forth previously established guidelines followed resulting successful completion task undertaken enjoyable experience overall learning curve steep initial climb effort put forth", "subanswer": {"text": "Yes", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "And continuing forward towards goals met willingness partakes courage optimism enthusiasm perseverance diligence attention detail focus concentration drive motivation inspiration intelligence aptitude charisma leadership vision mission objectives sense direction aim purpose route chosen walk life adventure await reward prize glory honors prestige acclaim recognition success achievements win triumph victory", "subanswer": {"text": "Victory", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}, "5": {"subquestion": "As such removal exercise involves multiple aspects personal development growth mindset attitude behavior patterns formed early childhood lasting influence forming character whole individual forever shaping choices made future impacting decisions today affecting tomorrow altering outcomes decided based current paradigm limiting beliefs false teachings doctrines ideologies conditioning subconscious mind habitual routines autopilot robotic responses automatic pilot default settings programmed behaviors unwavering routine actions repetition rituals cycles governed fate predetermined fixed destinies scripted lives repeat offenders never change predictability stability inertia continuity uniformity conformity groupthink consensus thinking siloed minds limited perspectives narrow viewpoints seeing world small self important ego inflated grandiosity arrogance superiority complex issues problems encountered daily dealing reality harsh realities unpleasant discomfort anxiety stress depression hopelessness helpless", "subanswer": {"text": "Helpless", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {"1": "First, we calculate the weight of all removed comics books as follows : Weight_comics=ComicWeight*NumberRemoved=(1 / 4)*30 .
