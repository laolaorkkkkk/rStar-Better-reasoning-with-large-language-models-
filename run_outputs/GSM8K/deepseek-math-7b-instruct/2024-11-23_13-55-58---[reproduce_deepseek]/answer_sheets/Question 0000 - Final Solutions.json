We know that she eats 3 eggs for breakfast, bakes 4 muffins (which use 2 eggs), and sells 10 eggs at the farmers' market. Therefore, the total number of eggs used or sold is 3 (for breakfast) + 2 (for muffins) + 10 (sold at the farmers' market) = 15 eggs.\n\nSubtracting this from the total number of eggs laid each day gives us the number of eggs kept: 16 (total eggs) - 15 (eggs used/sold) = 1 egg.\n\nSince Janet sells all these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, her daily earnings can be calculated as follows: Total price = Price per egg \u00d7 Number of eggs. Substituting values into the equation gives: Total price = $2 \u00d7 1 egg = $2.\n\nSo, Janet makes $\\boxed{2}$ dollars every day at the farmers' market.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
