We know she runs three times as fast as she walks, so we denote her walking speed as $x$ and obtain the following ratios: Run : Walk : Skip := 3 : 1 : 1. To find how much she walks and runs, notice the sum of the parts must equal six hours; thus, each part represents $\\frac{6}{(3+1+1)}=\\frac{6}5.$ Thus, letting the variable $h$ represent one unit of time, we calculate Running = (3) * (hours running/unit)*(speed running) = $(3)(\\frac{6}{5})(6)$ Walking = (1) * (hours walking/unit)*(speed walking) = $(1)(\\frac{6}{5})(3)$.
