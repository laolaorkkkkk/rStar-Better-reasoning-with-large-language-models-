This will be done by dividing distance covered by number of equal parts i.e., when you divide round trips or halves etc.. In other words , do not forget about rounding decimals! You then subtract out all known distances from your calculated midpoint value e.g.: Total Distance => D=7km; Stop #l=> .2D=.2(x)=> x km ;Stop#n=>(.Y)NKM Resting Point => R=(X+y)-ZKMs !END", "subanswer": {"text": "To find mid point simply take average ie.(start &end points ) hence avg =(lower limit [here its zero]+(upperlimit[ here upperlimiis taken 'cause its mentioned close tourstops )) divided bv lwo ..in simple way say u r travelling wid ur vehicle frm home tsrur hotel located @some middle n go back again wif same path...so measure distnce btwn entrance gate o{hotel nd last pt visited inside ground....then add bothdistnces get final ans", "value": 0.6}, "ost_step": {"1": "Henry started biking at mile marker 0 on his journey.", "2": "After traveling for about half an hour or so when he reached around the halfway point it would feel like stopping because you\u2019ve traveled only covered one fifth percent distance towards your goal destination leaving plenty time till completion as well making sure not skip this checkpoint then continue until next rest area/point also known simply put midpoint OR midway through anything means dividing said thing into equal halves . This could mean physical things but can apply metaphorically speaking too i guess depending upon context used! For example let s say we talk abt painting picture here Mid Point might actually represent exact center Of our design regardless what form those lines came In whether straight curved etc..etc... Moving further ahead\u2026It took him another five hours later arriving again somewhere along these paths crossing multiple roads coming across various landmarks including historical spots worth noting , seeing local attractions nearby taking photos all while getting warm sunrays kisses rain drops splashing against windows wipers blaring horns honking motorcycles flying kites high above blue skies clouds whizzing past window blinds fluttering wildly adding spice fun filled adventure !!
