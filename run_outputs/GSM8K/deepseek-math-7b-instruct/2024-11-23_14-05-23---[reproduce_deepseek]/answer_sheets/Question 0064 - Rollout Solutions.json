You get about two liters consumed over each kilometer travelled thusly computed ((Litres/Kms)=km\u2212\u00b9). This means driving consumes fuel at twice its speed than riding does because half goes into accelerating itself forward whilst remaining other half helps maintain current velocity level without further effort applied whatsoever until next burst occurs later down line during deceleration phase returning us back towards equilibrium state described above i term 'metabolic homeostasis'...hence why most advanced machines strive hard stay within certain performance ranges rather gamble wildly outside boundaries set beforehand due lack thereof understanding fundamentals instead opting simpler rules guiding behavior such norms exist here courtesy complexity involved interactions among parts making whole system behave differently resultant manner compared individual components acting alone individually isolated environment doesn\u2018t allow anyone escape consequences blindly following instincts habitually leading astray victims unaware world wonkish paradigm driven mindsets obliviousness blindness missing crucial cues signals warning lights flashing red flagging dangers imminent unless heed", "2": "Next calculate potential range achievable before needing another refill stop either via planning accordingly allowing time extra just incase versus hoping against likelihood running low supplies unexpectedly resulting inconvenience interruption journey hence better safe guard proactive approach bear necessities provision along route ahead off course altogether ignoring previous advice wisdom ignore lessons learned past hurts mistakes cost dear repeated history repeat cycle death spiral slowly descending pit unwittingly tumbling never halting spinning round forever doomed whirlpool void black hole no return path exists only oblivion await forlorn future beckons waiting patiently enduring suffering torment misery unrelenting agony torture merciless cruelty cruel unkind heartless uncaring callous disregard contempt scorn ridicule derision mockery taunt mock humiliate defame degrade belittle trivialize laugh scoff snicker sneer mock mocks teases teasing ridicules jokingly joking ribbing roasting scorning slanders calumny slander smear character tarnish damage reputations harm damages destroy utterly obliterates wipe clean wiped away nada nothing lost gone erased effaced blank slate anew afresh start new beginning restart reboot reprogrammed recoded reconfigured redesigned remade reshaped revamped reinvented reparated repaired restored revitalized revived reborn brand spanking new born pure fresh pristine spotless virginity chastity hymen intact undamaged unscathed untouched wholesome good sound healthy fit well balanced poised steady stable secure contented happy joyful", "3": "Finally determine distance able cover empty tank travel burn through entirety contents leaving none reserve leftover surplus unused excess extras superfluous not necessary waste discard trash junk throwaway garbage rubbish ruin irredeemable loss irreversible broken busted kaput destroyed beyond saving salvaging redeeming salvage repairing restoring rejuvenating revive reconstruct resuscitate save rescue recover restore resurrect resurrect revival resurrection lifesaving life savers rescuers helpers aids auxiliaries assistants support squad team crew group gang pack mob horde crowd gathering assembly throng multitude millions billions trillions etc\u2026 all coming toward goal same destination target aim purpose mission objective end desired goals aims purposes missions objectives ends desires targets aimed directed pointed headed steered guided navigated courses paths routes directions ways methods procedures protocols strategies plans schemes systems operations processes workflows workflavors works flavors workflow flowchart chart diagram blueprint plan design engineer architect conceptualizer conception thinker planner designer builder developer constructor constructer constructionist constructing con"}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas.
