We also want to find out how much more revenue was made on the day with higher revenue.\n\nOn Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. Therefore, the revenue made on Thursday can be calculated as follows:\nRevenue_Thursday = (Number of truck tires * Cost per truck tire) + (Number of car tires * Cost per car tire)\n= (6 * $60) + (4 * $40)\n= $360 + $160\n= $520\n\nOn Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires and repaired 12 car tires at $40 each. Therefore, the revenue made on Friday can be calculated as follows:\nRevenue_Friday = Number of car tires * Cost per car tire\n= 12 * $40\n= $480\n\nNow let's compare the revenues made on both days:\nDifference = Revenue_Thursday - Revenue_Friday\n= $520 - $480\n= $40\n\nSo, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
