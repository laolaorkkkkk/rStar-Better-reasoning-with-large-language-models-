To calculate what amount does Janets needs to ensure safe keeping we divide our original cost ($1300), therefore ,$1300*0/1=($130)...we only take zero because percentage cant equal nothingness but can approach so close! And if you don't understand why I said 'divide', well thats simple logic really...if something costs fifteen dollars on average over time due mostly large purchases made periodically versus small ones like toothbrushes etc.,then obviously those single items would appear insignificant compared towards these big ticket projects right?...so yeah math makes sense :)"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First find out all expense which includes both initial price payment (material+construction)and additional charges ie.(insurance fee)=total expenses=(initial expences)+(additional charge)=(Rs.[[email\u00a0protected]]+([[email protected]%([[@][@] )[= Rs [@@]+rs [[Email protected])", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.
