You use multiplication here since every single day involves similar operations being performed resulting into homogenous products or same kind of things say chairs ,tables..etc sold at constant price ..so multiply quantity bought(chairs )times cost($).And similarly we get totals when several quantities added all amounting to only oncesum i guess...for example if two tables @200$,one chair@100$and so forth add them up giving your total bill=$N*.In layman terms its easier said than done mathematically but simple logic applied well helps make it clear cut mathematical proposition.Also division comes handy specially sharing cookies & candies etc fairly among children preserving love&peace! Same goes with subtraction involving removal /loss elimination ...like apple eaten away!!"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out Jane's yearly earning first take product (multiple)of both Earnings Per Week And Weeks Worked which can also be written : Weekly Rate \u00d7 Total Hours Worked During A Year =(Hourly Wage\u00d7Hours)/Week\u2217Total Weeks\nSubstituting the values: Hourly Wage Of Teacher X Teaching Days IN A YEAR+ Hourly wague OF Coach*coaching days ina year Gives us", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.

She teaches for 35 hours per week, so over 50 weeks, she teaches for a total of 35 hours/week * 50 weeks = 1750 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings from teaching would be 1750 hours * $20/hour = $35,000.\n\nNext, let's calculate Jill's earnings as a cheerleading coach. She coaches for 15 hours per week, so over 50 weeks, she coaches for a total of 15 hours/week * 50 weeks = 750 hours. Since she earns $30 per hour, her total earnings from coaching would be 750 hours * $30/hour = $22,500.\n\nFinally, adding these two amounts together, Jill's total annual salary would be $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
