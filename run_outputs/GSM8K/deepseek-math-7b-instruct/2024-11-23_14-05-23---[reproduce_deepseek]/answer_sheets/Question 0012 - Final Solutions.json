To make sure you earn something within those first few months/years too, I would say round up the nearest whole year since nobody wants to work with fractions here. For instance if your break-even comes to around twelve and three quarters then don't forget about those extra three months because during these particular period(s), you weren't making quite enough off what came out but still lost due tu fixed monthly bills etc.. In other words plan ahead & prepare financially speaking otherwise such scenarios could spell trouble down road later .So therefore according to my calculations mentioned aboveincludingallcontagion srelatedto potencialdela ysthelemon treewouldtakehimaboutoneandthreequartersyearstoearnbackitsofihundreddollarinvestmentinitialcostpr iceofnine", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Carlos is planting a lemon tree.
