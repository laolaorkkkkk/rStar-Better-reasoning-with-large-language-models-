Instead just keep reading below .. so let X represent one single box ; then according tot he information provided above : Total Weight <= max allowed capacity(bridge weight limitation). That means Driver+TruckWgt+(Box*X)<=MaxBridgeCapacity; Solve equation i n order get MAXIMUM #of Boxes possible => Max#Of_boxes=(maxcapacity-(driverweight)+(truckwt))/singleboxwtdensity OR In simpler words , take away both drivers & trucks static weight THEN Divide Remaining amount By Each Box weighs .
