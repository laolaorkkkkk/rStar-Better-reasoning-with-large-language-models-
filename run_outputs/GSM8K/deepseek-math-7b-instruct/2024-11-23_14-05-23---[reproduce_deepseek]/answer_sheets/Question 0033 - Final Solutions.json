This gives us Equation 1: `g = s + 30`.\n\nWe also know that the total number of coins, which is the sum of the number of silver coins and gold coins, equals 110. Therefore, we obtain Equation 2: `s + g = 110`.\n\nNow, substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2 to eliminate 's': `s + (s + 30) = 110`, simplifying further results in `2s + 30 = 110`. Subtract 30 from both sides leads to `2s = 80` and finally, divide through by 2 implies `s = 40`. By substitution back into Equation 1, we infer that `g = 40 + 30 = 70`.

We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins can be represented as (x+30).\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nNumber of silver coins + Number of gold coins = Total number of coins\nx + (x+30) = 110\nLet's simplify and solve for x:\n2x + 30 = 110\nTo isolate x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:\n2x + 30 - 30 = 110 - 30\n2x = 80\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\nx = 80 / 2\nx = 40\nTherefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and (40+30)=70 gold coins.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Gretchen has 110 coins.
