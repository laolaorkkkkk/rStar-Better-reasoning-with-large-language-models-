Since every student comes with both a boy or girl designation (and not just any gender but specifically either), you add together males+females=students . Specifically then , since they send five athletes per sport  \u2014boys*girls=(boysperschool)+(girlsperschool)=(schoolteamsofathletes) =(boysperschool)+(girlsperschool)=(schoolteamsofathletes).
