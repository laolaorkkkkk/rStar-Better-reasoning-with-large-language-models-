In general ,the term 'equation' refers to a mathematical statement which equates two algebraic expressions . It consists of two sides , LHS ( Left Hand Side ) and RHS ( Right Hand Side ) connected by an equal sign (=) For example :- A simple equation can be 2x+1=7 Here, 2x+1 is the LHS and 7 is the RHS An equation is like a weighing balance . Both the sides are balanced by an equal (=) sign whereas an inequality involves the symbols greater than (>), less than (<) or equal to (\u2265) Inequalities come in handy while dealing with scenarios involving range of values rather than a single point .
