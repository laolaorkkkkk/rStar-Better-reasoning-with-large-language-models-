Therefore, the sum of teams and coaches would be: 40 (players) + 8 (coaches) = 48. The final total answer is: 48 players.",

Multiply the number of schools by the individual participants to find the total: For example, this school sent: 20 people + 4 coaches + 2 coaches + 8 coaches (since each team needs a coach and there are two teams per school) Therefore, the total would be (total number of schools)(total number of people): 4 x 28 = 112. 4 x 28 equals 112.
