Therefore, running speed = 2 x 3 miles/hour = 6 miles/hour. Since she skips at twice her walking speed, we know her walking speed is 1 mile/hour. Identify the distances traveled when Dana runs and walks. If Dana spends one-third of her total time running, then her time running is 1/3 of the total time (6 hours), so she runs for \\(\\frac{6}{3} = 2\\) hours.
