        " 2 years old and is two times older than Suzy's, Suzy's iPhone must be 1 year old. Finally, checking our logic using this information. If Ben's iPhone is 2 years old and Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, the calculation should tell us that the difference of time between them matches up. Final answer therefore needs to be checked. The correct answer then logically should verify here itself as correct. Final answer therefore: \\( \\boxed{4} \\).",
        " Suzy's iPhone. We also know that Suzy\u2019s iPhone is 1 year old. From this, we can say that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old because he's twice as old as Suzy's. And because Brandon's iPhone is four times the age of Ben's, we simply multiply 2 * 4. So, our final equation is: 2 * 4, which equals to 8.",
