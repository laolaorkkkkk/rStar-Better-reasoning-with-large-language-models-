        ": Overtime pay is calculated as follows: 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Therefore her overtime rate (for any time over 40) is 10 * 1.2 = 12 dollars per hour. Eliza has worked 45 hours this week. Subtracting her 40-hour regular hours from those hours leaves us with 5 hours of overtime work. Thus, her income from just the overtime hours is: 12 * 5 = 60 dollars. Add this to her regular hourly rate to find the total earnings from the 45 hours. The final amount earned in one week is: 400 dollars plus 60 dollars = 460 dollars. This would be the sum of what Eliza earns during her regular shift and her additional hours worked at an increased pay rate. The answer is: 460.",

        " 1.2 * $10, which equals $12 per hour. Determine the number of overtime hours Eliza worked during the week. Calculate the sum of regular hours and overtime hours (40 + 5 = 45). Find out how much Eliza earns for the hours she worked overtime: $12 * 5 = 60 dollars. Add up both amounts ($120 + $40 = $50) to determine Eliza's total weekly earnings. Therefore, Eliza made $500 in the 45-hour workweek. The correct answer is: 500"
