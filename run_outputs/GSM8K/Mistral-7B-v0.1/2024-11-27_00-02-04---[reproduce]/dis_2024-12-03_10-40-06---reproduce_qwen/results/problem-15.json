        " $96 (because the market rises by 1.2%). The profit here is calculated using percentage gain. Comparatively, if he buys jewelry, the rise will only be $5,000 * 2.5% = $125. Since the mathematical calculations show that $125 > $96, we need to look at the question carefully. If the goal was to minimize cost while maximizing growth rate, buying jewelry is better off; else, buying\u7535\u5b50 games maximizes profit based on given percentages. However, since no such question asks to compare, let\u2019s stick to finding out the net profit. We calculate both values directly as it\u2019s already provided in the formula of profit increase given the current market values. The greater value from them will shape our answer. So we choose the profit value of electronic gadgets as the higher side of calculation. Hence, your final answer should reflect the maximum profit scenario where you buy the electronic gadgets which gives $96 profit. The answer is: $96. \\boxed{96}",

To find out which option maximizes the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the potential increase for both choices. Since we are not given any other information such as initial costs, we can compare the absolute increases directly. For jewelry, the increase is $5,000 * 2.5% = $125. For electronic gadgets, the increase is $8,000 * 1.2% = $96. Hence, the greater profit comes from choosing to buy the jewelry because the growth rate results in a higher profit increase. Thus, if he chooses the jewelry purchase plan, his profit increase will be \\boxed{125}. The key lies in calculating these increases correctly and then comparing them, considering the growth rates specified in the question. This approach allows us to determine the optimal purchase decision. ",
