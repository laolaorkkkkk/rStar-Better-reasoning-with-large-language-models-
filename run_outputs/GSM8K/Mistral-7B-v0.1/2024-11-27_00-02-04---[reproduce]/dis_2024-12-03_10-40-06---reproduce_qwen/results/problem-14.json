The first part of the problem tells us there were 8 teams in the tournament and each team played against every other team exactly once. This means we need to find out the number of combinations of 8 teams taken 2 at a time. This is calculated using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of teams, \\( k \\) is the number of teams playing in each game, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial. Plugging in the values, we get \\( \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2!6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\).
