The interest per phone per month is calculated as follows: Interest per phone per year = \\$150 x 2/100 = \\$3; Therefore, interest per month on one phone is \\$3 / 12 = \\$0.25; Total interest per month for five phones is 5 x \\$0.25 = \\$1.25 Hence, the total amount paid per month for all five phones combined, including interest, amounts to \\$50 + \\$1.25 = \\$51.25. To find the monthly payment over three months, we divide the total cost by three, which equals \\$51.25 x 3 = \\$153.75 divided by three, i.e., \\$153.75 / 3. The cost per phone can also be determined directly as \\$150 plus the \\$1.25 interest, i.e., \\$151.25 per phone. Multiply this price by the 5 phones, yielding \\$151.25 x 5 = \\$756.25.
