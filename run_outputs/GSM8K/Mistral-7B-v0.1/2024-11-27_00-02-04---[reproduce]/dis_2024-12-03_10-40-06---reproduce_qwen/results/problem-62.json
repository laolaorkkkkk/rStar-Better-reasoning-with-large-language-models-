It is mentioned that she receives the pension starting after 20 years and continues to receive it until she is eligible for the 5% pension option. If she starts receiving the pension at age 20 and does not change position until age 30, we can calculate the additional pension after 30 years. We need to consider whether her annual pension is based purely on years worked or if there's any other element. However, since the problem indicates it's purely on years worked, we have a more straightforward method. From age 20 to 30, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000, so no additional pension is mentioned for years after 30. The answer should take into account the initial age progression but not additional pension changes. For clarity, let's assume an annual pension of $50k for all years after 20, as no specific changes were\u63d0\u5230 post age 30. This is a simplification based on typical scenarios, resulting in a constant $50,000/year pension.",

        " But she works for 30 years, which means she doesn't reach age 20.
