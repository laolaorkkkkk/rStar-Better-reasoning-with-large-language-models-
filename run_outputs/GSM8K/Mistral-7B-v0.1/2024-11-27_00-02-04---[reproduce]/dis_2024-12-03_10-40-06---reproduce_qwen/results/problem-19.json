        " so far was $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$ miles per hour. Since Marissa wants her average speed for the entire hike to be 4 miles per hour and she still needs to cover 12 - 6 = 6 more miles, we need to determine the required speed to make up for this remaining work. Since she has a goal of 4 miles per hour for the whole hike, let's calculate the remaining time she has. The total duration required to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$ hours. Because Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking so far, there is only $3 - 2 = 1$ more hour to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles. Therefore, she needs to walk 6 miles in 1 hour which translates to a required speed of 6 miles per hour. Let\u2019s write down our conclusion explicitly: ",

Determine the total time Marissa would have spent on the trail if she wanted an average speed of 4 miles per hour. We know she walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which means her average speed so far was 3 miles per hour. To make sure she walks at an average of 4 miles per hour overall, we use the formula for average speed: total distance / total time = average speed. Let \\( t \\) represent the additional time needed to complete the remaining 6 miles. Then, her total average speed equation is:",
        " achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trip, calculate the total required time for the hike. Total distance is 12 miles, and she wants to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the total time needed is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours. So, subtracting the time she already spent from her planned total time, the remaining time she needs is 3 hours - 2 hours (time already spent) = 1 hour. Use the formula for speed to find out how fast Marissa needs to walk in the last hour to achieve this average speed: Distance leftover divided by remaining time equals needed speed (6 miles / 1 hour). So, she needs to walk at a speed of \\boxed{6} miles per hour for the remaining part of the trail. This way she will achieve the desired average speed of 4 miles per hour.\\\\",
        " 2 miles, so again, the speed is 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour. So she has walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. That leaves her 12 - 6 = 6 miles left. For average speed to be 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, we solve for time: total distance = average speed x total time => 12 = 4 x total time => total time = 12 / 4 => total time = 3 hours. 6 miles left, so time needed = 3 - 2 = 1 hour. Speed needed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. The answer is: 6.",

Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we know she needs to make sure the time taken to walk all 12 miles equals (12 miles divided by 4 miles per hour). This means she needs the total time to be 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours. Therefore, if she already spent 2 hours, she needs (3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour to complete the last part of the trail).
