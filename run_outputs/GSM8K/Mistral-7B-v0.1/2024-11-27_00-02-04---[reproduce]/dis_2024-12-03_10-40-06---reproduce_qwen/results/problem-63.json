The problem specifies 10 percent less for the next six months; let's find out how much that is, subtracting 10 percent from 756, which yields 679.8 dollars, rounded to 680 dollars for the second half of the year (as it's not typically calculated with decimals until higher precision levels). Add up both halves, and you get 679.8 plus 840 dollars, making your final figure 1519.8. Since the question only asks for an integer result, round this to the nearest dollar.",

Compute how much she spends during these 6 months. As above, you multiply the \\$126 by 6. Calculate the sum by applying the rates appropriately: \\((140 \\times 6) + (126 \\times 6)\\).
