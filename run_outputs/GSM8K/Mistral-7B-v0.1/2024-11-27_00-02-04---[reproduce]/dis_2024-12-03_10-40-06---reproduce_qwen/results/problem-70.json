Now let's count the numbers of students attending all those classes: 75 students during the weekday classes, plus 15 additional students from her hourly rate, which comes out to: 33(weekdays and Saturday classes) times 15(conditions), equals 33*15. To work through this further, we need to solve 33*15 using repeated addition. Each hour represents 15 students. So 15+15+15, etc. Since you need help I will continue the next line. Since there are three 15s added together, it amounts to: 45+45= 90+15= 105. So one day gives us a finished result. That means that there are 105 students attending for only one class (and all conditions). That same set of students is charged for 15\u5b66\u751f\u7684s from the previous condition plus 15 students from the weekly charge, so it makes sense to multiple 33*15= 495(15 students attends each class, multiplied by 33 total number of classes) Therefore the answer to Judy's earnings per week would be$495.
