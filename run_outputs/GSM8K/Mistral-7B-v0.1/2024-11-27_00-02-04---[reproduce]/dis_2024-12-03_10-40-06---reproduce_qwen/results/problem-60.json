Find the number of good oranges by subtracting the known quantities (bad and unripe) from the total. There are 25 total oranges in the basket - 1 bad orange - 5 unripe oranges = 19 good oranges in the basket. Thus, there are $\\boxed{19}$ good oranges.```",
        " total number of oranges that cannot be good (the sum of the bad, unripe, and sour oranges): 1 (bad) + (25 * 20/100 = 5 (unripe)) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges that cannot be good. Subtract this sum from the total to find the number of good oranges: 25 - 8 = 17 (good). The answer is: 17.",
        " are unripe (which means 20/100 times the total number), 2 are sour, the rest (the ones left) are good. Calculate the values for these and solve for how many are good. Let's find this number precisely step by step.",

        " oranges would be \\( 0.20 \\times 25 = 5 \\). Adding up all these values, we get the following:",
        " stated that only one orange is bad. Next, we need to find out how many of the 25 oranges are good. We can break down another part of it as well. First, 1 orange is bad. So subtracting this from the total number gives us 24 oranges remaining. Next 20% are unripe. To find out how many unripe oranges there are, we take 20% of the total number and round it to the nearest whole number. 20% of 24 is 4.8 which rounds to 5. Next, since two are sour, that leaves us with 15 good oranges. If you want, you can double check your math.",
        " count of unripe oranges as follows: There are also 20% unripe oranges; compute the total amount of unripe oranges as follows: 25 x 20% = 5 unripe oranges. 25 oranges minus all the non*b correct options leaves us with 5*20-1*4%*1+2=18 good ones.",
        " the number of sour oranges. There are 2 red apples oranges, so subtract both from the rest of the number of oranges. So the number of good oranges can be calculated by: 25 total oranges - (1 bad) - 2 unripe) - 2 sour = 25-1-2-2 = 20 good. The answer is: 20.``````",
        " = 8%. Total percentage of oranges is: 4% (bad) + 20% (unripe) + 8% (sour) = 32%. The percentage of oranges that are good is therefore: 100% - 32% = 68%. The number of oranges that are good is the percentage of oranges that are good multiplied by the total number of oranges. That is:"
