Multiply the result from above by 4 since it will occur over a 4-week period. 6 + 3 is 9 hours per day. 9 x 3 (first 3 days) is 27 hours. 27 x 4 is 108. The answer is: 108.",

        " he spends reading: It reads half as long as he watches TV so 2/2=1 hour per session. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 hours reading per week.

        " day and then he read for half that time (which is 1 hour), so he reads 1 hour per day.  He reads 1 hour/ day *3 times/ week = 3 hours/week. Therefore, for a week: 6 hours on TV+3 hours on reading=9 hours/ week. Over a period of 4 weeks: 9 hours/ week * 4 weeks =36 hours. The answer is: 36.",
        " the number of days. Multiply (2 hours/day) * (7 days/week) to get 7 days. Multiply 2 hours/weekday for 14 hours/week. Jim also reads, which takes half the amount of time he spends on TV. Divide 2 hours by 2 to find out how long it takes Jim to read each day. Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, or, 2/2 = 1 hour. So now calculate what time Jim reads per day (2 hours for TV / 2 hours of reading). 2/2 = 1. Now we need to know what time he reads per day: he reads 1 hour. Finally we need to know how many hours he reads in one week so: 1 hour/day * 7 days/week = 7 hours/week he reads. He reads 7 hours in 1 week. Therefore 7 hours each day means each week you multiply 7*3 to figure out how much time he reads in 3 days, because he only reads on those 3 days, plus another 7 hours on those other 2 days, plus another week of 7 hours. Add up all the numbers he reads over those four days and that gets us to 21 hours of reading. Next, we will calculate the amount of time he spends watching TV each day: 2 hours/day for three days a week, which totals 6 hours/week. Then we add that to the time he spends reading to get 6+21=27. Simplify this answer to get 8 hours/week + 14 hours/week = 22 hours/week over the 4-week period."
