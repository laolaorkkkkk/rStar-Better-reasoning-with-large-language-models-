We need to solve it in math terms by solving this equation: speed = distance/time. But first, let's convert time to hours. John runs for 23 minutes. Which is the equivalent of 3 hours / 7 days = 13.7142857 minutes. That means about 0.2332384 minutes per day. Thus, John's speed over the three running periods is 60 miles divided by about 0.700 times per day (because there are three days during the entire week in his running schedule plus one less hour he doesn't contribute to his weekly total). His running schedule is 1 day run 3 hours, 2 days 60 minutes each. Dividing 60 miles over 2 hours means 60/2=30miles/hour over those two periods combined. And his third period of running is another 30 miles which he splits up into 30miles/1.5hour=20 miles/hour, so overall his speed is 25 miles/hour.",
        " so he runs 1.5 hours the second and third day. His total running time is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours a week. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the miles he runs by the hours he runs: 60 / 6 = 10 miles per hour. So the answer is: 10.",

However, without further constraints or specific speed calculations provided per type of day, we would typically assume consistent miles per run (or likely simplifying into weekly average for total result).",
