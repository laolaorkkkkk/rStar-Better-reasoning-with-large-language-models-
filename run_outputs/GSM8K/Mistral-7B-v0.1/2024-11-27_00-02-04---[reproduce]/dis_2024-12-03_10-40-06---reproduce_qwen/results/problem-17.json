According to the problem, Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher and 15 hours per week as a\u552eeroing coach. 35 + 15 equals 50 hours per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, Jill works a total of 50 x 50 = 2500 hours in a year. Calculate how much Jill earns each week as a teacher. As a teacher, Jill earns 20 x 35 = 700 dollars a week. Calculate how much Jill earns each week as a\u552eeroing coach. As\u552eeroing coach, Jill earns 30 x 15 = 450 dollars a week. What is Jill's weekly earning when both work? Adding these amounts together: 700 + 450 equals 1150 dollars.
