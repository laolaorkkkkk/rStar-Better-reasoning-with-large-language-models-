The problem states Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.", "2": "Determine how many points Mike scored during the second 20 minutes. Since it is stated that the number of points scored during the second 20 minutes is 25% more than the number of points scored during the first 20 minutes, we can multiply the number of points scored during the first 20 minutes by 1.25 (which is 1+0.25).

Let's say that Mike scored x points during the first 20 minutes and y points during the second 20 minutes. Since the number of points scored during the second 20 minutes is 25% more than the number of points scored during the first 20 minutes, we can write an equation like this: x + 0.25x = y. Solving for y, we get y = 1.25x. Since we know that Mike scored 4 points during the first 20 minutes, we can substitute x = 4 into our equation and get y = 5. Thus, Mike scored 5 points during the second 20 minutes, giving a total of 4 + 5 = 9 points.", "7": "Alternatively, we could use proportional reasoning to determine the increase in points scored during the second 20 minutes relative to the first 20 minutes. We can set up an equation like this: x / (40 / 2) = (y - 4) / (40 / 2), where x represents the points scored during the first 20 minutes, y represents the points scored during the second 20 minutes, and 40/2 represents the total number of minutes played.
