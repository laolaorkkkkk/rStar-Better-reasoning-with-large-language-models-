She can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So if she runs for one hour, she can cover 4 times more distance than if she walked for one hour. That means, if she walks for one hour, she can only cover 1/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour. Now, we know that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she skips for one hour, she can cover half the distance that she could have covered if she ran for one hour. Also, we know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour. This means that if she skips for one hour, she can cover 3 miles. So, if we add up all the distances Dana can cover in one hour, we get (1/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour) + (half the distance she could have covered if she ran for one hour) + (3 miles) = 3 miles.\n\nNow, let's move on to how much distance she travels in 6 hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running, she covers three times the distance that she would have covered if she spent all of her time running. This means that she can cover 3(1/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour) = 3/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour. Also, since she spends two-thirds of the time walking, she covers two times the distance that she would have covered if she spent all of her time walking. This means that she can cover 2(1/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour) = 1/2 of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour. So, in 6 hours, she can cover (3/4th of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour) + (1/2 of the distance she would have covered if she ran for one hour) + (3 miles) = 3 miles.
