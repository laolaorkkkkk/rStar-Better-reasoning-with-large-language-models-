Now, we have all the necessary information to calculate how many miles she can travel in six hours. She will spend one-third of the time running, so she will run for 2 hours.

We know that Dana runs at a rate of speed 4 times faster than she can walk. This means if she walks at x miles per hour, then she runs at 4x miles per hour. We also know that she skips at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means if she skips at y miles per hour, then she runs at 2y miles per hour. As we know, Dana can run at 3 miles per hour, so 2y = 3. This means y = 3 / 2 = 1.5 miles per hour. Therefore, Dana skips at 1.5 miles per hour. To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to take into account the fact that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let's first look at the portion of time spent running. Since Dana runs at 4x miles per hour and spends one-third of the time running, this means she travels at a rate of (4x / 3) miles per hour. For the portion of time spent walking, since Dana walks at x miles per hour and spends two-thirds of the time walking, this means she travels at a rate of (x / 3) miles per hour. Adding up these rates of travel, Dana can travel at a rate of ((4x / 3) + (x / 3)) miles per hour. To find the distance travelled in six hours, multiply this rate of travel by six hours: (((4x / 3) + (x / 3)) * 6) miles. Substituting our value for y, we get: (((4(1.5) / 3) + (1.5 / 3)) * 6) miles.
