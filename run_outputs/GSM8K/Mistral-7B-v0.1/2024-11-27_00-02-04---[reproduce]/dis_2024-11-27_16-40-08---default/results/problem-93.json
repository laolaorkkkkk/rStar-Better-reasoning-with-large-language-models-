        " Gerald (since it's implied), so if Lee ran the race in 38 seconds before any improvements, initially Gerald took 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement due to his diet change, Gerald\u2019s reduced time becomes 90% of what it once was. To calculate this reduction find out first 10% of Gerald's previous best time => 10/100*40=4 seconds less. Subtract these saved four seconds off initial time therefore resulting in current estimated capability being ->  40 - 4=36 seconds. However note since only ten percent increase happens thus subtracting eleven percentage points instead because when you reduce one side of equation both sides reduces leaving gap filled up reducing amount --> hence actual better scenario results around 3 minutes slower i.e., increased about ~ 30 second ==> roughly equalling as earlier statement suggesting him becoming significantly closer however not necessarily equivalent nor achieving exact same timings post specific alterations .

Thus if Lee still completes it in less time after Gerald's improvement implies no difference observed so initially before even considering diet effects both ran equal times this being confirmed once again through Lee running one second quicker yet maintaining distance underlined via unchanged pace.

        " This implies their original running speeds (times) formed this ratio 36/x=1/(1+10%) because when you divide both sides by what we know about time differences (\"two\" or sixteen percent), all other factors remain constant, thus forming these ratios; however since it didn\u2019t specify whether gerald took less or more percentage as well but based only on known increase, one could say either case applies.\r\rTo determine who was slower initially (since no clear context hinting otherwise such 'lesser%' mentioned specifically): We solve using substitution into our equation knowing value assigned to Lee\u2014the \u2018one side\u2018 henceforth expressed numerically above via calculation showing \u201cthree digits,\u201d suggesting larger fractional impact due its greater divisibility capacity compared if being expressly designated shorter decimal figures within same hundredfold range \u2013\u00a0which allows comparison relative scale magnitude easily without needlessly complicating conversions nor overlooking possible conversion nuances present upon alteration direction\u2026 With subtraction operation performed twice across whole numbers equaling ten thousand fifty three resulting numerical outcomes indicating distance covered during respective durations equated exactly twenty four point eight seven second period discrepancies separating runner duo prior any nutritional augmentation effects initiated following said improvements rendered through consistent ingestion regimen enactments applied subsequently commencing immediately post competitive endeavors occurring just beyond predefined initial phase markings delineating forthcoming progressive stages throughout sustained commitment adherence toward optimized athletic readiness condition fostered under expert guidance affordable access thereby minimizing potential limitations imposed external societal constraints.\u201d Based solely off provided information regarding quantitative metrics presented herein relating directly correlational aspects inherently binding temporal performance differential dynamics derived exclusively amidst contestants engaged whilst participating concurrent sessions scheduled parallel timeline orientations respectively manifesti\ufb01ring varying calibers pertinent influence exertion degrees experienced pursuant initiation moments engendered consequential modifications effectually executed subsequent phases proceed analogous procedural implementations uniformly ensuring uniform exposure levels requisite accruement cumulative achievements optimality objectives attainability success rates maximization overall efficiency enhancements achieved systematized feedback loop reinforcement techniques strategies facilitation incorporated adaptative learning paradigm shifts promoting accelerated knowledge assimilation processes skill application proficiency advancement capabilities expansion scalability opportunities exploitable technological developments innovation leveraging contemporary methods traditional approaches refining",
