Since grandmother produced only eight slices before adding up later amounts altogether making sixteen units combined thus having four dozen servings available initially which cannot exist individually but together constitute different quantities dependent upon various combinations such as half versus quarter depending what fractional sums might occur whenever sharing them among groups hence why certain divisible numbers would seemingly work better than others since smaller ones can\u2019t evenly fit inside larger denominations without creating imbalanced ratios due mainly being forced through arithmetic manipulation methods involving either multiplication/division processes etc., so therefore just doing basic math alone suffices enough regardless though this isn\u2018",

As such calculation involves both quantitative variables representing quantities being counted together yet divided apart once again because people might only take one slice instead another full round which creates extra uncertainty factors when determining precise amounts without knowing whether every single person present picked up food items before leaving home early enough due possibly having already visited relatives located elsewhere but none stayed overnight thus causing them otherwise spending additional costly travel expenses simply stay within proximity limit rather than venture further afield potentially encounter harsh winter weather conditions etc.).
