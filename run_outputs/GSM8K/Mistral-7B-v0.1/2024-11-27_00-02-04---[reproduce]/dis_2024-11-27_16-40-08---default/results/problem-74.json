        " pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias. Since we need rounded values it looks like this... (round price value)    [ MARIGOLD   PETUNIA BEGONIA ] Price ($/pot )Price($/pot)$Price(per pot)    2     1      2 Next calculate quantity multiplied by their respective costs which yields.... Quantity*$Cost= Money made ...for example : Q*C=$Mmaked        Pot Number          Amount           Total               Calculate summed totals.....                         Totalled cost              Thus when calculating ..the answers look something similar..to ....Totaled Cost:(Round)(Quantity(Marigold)*$Amount/( Round))+(Qty(Petunia)* Rprice)+((QtyBegonia)*$(Rounded)= Ttotaledcost=(sum of above quantities & priced items).Now putting everything together using actual numbers , you get $([(12*(2)),{(9*(1)}), {(17*(2)})] . You add these amount up,(Summarized as below:$[$(TotalfromitemA)+$totalfromitemb]+$totalfromitemc])you find out your grand total or lastly what artifax makes.$[($(wereincome)-{$expenses}]or$$=[$.Calculatedvalue].For details follow this link ;https://www.mathcelebrity.com/dollarroundingformula.php This page explains calculations very well regarding this question https://brainkukimprover.webhiveabc.net/",
        " get individual totals before converting them into rounded amounts Rounded off values would hence be as follows; Total value (Rounded) made while buying marigolds=$2*12= $24 ;Total Value(Rounded)=$2*(number purchased)(Petunias)$1*9= $9;and finally ,total value($)=2*$21/potted=(rounded )=34 . Finally add up these numbers..  24+9+34=<<24+9+34=67>>67 .. ",
        " (pots) x $2.74 (price/pot) equals around $33 for marigold sales(this calculation includes the decimal). Do this process similarly for petunias and begonias as well; 9 times $1.87 comes close approximately equaling $17 ($0 when rounded down), while 17 multiplied by $2.12 results roughly in about $36 ($6 overround due to approximation). Add these figures together. Approximately adding up $33+$17+$36 we get almost worth about $86 without any error margin introduced into calculations because it was necessary only to approximate based off pricing info provided which itself wasn\u2019t precise enough. Therefore I would say artie makes nearly nearer but not exactly eighty six Dollars assuming approximations mentioned above didn't throw too high errors upon summing individual values calculated earlier regarding four types differents floras available within specified parameters set forth initially relieving him financially throughout transactioanl operation conducted daily during market seasonality events experienced annually occurring biannually interchanging periods deemed agriculturist trading cycles prevalent worldwide henceforth establishable thus far through economic modelling techniques aimed towards identifying patterns amongst multiple variables involving distinct commodities namely those identified previously specifically focused concentrated efforts targetting single entities belonging sole category consisting floral items categorised thereby separated accordingly subdivisions created further delineating separate monetary valuation methodologies implemented uniquely differentiated procedures employed strictly adhering established normative principles governing business activities related directly correlatively linked corresponding relationships forming basis foundational underpinning structures integral component framework constitutively inclusive collectively contributing holistic comprehensive entity representative entirety composite complex synthesis unity cohesion convergence harmony balance integratability orchestration efficacy efficiency performance effectiveness yield optimum output optimal outcome superb success achievement superiority excellence exemplification embody paradigm representation standard model benchmark best practice guideline ultimate goal maximization realisation maximum satisfaction fulfillment happiness enjoyment pleasure contentment peace tranquility calm serenity comfort relief relaxation rest rejuvenation renewal revitalization vitality vigor energy dynamism zest spirit enthusiasm passion zeal fervor ardor commitment allegiance fidelity loyal service dedication faithfulness integrity honesty veracity truthfulness accurate preciseness accuracy exactitude correct",

        " And for begonias, it would be $2.12 x 17= $36.04. Add up these amounts. Total earnings equals $32.88 (marigolds) + $16.83(petunias)+$36.04 (begonias)= $85.75 Rounded off totals equal rounded values ($33+$17+$36). Finally subtract any difference due to original calculations vs current real ones($85.75-$85) which results into $0.75 discrepancy or loss as actual gain turns out to be less than initial calculated value before being made precise because quantities weren't able to exactly match their corresponding place values when converted back post calculation hence resulting into financial gap .
