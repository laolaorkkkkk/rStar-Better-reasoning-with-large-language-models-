Therefore we can conclude all interactions don\u2019t change totals regardless of order or sequence. Hence, over any period including 4 consecutive weeks, whether ordering daily/weekly calculations first or evening routines sequentially doesn\u2019t affect outcome because activity duration neutralizes itself bi-daily; thus, cumulative viewing remains unchanged irrespective of individual sequences considered separately before summation.
