        " as Ben's. Since we know that Ben's iPhone age is twice (Ben=Suzy*2), this implies; therefore ben's iphone becomes 'twice' or doubled value i.e., if suzy's iOS is 'x',ben would become '2x'. This makes it easy for us to determine brandon since based off our relation above brandon equals bens which was just calculated so...brandon = beniphoneage(n) Hence ,brandon = bens/foursome ; meaning n+bemainsfoursoon..let's calculate these variables out : Let X=suzy's ios  2X = benosios . thus   2^2= 4 hence 4===(the variable assigned above).and finally let N=brandomios.meaningN+(numberoftimesitsasold)*previousone(variableassignedahead)=finaloutcome(whatwearesolvingforhere)..that means....lets see~if you get stuck along any part here ~askquestion!Based on my calculations using simple algebra below :)Here goes ..

        " Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's phone. Thus if we add these relationships together it becomes clear; since suzies age multiplied by 2 (suzy_age) equals ben(ben), which when multiplied again makes brands new integer value equaling   bens_int/brands_multiplier . Since this statement would not make sense mathematically , I am going to instead conclude your original intent here was just clarification without implying multiplication rather its simply saying Bobs iphone being double what susy owns so lets call that variable 'twice'. This means our equations thus far become twc=(b)*(bs). Plugging into last equation results yields 2*bs=tws*(b)=tsucy+(tbog); simplifies down furthermore finally yielding bs+btw==tsuc; hence Bnxs phon can best be expressed as tsuc-(btw)-basically whatever remains out of everything else upon distribution via subtraction or negative symbol addition thereby leaving only thing known namely TSCU minus any remaining factors such AS BOGS.. However note however! Your question asked nothing about calculating specific ages within those numbers mentioned above therefore im sticking w/basic logic & facts regarding them themselves&nothing deeper otherwise...
