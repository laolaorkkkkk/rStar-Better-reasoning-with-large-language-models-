Logical inconsistencies arise when deducing negative values appearing next to something purportedly counting individuals ..So logically since actual humans don't subtractions yield fractions but integer figures instead ! Therefore keeping practicalities aside while doing math calculations lets round off those little surplus amounts arising near zero margins above floor levels without necessarily dividing whole entity portfolios entirely equal distributionwise eg consider say one extra person decides upon opting yet another option leaving none behind rather than distributing even splits around shared boundaries ...therein lies simplifying rationale !! As you see if rounded back onto nearest integers yields exactly same outcome minus certain few units 'roundings might just alter small enough sidelines overshadow no longer any discrepancy exists ....so basically considering exact value representation within realms possiblity limits remain intact whilst acknowledging minuscule variations due random chance influences may occur thereby impactfully affect potential differences margin wise whenever regrouping ensues subsequent time intervals.....thus conclusion remains slightly affected owning unto possible minor adjustments",
