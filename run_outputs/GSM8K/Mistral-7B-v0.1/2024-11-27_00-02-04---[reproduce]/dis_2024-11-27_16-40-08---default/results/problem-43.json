To find out what we currently consume subtract our intake so far which means; calculate (1250 \u2212 1800).

Resolving the above equation results positive value of approximately ~44grams. Therefore when considering dietary guidelines one might not exceed their respective allowed amounts hence even thought technically possible only around half portion size (=approximately about |~|~40 gram<sep/>servinsion|) could remain within prescribed recommended limits assuming no other higher calories snacks have yet been considered before achieving these set parameters..
