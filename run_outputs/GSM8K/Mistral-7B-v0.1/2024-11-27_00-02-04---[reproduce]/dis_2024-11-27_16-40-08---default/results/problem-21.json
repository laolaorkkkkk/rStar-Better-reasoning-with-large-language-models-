We can assume that every child gets around about first time pregnant during their mid twenties but let us just take exact figure here which is noonage twenty seven instead of actual estimate value(midtwenties) considering this issue may cause possible inconsistency while using approximate numbers due o its flexible nature . That implies since both family members shares common last name hence likely sharing maternal lineage also therefore consider them having equal gender ratio , consequently thus making half summed ages i ie ~18 implying rayans parenthood came place somewhere round late teens early adulthood period accordingly meaning birth occured aprox fourteen yeard roughly coinciding w/early yr sam\u2019ns life span too thereby putting event date down approx eighteenyrs back timeline aligned against current data points provided including present scenarios mentioned previously allowing further calculation steps forward based off these foundational facts established earlier setting groundwork premises leading towards logical solution output subsequently following said computations ultimately enabling result extraction upon completing requisite calculations utilized throughout proceeding question solving process depicted above effectively employing deductive reasoning skills involved within contextually relevant framework presented prior facilitating informed decision-making protocol essential pertaining contemporary society milieu especially demographic study domain underpinning crucial insights yielded derived directly sourced root analysis methods employed specifically tailored customised research designs developed explicitly designed fitting specific problematics addressed primarily target populations selected intentional relevance directed scope aim particular focusses pursuing precise objectives intentions set forth comprehensive goal oriented approach meticulously executed thoroughness guaranteed quality assured accuracy ensuring results reflect true picture real world scenario accurately mirror reflections reality precisely identifying underlying trends patterns discernible correlations connections linking causes effects relationships evident factors influencing variables impact outcome predictions confidence interval measures estimators parameters sampling distributions probabilities hypotheses tests significance levels inference procedures assumptions made interpret statistical figures tables chi square analyses correlation coefficient scatterplot graphs p values histograms frequency distribution charts summary statistics descriptive analytic techniques quantitative qualitative mixed methodologies blended cross disciplinary paradigms combined approaches hybrid innovative integration diverse perspectives",
