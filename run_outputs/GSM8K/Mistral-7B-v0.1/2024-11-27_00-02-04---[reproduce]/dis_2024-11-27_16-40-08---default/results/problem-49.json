Last but not least subtract your resultant figure representing fully taken living spots (i.e., filled condos etc.) , as opposedto vacant ones so you get [(Total possible units \u2013 Occupied Units )]=([120-(90)]=)[These represent non inhabited residences).

Determine if most apartments or not based on information provided i n question . It says only about half (+/- )of them currently house residents thus roughly speaking around 60% might still remain empty since this means we may consider approximately one quarter being vacant because these conditions sum up close enough to just over three quarters occupancy rate already stated but let\u2019s figure it out as precisely yet using basic math concepts here \u2014 considering exactly what fraction represents less than full occupation ; so our initial estimation was slightly off comparedto actual circumstances due too common mistake when misreading such proportions especially ones involving fractions like \u201cless\u201dand \u201dhalf\u201d.

        ". Determine what fraction of these units are currently not used or vacant using inverse operations (multiplication). According to the prompt, only three fourths of those living spaces occupy themselves fully. That means one half remains free since four quarters make up a whole space which this question implies as 'unavailable'. Calculate the exact amount representing empty housing units multiplying our previous result derived figure (total unit count) times fractions available for use. Thus we get  120 units *(one fifth) equals= 120 divided by five equaling exactly 24 additional rooms still waiting occupation. Consequently, there exist twenty identical residential sections within your multi-storeyed complex yet just sixteen houses inhabited presently leaving eight seats allotted sole residence without anybody utilizing them right away. Hence summed together it forms quite literally about thirty seven percent less crowded dwellings considering twelve being deserted while remaining seventeen abodes taken over completely therefore reducing general congestion issues typically faced during peak seasons especially around rush hours thus allowing inhabitants peaceful time amidst friends along family members who also value their personal space apartments become perfect examples too!

Remembering fractions might help; when something says 'three quarters', think about dividing things into four equal segments --only take one segment here because 'one quarter' means exactly halfway towards filling all available spots if everything was full ; our target fractional value thus becomes simply ___ /4_ divided once due its being just __quarter___(^) , not multiple ones like \u00bd &\u2154 etc..

With values plugged accordingly, our calculation becomes; `(total_units)*(percent not full)`, i.e., `= 120*0.25`.
