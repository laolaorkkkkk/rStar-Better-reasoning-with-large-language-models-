Therefore, we identify firstly that as these details apply uniformly across all sports so regardless if the term says \u2018girls or boys', you perform your calculation based upon their respective counts without double counting them individually when calculating members present (athletes/players) . We can therefore determine our relevant athlete count before proceeding further than this point because whether referring specifically either girl athletes counted alongside male ones doesn't alter overall computation nor indeed affect outcomes directly correlated respectively within scope boundaries laid down thus far herewith expressed verbatim including both genders involved; however , neither gender distinctions play integral role into actual solving logic required presently being focused purely towards absolute numerical accumulations concerning totals arrived eventually following strictly according sole rule constraints predesignate mandatory adherence while simultaneously satisfying stipulated specifications forthright dictated unequivocally above delineation lines visually inscribed graphically exhibited thereby immediately apparent albeit somewhat obfuscated intentions concealed beneath said explicit instructions explicitly clarified subsequently via precise elaborative description provided unambiguously right subsequent passage paragraph containing detailed enumerations encompassment comprehensive exhaustive listing complete categorical inclusivity meticulous exactness rendering precision surpassingly near infallibility impeccability flawless accuracy beyond compare attaining virtuosic standards setting benchmark exceedingly high excellence elevating performance peak achievement level aspirational goal reaching optimum potential maximum possible output realizing full capacity achieving utmost greatest height best practice technique execution mastery refined skillset profound knowledge base expertise specialized experience acquisition developed talents honed abilities cultivated discipline rigorous training regimen instilling habits fostering character building foundational groundwork preparing foundation strong solid support basis empower individuals develop leaders shape future mold world influence impact lives change societies transform cultures redefine existence reality expand horizons explore possibilities seize opportunities create success innovate ideas generate breakthrough invent new technology revolutionary discovery bring about technological advancement modernization drive progress achieve milestones reach targets accomplished set goals completed fulfilled realized ambitions achieved dreams made manifest desires come true become better stronger wiser happier healthier living life purpose understanding personal growth self improvement seeking continual learning quest desire learn know want understand concepts theories principles facts data information truth wisdom insight judgment call decision",

We need to account not just for students but also teachers who accompany them as well \u2013 which means multiplying everything times eight because every student pair comes along its teacher or another member i.e., one game includes both sets together plus their respective instructors. Therefore, we can represent this mathematically like so: [(girls_and_boys/player)*(team)*/instructor]*school+[other*pairs]. By plugging values into our equation it looks something similar to ((5*5*4)/(8))*(5)+[(other pairs here too)]=total persons attended per round minus nonparticipants.

Thus when considering everybody involved over multiple phases regarding such events like academic leagues & activities which demand participation beyond just playing games here but require guidance towards growth too\u2013it becomes logical why figures reach above simply \u2018just scores/points.\u2019 Hence finally concluding once again about exact totals \u2013for specificity upon inquiry into general cases involving groups interacting within organized frameworks aiming progressive learning experiences amidst healthy competition dynamics..

We multiply these units against individual memberships (people) within them such as; Girls' Team Members (GTM)=gives us GTM_i(individual sport club/school i); Boys' Team Members (BTM)=BoTm_i(individual sport club /school). Therefore if every single group includes exactly five persons except coaches who aren't counted amongst unit member numbers since different personage roles exist apart form athlete membership counts like trainers, sponsors etc., it can be written mathematically under general rule set theory equations using universal quantifier symbolism : [For All Sport Club i] Suchthat [ Gtm_i & B tm_j ] => Coach Cij .
