Additionally, having invested three times into various footwear options amounting to sixteen dollars per item yields yet again an addition of 3*42=126 dollars. Combining these expenditures together provides us with the comprehensive total outlay; summing up as such equates to 51.50+67.50+126 equals precisely to  245 dollars.

Yet if considering only nonnegative numbers(ignoring negativity) based purely off our current contextual variables ; your assertion would translate slightly differently stating '$|$Negative_Spending|$_{total} <= 64.78$.
