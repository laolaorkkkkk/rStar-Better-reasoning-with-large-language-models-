It makes sense what we need next only upon analyzing these statements carefully enough since it involves understanding economic concepts like demand curves & elasticities.. Here goes : First let me simplify things down using numbers again--but don't worry about all those fancy words anymore :) . Let X represent quantity demanded(the amount consumers wish /need).

This means that buying these bigger bags yields significant advantages so let\u2019s check whether their overall impact results in net gains over time rather than simply immediate monetary spending concerns like most folks consider when shopping anyway...

We calculate [(18/(2+1))]*($.5)=($6)$. This means that it takes three units priced individually purchased via group bargains; therefore our equation above equals $$$6$.
