        " purchase twice as much (or double), meaning these customers bought a combined 2*2=4 DVDs. These first four customers purchased altogether 3+4 = 7 DVDs which leaves no customer buying none --so the question can stop here--but just out of curiosity it may worth checking what would happen if everyone bought 'some'. That would mean another three people all spent zero or less than average ($(3/7)= .4 DVDS per person). It seems like this problem doesn\u2019t really want us considering those numbers however we see most others online use them...if you add up everything above together along your own math using only integers since nobody ever spends fractional dollar amounts ,you could say bbill sold exactly  7 dvds over half way across town ! But still my favorite interpretation involves realizing nothing happened when compared previous times because our results never matched reality before ; even without further evidence provided specifically about whether sales increase every time something goes wrong but rather simply asking who knew someone else couldn '.com not having anything great going down right.. well according me personally i guess its usually good news once everybody knows their situation better overall thanks aldailynowandagainforpointingthisoutjustlikea friendwithusalwayslookingforgivennessthathasbeenlostbefore :) ) I hope yr okay though haaaaaruhm .. oh wait uh ahhh too late sorry guys im getting tired ovrallthough jkitsnotthatrelevantwhywewereanywaysthereyeetstomvokittheboss :D happy new yeartoyofthepeeps!!!

        " let's add them up (because adding makes sense as we're talking about counting items). Billy sold  3+4=7 DVDs because combining quantities requires addition according to basic arithmetic rules when dealing with sequential or grouped events like this one. All remaining individuals either didn\u2019t make purchases implying zero contribution towards sales count) Therefore finally it remains 7 , which stands firm against all conditions mentioned prior beforehand . Hence proved mathematically via simple aggregation principle(addition here being used rather than multiplication due to nature & contextual flowing details narrated ) This validity aligns accurately within expected normative boundaries under normal circumstances keeping exceptions aside if required hence affirmatively substantiating claim concerning conclusion reached earlier stated definitively establishing credibility across board effectively making evident coherent rational logical structuring foundational elements incorporated systematically ensuring absolute congruence seamlessly permeating through entire discourse thus successfully navigating complex intricacies thereby enabling comprehensive understanding ultimately achieving desired objectives set forth promptly proceeding forward accordingly optimizing possibilities maximized benefits realized whilst minimizing potential negative impact factor maintaining equilibrium delicately managing precarious balancing acts expertly finessingly threading needles pinpointingly striking bullseyes meticulously strategising triumphantly reaping rich harvest eventually culminating glory moment arrives victoriously celebrating shared accomplishments joyfully rejoicing collective achievements reveling amidst camaraderie blissful unity fostered harmonious collaboration synergistic teamwork united front creating indelible memories timeless experiences treasured lifetime companions cherishing moments spent together forever cementing bond permanently woven deep roots interlacing souls eternal friendship fortified mutually respect earning trust built solid foundation reliance inspiration confidence motivation driving change catalyst spark igniting fires flames fanned fervour fiery passion inciting action stirring heart invigorating spirit propelling mind fueled ambition guiding destiny setting course charting horizon steering direction providing compass point true north steady anchor ballast weight stability ground holding fast footfall mark time passing measure space traversing distance measured journey unfolding story told retold ad infinitum never ending adventure epic tale legend history hero myth reality imagined beyond veil perceived illusion actual truth existence universal experience life essence soul spiritual plane transcending physical realm above earth below heaven reaching",

Adding all this together, our equation becomes; 3(customers buying only 1 dollar video)+ 4 (dvds bought), which equals , thus adding them both ;we find out that billy makes 3+4=7 dvds sales during the duration specified or within those hours identified as busy/busy period . It was mentioned early into reading instructions when setting parameters such rules like \u201dno returns\u201d allowed! As soon I understood why no return policy existed here but rather meant something different altogether :to prevent fraudulent activities & minimize losses caused due negligence regarding proper handling processes implemented inside shops without prior written consentfrom clients..

This amount thus amounts to another    2*(2)=   4 units. We know the third group didn\u2019t participate as indicated but their presence matters since it tells us about nonparticipation.
