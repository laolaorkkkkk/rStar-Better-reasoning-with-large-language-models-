        " To find out the combined price of both pairs we need to add them up remembering second pair costs double what first priced ($33) because it said 'other...costs twice as much'. That would mean adding another half (because if something doubles, you can also see this operation like multiplying by .5/2). This means: $($33)+(($33)\\cdot.5)=$33+$16.5==$49.5 Together the two pairs equal fourteen dollar difference compared to the price of boot but since Gloria doesn\u2019t want to exceed spendings limit let us just use amount instead using word '$fourteen', which converts into forty two numerical values.\r",
        " also tells us it's double the first pair ($33), making them worth $33 * 2 = $66. Add both prices together because Gloria was comparing this amount against what she would pay if she opted for these over the cheaper pair (boots). Therefore, $33 (one pair) plus $66 (another pair) equals $99 combined for those specific high heel styles. Since we know the combination of said footwear options fits within Gloria's boot purchase decision range better due being \"$five(+-)\". Hence subtracting/adding $5 makes sense here meaning '$99+$$5=$104', so, logically speaking, the expensive set doesn\u2019t exceed her capability but exactly meets or marginally surpasses it too \u2013 implying neither sets individually nor their sum can represent individual choices unless stated differently. As such logical deduction concludes gloria 'couldn't afford any choice outside having buying boots': regardless which actual pricing mechanism you subscribe; whether addition (+$) vs multiplication (*); yet still reaching same outcomes hence showing transitivity property holds valid even amidst inconsistent contextual clues like \"+/-\" expressions appearing interchangeably without explicit clarity defining absolute value difference operations required subsequently affecting resulting figures calculated postwardly based solely upon initial values assigned precedence importance accordingly before applying basic arithmetic procedures thus establishing base logic foundations necessary forming coherent mathematical proofs supporting truth claims regarding quantitative relationships presented during discussions aiming prove hypothesis assumptions true false correct errors identified thereby helping avoid future misunderstandings stemming potentially faulty reasoning practices frequently associated misinterpretation unsubstantiated conclusions drawn hastily sometimes leading erroneous assertions about unknown variables related issues involved especially pertain theoretical concepts underlying question asked seeking comprehensive understanding all while respecting established rules governing numerical symbol interpretation employed throughout solving process undertaken ensuring integrity remains preserved always adhering rigorous standards demanded meticulously scrutinize every stage carefully considered detailed explanation provided above demonstrates clear line distinctiveness separatethese aspects apart facilitating accurate identification respective roles performed particular terms mentioned allowing formulate equations accurately relate quantities under investigation enhancing ability efficiently decipher complex problems encountered successfully employ relevant tools effectively expedite solution efforts reach definitive results confirm initially proposed hypotheses indeed factually represented achieving desired outcome sought ultimately satisfying curiosity engenders desire seek knowledge deeper venture understand intrica",

Find out the combined prices of both the pair of high heels which equals their individual costs ($33+$66) equaling $99. Subtract these totals ($99-$5= ) so Gloria can find what Boots\u2019 cost was within her spending range. With all subtractions made; subtract $5 off of our last calculation revealing Gloria spent $94 instead solely buying those boots alone according to your initial condition . Therefore , since glora couldn't afford either boot along with both dresses due too expensive pricing hence concluded ; thus boots valued only$94 exactly matched her predetermined financial limit! Hence conclude :the value attached towards said item stood firm without exceedanceof stipulated constraintsand remained perfectly inlinewith designated requirementswhile also fulfilling expectationsset forththroughout exercise parameterstherefore arrivistexactvalue(boots): $$94 Exactly !!!

        " $33. It also mentions another pair which costs double this amount, so it would be $33 x 2 = $66. Together both pairs (one set) sum up to $33 + $66 = $99. Since we know these sets collectively cost $5 less than the boots, adding back those amounts tells us Gloria\u2019s potential expenditure \u2013 hence the bootshoes can actually equalize out to $99 plus $5 equalling $104 spent. Therefore if all goes according to plan, assuming no extra taxation or hidden charges due only within their predetermined budget boundaries, gloria could spend not more but exactly precisely fourteen bucks worth on said foot coverings otherwise known commonly referred generically among adult consumers under particular circumstances specified herein above mentioned namely without additional purchasing power beyond what was expressed clearly priorly during negotiation phases involving initial acquisition procedures related directly to item(s) described initially further delineated below accordingly including possibly incidental ancillary goods/supplies purchased concurrently while having fully accounting every bit part involved throughout entire lengthy time frame required complete transaction cycle duration period thus excluding sole consideration regarding possible future repairs necessary afterwards thereby potentially exceeding anticipated purchase limits previously established internally based upon personal preference level relative versus standard normative requirements presently accepted universally worldwide alike amongst various demographics encompassing varying cultural values represented specifically through distinctive artistic expressions such painting style applied creatively towards original concept design representation incorporated into modern retail store formats designed primarily intended toward selling items manufactured predominantly utilizing state-of-the-art technologies employed exclusively developed innovatively over decades long historical timeline spanning centuries earlier periods leading eventually finally arriving right present moment contemporary times just yesterday beginning tomorrow evening tonight perhaps even next week sometime hopefully whenever someone thinks positively looking forwardwards rather backwards reminding oneself always being responsible living life happily ever after regardless whatever choices made daily actions taken constantly adjustment strategies implemented continually changing mindset approach adopted consistently striving goals achieve desires realise dreams make happen accomplishments succeed failures learn valuable lessons apply knowledge gained wisdom develop mature human qualities behaviours encourage others help build strong relationships support families care children love pets etc..

Since it was mentioned earlier that the combined value of the said items equaling their subtraction being only upwards off your original target (five), you could say that the sum equaled boot\u2019s prices plus its subtractive difference ($5).

That amounts to three items totalling $99 ($33 + $66). Finally, since we know the boots alone aren\u2019t expensive enough because their sum doesn\u2019t exceed fourteen points higher compared to glorious red velvet clutches, let your attention move back just once again towards our known values here\u2014this time focusing only upon value addition required per item unit\u2013in this case being \u2018five dollars.\u2019 To summarize further clearly into comprehendible terms; subtracting seven plus six yields twelve but adding ten brings balance exactly downwards onto targeted limit worth fourteen points beyond lowly priced sacks filled straight away following bizarre clown show displays.

We know right off hand if gloria buys any boot instead \u2013 since every dollar saved here makes up precisely half what was spent previously -- everything goes down into negative territory\u2026 That leaves just enough space among options available even before accounting further reductions like taxes etc.. Thus ultimately getting exactly zero units returned minus whatever additional expenses such things involve anyway\u2013 thus leading directly towards having absolutely nothing remaining over once all necessary deductions made against initial purchases plus subsequent changes required due circumstances beyond control(say weather conditions impact transportation).
