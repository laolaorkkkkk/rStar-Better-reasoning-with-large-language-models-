        " cost represents just (1 - 0.25) or three quarters (or 3/4) of its original worth so you can multiply it backwards i.e., divide your calculated value ($19.5) by this fractional part which means first we find out what multiple times one quarter equals $19.5 through simple algebra using steps below : Step One: let Q represent 'one quarter'. Equation as follows q*q=Q; Thus finding our Value for Q(representing 1 Quarter): Solving equation mentioned above [Equation] ,we get :-Value for Q: sqrt{19.5}=sqrt[2]{1} * sqrt[4]{19.5}; thus:- Splitting up under root symbol into factorized square roots forms like-(sqr{2}+qq)=sqrt{P+a},where P stands for prime product equal (=<~))to b),as well subtracting all factors leaving only integer values(i.e.[integer]number).Thus getting rid off any complex figures making sure no decimals form during solving.(Example:)sqrt{[eqquuiv][sub eq]=x}[fcolorbox][url={http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/algebra/radicalnameratioformula.php}](Eq\\(^2\\)\u2212\\([fracp]{}\\)[fracb]{}\\)\u2192Normally,\\({[{calc}]=\\left|\\{{{\\rm Root}}={\\bf C}{{-}{\\sqrt{\\beta \\pm \\sqrt{{\\Delta}}} {}}}\\right|}{}}\\)\\({\\rm N}=\\frac{{\\mathit D}}{{\\mathit B}}\\)\\)Note:\\(\\begin{cases}\\\\\\\\{\\rm Normalize\\;D,B\\,and\\,\\Delta \\,if\\;possible},\\end{cases}\\,\\text{(Normalize)}\\)\\(\\rightarrow {\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} } u(t){\\dd u}(t)=\\Bigg\\{\\lim_{{\\xi\\rightarrow{} +\\infty }}u(\\xi)-\\sum _{k=-B}^{\\infty }\\binom{A}_{k}}{\\bigg[-^{\\large I}}_{}^{\\small J}}\\\\ & =\\sum ^{M}_m F(m)\\,du\\,dx \\\\ \\qquad &=(F_1(X)+\\cdots+F_k(X))\\, dx,\\, k \\leq m .\\nonumber\\\"\\); From:(above example link)&quot;\\(U(-\u221e)-\u2211k\u2013B",
        " 4 (since this means buying four books instead of one). That makes the calculation as follows:$19.50*4=$78. Therefore, Kiley paid around \\$78 if we round off because \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is closest to 1 when rounded into nearest whole numbers according to RPN rules.
