Thus if keeping safety first, Polly may start around 'approximately [CQICue]3[/CQICue] kilometers out.'

Therefore, standing anyplace beyond this limit would mean hitting the target but being burnt up in return. Hence, even though theoretically possible due to higher velocity/distance provided while throwing with gemstone, practically safe zone remains inside or equal to the initial arm length i.e., lesser part of 400 ft away as no extra safety margin was mentioned against getting wounded despite having increased ability without injury per se implied here indirectly through comparison.
