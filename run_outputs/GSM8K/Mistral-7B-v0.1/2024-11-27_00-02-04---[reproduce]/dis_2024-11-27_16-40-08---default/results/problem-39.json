Given all these factors put together; let's focus only on distances covered during activities falling into 'running'. Therefore : Running -> Walking Speed Ratio = Run / Walk = 4/Walk . From our problem , Skipping Distance(Rate)= Skip Rate= S=Skip Time*Speed => We need to find out W --> Use ratio & set up equations based on provided data above ==> [run]:[walk]=:[skips]=(Run)/(Walk)=x:(y):z===> 4w:(W)(X)[which yields z/(Y)=([Z]/[Y])=((RUN_TIME/WALK_TIME)*SPACE())[[because RUN TIME > SKIP TIME ]].

We also need our constants which include current known values like; Skipping Speed= S_speed(Skip)=3mph ; RunningSpeed/WalkingSpeed ratio R=(Run/Walk)RATIO=.25 , Hence WalkSpeed W=SkippedSpeed / Ratio=3/.25 mph=12MpH .

They may vary slightly depending certain factors however general idea remains same whenever discussions occur relating towards Skipping Versus Running Or Walking Situations Specifically Related To Distance Travelled During Specific Times !!!! Last bit remaining piece lies behind finding average length distances covered every second throughout whole journey hence why simplifying variables earlier seemed logical enough considering factual amounts mentioned elsewhere provided above while keeping mind various alternative possibilities regarding individual skills involved whilst calculating precisely alike results expected via methods previously listed ....
