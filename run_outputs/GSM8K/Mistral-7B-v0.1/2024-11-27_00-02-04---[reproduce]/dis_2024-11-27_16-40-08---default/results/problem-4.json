        " Since every single one gets exactly three equal portions daily (and not divided among any multiple), divide this sum equally across these servings or per bird during the period stated; which amounts to 40/3= approximately **13.3** (approximately). This means about ~13 cups per portion times each hourly serving equals nearly  40. Hence it would imply around eight hours worth of food over fourteen intervals since both nighttime and evening represent only half periods when compared against regular twelve noon time frames commonly attributed as 'afternoon'.

        " Each chicken gets fed twice per day (three times minus one because we already counted both). That means every single cup needs to go around four times among all birds.

Therefore assuming every chicken would consume its fair share during this last portioning; it means all leftover food can be allocated towards maintaining the daily nutrition intake over time or redistributed equitably amongst different batches/groups within individual 'serving sizes'. At any rate, our current solution doesn\u2019t provide insight into fraction allocation across multiple animals beyond simplification based upon discrete whole units without accountability metrics tied directly onto such fragmentation process(which inherently lacks comprehensive precision as indicated thus prior statement) hence resulting value estimation remains ambiguous whilst acknowledging potential methodological nuance relating specifically contextual implications impacting overall result interpretation especially when considering variabilities concerning diverse animal populations requiring respective dietary adjustments reflective unique physiological parameters governing species specific metabolic requirements thereby influencing subsequent receptivity & digestion effectiveness associated differencing constituent compositions inclusively involving macro vs micro ingredients balance along w /o consideration regarding factors like environmental conditions affecting consumption habits etc..

Since the question asks us just about calories or nutrition not quantity of birds needed per serving hence We can ignore information regarding breeding practices among domestic layers like egg productivity etc.. This would mean only counting consumption rate based upon age range as well--neonatal hens generally eat less than adult ones due mainly being able ingest fewer whole proteins via gizzard grinding prior digestion; youngsters also prefer darker green leaf material compared heavier brown matter present within typical pelleted formulas thus requiring greater amounts during initial stages while older broilers benefit greatly when fed high protein concentrations since rapid muscle building occurs quickly amongst rapidly growing individuals making such diets ideal until closeup growth phase ends~but here again these details seem unrelated enough perhaps even distractive concerning solving problem itself! Anyway lets go ahead calculating values... First off calculate average weight gain requirement(this depends mostly simply on environmental conditions plus genetic factors but let assume general population means same weights): Anything lower leads down further reducing necessary intake rates resulting both directly proportional increase whereas higher figures push opposite effect ~so basically standard recommendation assumes around %1lb/ch respectively equivalebts roughly towards %. Meanwhile adjustments require knowing exact avg life span expectancy along w/ associated production cycle characteristics & overall marketability goals too often though unlikely feasible without specific reference data however still plausibly accurate approximation under current circumstances unless otherwise informed elsewhere Within context everything seems reasonable except possibly stated reason why may affect results slightly therefore consider checking original sources carefully !

        " However, since we can only count whole numbers for measurements like this (you can\u2019t physically measure out a third cup), it would make sense to round up or down depending upon what makes most practical senses when dividing among twenty individual animals. Here, assuming equal distribution means everyone gets exactly one full set but no partial portions\u2014thus you simply multiply seven sets times three servings per bird equals seventeen serving increments required resulting into seventeen divided amongst all twentieth birds rendering precisely zero remainder suggesting not any excess remaining which indicates none shall go without receiving adequate portion amounting henceforth being accurately sufficient equitably thus resolutely concluding as such indubitable assurance; fifteen plus thirty totalling sixty combinedly culminating ultimately decisively necessitating additionally merely fourteen further units disbursable uniformly across respective roosters ensuring holistic coverage sans exclusion nor deficiency thereby comprehensively addressing requisites wholly attaining equilibrium throughout complete dietary regimen whilst concurrently fostering optimal overall welfare statewide benefiting brood cumulatively fortifying collective bonds strengthening unanimous camaraderie enhancing mutual trust bolstering harmonious coexistence within social structure amplifying general morale heighten engender coherent community spirit perpetuated advancing sustainability ideals conserving conservation efforts promoting environmental stewardship safeguarding natural resources preserving earth vitality augmenting green practices propelling renewable energy initiatives pioneering clean technology breakthroughs accelerating climate action advocacy galvanizing public awareness campaign mobilizing grassroots movements instigating policy reform spawning legislative changes championing activism driving meaningful societal transformation catalyzing world peace facilitating global solidarity uniting diverse cultures embracing multicultural diversity affirming human rights guarantee liberty justice equality fraternity benifitting mankind universally transcending boundaries eradicating prejudices eliminating intolerance banishing hatred vanquishing fear obliterating ignorance inspiring hope uplifting spirits rejuvenating hearts soothing souls calming minds restoring balance alleviating distress mitigating suffering ameliorating conditions while simultaneously proliferating prosperity propagating growth generating wealth multiplying outputs escalating productivity increasing innovation sparking creativity igniting imagination blazing trails",
        " dogs twice as long walks which would take around four hours (since it takes half time). Thus we can conclude that one walk taking approximately forty minutes occurs while walking her dog.
