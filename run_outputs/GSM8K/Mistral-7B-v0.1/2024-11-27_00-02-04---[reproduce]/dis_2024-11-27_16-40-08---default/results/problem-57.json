        " To find out how much cargo (boxes) it supports when fully packed, first subtract their weights. That would mean you\u2019d start off finding what the allowed box load adds to make sure still doesn\u2019t surpass 5000lbs; this means calculating just \u201cloaded_weight\u201d. Since everything including drivers/truck itself counts towards max capacity so : `max(allowed_pounds)=bridge*load` , solving above equation yields  5000=5*load+3755 =>   1245=(5*.load)*so .we get **after dividing both sides**:-     ->       Load <- equals              --                        ->          ====            ---->         equalizes into      -->             ==>                [ ]---------->[empty]\r",

        " empty truck together already weigh 3755 pounds. This means you could load another (5000 \u2212 3755) = 1245 pounds without surpassing the weight limitation. Since every box takes up 15 pounds, this leaves space enough for only \\( \\frac{1245}{15} \\) or exactly 83 boxes when rounded down. Thus, it\u2019s safe if the worker loads just under 83 boxes into the cargo area before setting out across the bridge; loading all but one would still result in less than full capacity. Therefore, the precise count\u2014without going past capacity \u2014can comfortably include adding ten fewer packages as well , thus making sure the shipment doesn't fall foul of the structural integrity restrictions set forth . To summarize briefly : considering safety first prioritized above any financial concerns during times like these helps ensure long term sustainability!",

That mean exactly **83** whole numbers or packages fit within the safe limits leaving no extra unused as far as weights concern. Therefore when rounded down you get just below max allowed hence ,the possible most amount without any chance of breaking something along way using the closest feasible full integer underneath the actual fractional value could safely allow passing .
