To find out how much additional annuity payment (over original) we can get using this clause when retiring before age required according to plan rules it would mean calculating how long the worker stays employed fewer than expected. Here let\u2019s assume the standard working life expectancy as being around another average work duration i.e., remaining time until normal retirement age ~ 20 years lesser instead of full term period ie, 20 years mentioned above making marcy worked only till approx past middle point(~10 yrs earlier than expectation).

        " 20 years ($2,500) plus halfway through another period (i.e., after 25 years), since it would increase by another percentage every subsequent tenure. Therefore, we find out this increased incremental part as follows: Since these increments occur over periods of 10 years, hence one such periodic occurrence falls within 5 years time span which ends when she quits i.e., after 30 years working duration; therefore, only count three whole cycles of increment [since ((Years_Working(after joining))//Period)]=((30 Years)-(20 Years+half a decade)=[30-(20+5)=]=(<<Here>>)). Hence apply [(Increment*Number Of Cycles)+Base Annual Value]=[$(Annual Pension)*NoOfCycle]+[(Percentage of base annually*(Total Number of completed years during employment)/ Tenure Duration Factor]*Tenure Period=[$50,(3*$10)+($2,500*([(YEAR)(PARTITION OF TENURE])=$50+(3*$10)+($2,500*({{Year|div:(YEAR->employer)}}/${{tenure | div (Employment Year)|round(-}}))))).
