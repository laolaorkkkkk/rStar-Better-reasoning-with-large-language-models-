When Josh spent additional amount (repair), it would increase its current value too i.e., Original investment multiplied by percentage growth over what was initially invested (=($130,000)*(1+150%)). By calculating above expression result comes out same as 'x*1.5'; which means new house valuation equals old investment times factor=original_investment*(growth rate)=$130,000*1.5=$195,000. To figure out profits one needs to subtract initial investments from newly calculated property\u2019s worth using formula Profit=(New Value)-OriginalInvestment=$(195,000-$130,000).

It means that even though he spent quite a bit on improvements during rehabilitation, ultimately these efforts didn\u2019t pay off since housing values rose dramatically overnight due to changes outside their control such as supply constraints caused largely because interest rates dropped suddenly causing prices soaring almost double quicker than anticipated resulting lower demand which consequently reduces affordability further driving up land costs forcing sellers like joshustoff market priced far above replacement level thus limiting returns potential especially if new taxes arise affecting cash flow positively impact homeowner equity negatively compromising its inherent attractiveness while also increasing carrying loan expenses related maintenance including insurance premiums etc all leading eventually here!

But technically speaking looking through numbers alone according your math calculations I\u2019m afraid no one makes significant returns off residential real estate without considerable risks involved. You may opt NOT consider such cases & instead focus purely academically while understanding concepts related potential gains/losses during property trading activities among others!

However, Josh sold the renovated property not just as any item but as real estate asset whose original worth ($80,000). Despite adding up significant improvement through renovations amounting to about half its initial market valuation; hence profits can\u2019t directly computed based solely upon combined purchase & upgrade outlay because only consideration here would be actual sales revenue minus associated selling/upgrade charges. We first find this increase over what was spent : Cost Spent(Total)=Initial+Repairs=Renovations Expense=>$130k-$120k=$10k Profit made thus far doesn't account future maintenance needs yet though still substantial enough considering typical residential living periods extend beyond short term investments without drastic disruptions expected otherwise\u2013making sense when looking ahead past these stages too! So ultimately we need one formula calculating both gain elements separately\u2014first subtract respective components together before comparing gains against losses across time frames using equations combining all factors affecting specific cases individually related ones respectively .

        " repair costs for a total investment of 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 . Subtract this amount invested from what it sold for (the increase calculated earlier)to determine profits, resulting into  120,000 - 130,000 which equals negative 10,000 or minus ten thousand USD loss since he spent almost as much trying buy and fixing up houses than selling price was worth. Hence, we can see that instead of making any kind of net positive return through these actions, Josh actually ended up taking back about half of all original funds when calculating returns against outgoings vs sales revenues thus suggesting such strategy here being not particularly fruitful financially speaking based upon calculations provided..

Hence, the increase amount due to repair was ($80,000 x 1) / 3 )=$26,667 approximately if we consider only monetary values and not actual property valuation factors such as inflation or market conditions . We subtract this figure from our initial investment sum: Profit equals Sales Value \u2013 Initial Cost; thus, His profits come out to around $$120,000(final sales value)-$130,000(initial costs)= $-1000.$ However , since positive returns signify net earnings instead than losses during ventures like real estate speculation considering tax benefits etc., one could argue herein favoring potential appreciations beyond mere raw dollar figures..

Note this isn\u2019t your \u201ccost\u201d, because it doesn\u2019t take into account the increase due to resale (as discussed later). Add up both numbers \u2013-$130,000+$0=$130,000 Find what percentage of this amount represents as we know increases made through renovations generally yield about half of appreciation gained via real estate cycles plus time factors etc.. We see here though our original question specifically mentioned \u201dincrease\u201d rather than simply saying \u201cvalue\u201d. Calculate potential sell/flip equity gain using known property tax rate or average local prices vs asking listings before calculating any markup factor based upon location within town / state area sizes & types being compared against similar properties nearby listed houses usually go higher values along those lines if comparing across wider regions consider adding additional multipliers related directly proportional differences like distance away form job centers transportation links schools health services proximity hospitals crime rates neighborhood population percentages income data median home sales averages yearly growth figures vacancy rents per unit expenses associated fees maintenance cleaning energy waste disposal landscaping insurance building codes zoning requirements mortgage interest savings programs options financing facilities support structures equipment safety measures accessibility compliance regulations permits construction schedules project management resources consultants developers contractors architectures interior design exterior architecture interiors decorative furnishings fixtures lighting color schemes textiles soften fabrics linens wallpapers carpet padding curtain rod blinds shades draperies window treatments skylights sunlight reflections glazing glass pane sills surfaces plaster paint varnishes lacquers stains coat finish adhesives solvents paints brush roller spray guns sealing gluing bond welding fastening nails screw drives bolts hammers axes saw hands tools tool boxes workbenches machines engines electrical generators motors turbines diesel fuel oil lubricants hydraulics batteries electrodes cables conductors transformers capacitors coils inductance resistors transistors switch contacts terminal strips busbars magnet wire resistance circuits diodes semiconductors photores",
        " states the increase was 150%, which means it doubled (a common way to understand percentages), so we calculate this as follows: Original Price ($80,000) \u00d7 Percentage Increase (2 or 'double'). Therefore, the new value would become twice $80,000 equaling $160,000. To find out the overall cost of property including repair costs minus selling prices i.e., Profit; Total Cost includes Purchase Value plus Repair Cost equals $80,000 + $50,000 equals $130,000. Selling Price here refers to Final Property\u2019s worth equalling $160,000 post renovation/repairs. Hence calculating all three components results into Profit being calculated using formula \u2013 Profit= Revenue+Cost\u2013Expenses . Substituting values we get following calculation :Profit=(FinalPropertyWorth)+(PurchasePrice)-((RepairValue))Substitution yields:Profit=$160,000+$80,000-$50,000Equivalenty computes to:$240,000-$50,000Total Net Proceedings finally turnsout to$190,000. Thus our conclusion based on calculations demonstrates if one interprets these data accordingly resultant gain through investment comes up around $190,000 thus providing suitable insightful interpretation regarding profits realised via undertaking ventures such as remodelling projects within properties held.

That results into approximately$182,000 as this result represents post incremental sale or selling price. Hence find out what was spent initially it totals up to $(cost)+($repair); therefore resulting in around $130,000 .Find Profit difference subtracting purchase expenditure against sales income; so if we subtract these amounts,$182,000-$130,000=$52,000 thus finally present your conclusion stating 'profit'. Thus profited him nearly about $. So ,the accurate output would be :Profitted almost by.$52,000.",

Calculate Profit which would be SellingPrice minus (Purchaseprice + CostOfRepairs). Substitute values we know into this formula We get: SalesProfit=FinalValue-( Purchase Price + COST OF REPAIRS)=$155,000 -( 80,000 + 50,000 ).
