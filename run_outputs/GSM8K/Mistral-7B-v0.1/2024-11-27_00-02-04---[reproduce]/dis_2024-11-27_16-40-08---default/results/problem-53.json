Subtract this amount from $360 , multiplied by four ($40 ) which would mean I need calculate eighty percent (.8x$40=$32). Multiply it again so you get twenty thousand forty cents(or just $.8x4=$32); since we used all possible digits before finding zeroes, move them one place over so it becomes thirty two dollars($32)for Four Car Tires per hour or $(.)8cents=.eight cents($8/hours)(dollars)). Add both numbers together because these amounts represent values being calculated using addition while keeping their quantities constant throughout operations involved within calculating prices charged during operation hours performed daily:($.8+.$32+$.).
