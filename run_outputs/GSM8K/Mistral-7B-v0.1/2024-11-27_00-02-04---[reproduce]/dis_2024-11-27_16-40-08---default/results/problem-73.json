Since one needs neither accurate timeline details surrounding actual payment intervals along wihtout any knowledge around whether said interval happens hour daily etc., using straightforward yet effective methods leads us toward finding totals via summing principle values according proportioning relevant figures against common base cases involved such multiples periods divided amongst whole quantities observed during observation cycles themselves thus making clear distinctions exist concerning various contributors including possible partial sums derived thereby resulting further potential savings while still taking account other influences like external market trends / demand fluctuations potentially alter costs directly linked thereto hence creating greater variety among cost drivers impact both short terms vis versus longer planning horizons alike providing opportunities maximizing efficiencies achieved through comprehensive strategy evaluations ensuring optimal resource allocations always prioritized accordingly maintain consistent goal alignment regardless varying circumstances faced throughout lifecycle phases respectively applied methodologies considered pertinent towards deliverables accomplished desired outcome realistically feasible sustainably viable under defined constraints stipulations set forth expectancies fulfilled ultimately satisfying respective objectives aligned strategies embraced embody adaptability pragmatism innovative perspectives adopt holistic approach optimizes balancing tradeoffs sought benefits reap returns harvested judiciously yielding tangible value extracted leveraging experience accumulated progressively refining skills honing capabilities advancing competencies mastery pursuing excellence aspiring success achievements celebrated collective efforts rewarding contributions acknowledged celebration shared accomplishments rejoiced moments cherished relationships nurtured bonds strengthened friendships fostered camaraderie appreciated collaboration collaborators valued support extended gratitude expressed sentiments conveyed warmth received generosity kindness shown gracious regard reciprocity manifested beneficial exchange facilitated favorable conditions enabled positive environments created conducive spaces encouraged cooperation engaged participation elicited productivity increased output boosted efficiency enhanced performance improved results attained goals met deadlines satisfied commitments kept promises upheld trust built confidence assured quality controlled standards maintained discipline enforced regulation implemented governance",

From previous calculation we know Shelia initially spent \\$765 inclusive of the installation fee, however because the question asks what she would spend overall without considering payment periods or division into individual contributions across these periods which might require further details such as repayment plan etc., our earlier computation still holds true hence no action required here either way but ensuring understanding; if someone wants exactly breakdown over three consecutive months just divide evenly thus making every third part equivalent i.e.: \\frac{TotalCost}{NumberOfMonths} ; simplifying leads us towards finding out amounts due individually during any specific period like 'X'.

You multiplied price individually rather than considering entire purchase amount plus accumulated extra charges due over time owing importance towards collective expenses encountered during purchasing decisions affect future budget planning needs help correct understanding principles regarding single vs compounded scenarios involving discounts etc could better address practical situations efficiently when preparing financial plans",

Divide because find \u201cone third\u201d . 2 % means dividing the original price ($150) by [tex] \\frac{1}{3} [/tex]. When you divide something once all you\u2019re doing is finding \u2018the whole times another half.\u2019 Thus we multiply the initial amount($150), by itself twice over; meaning square rooting before cube operation.( i.e., [(square_root)(initial)]^[cube]). Since squaring multiplies your input value by its opposite sign(i.e.: if starting point was positive \u2013 result becomes negative); but cubic function retains positivity as long as the previous computation didn\u2019t go past zero\u2014so our outcome would still hold a constant direction\u2013positive even following through negatively influenced calculation!
