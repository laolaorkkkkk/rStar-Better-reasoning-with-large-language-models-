Since it only took one supply pack outlaying $10 initially, Charlie spent no extra funds here\u2014it was just part of this initial expense used up completely making these additional ten candles without any further investment required. Therefore when all twenty candles sold together come off shelves; Revenue equals sales price times quantity equalling [$2(20)]=$40 received back minus Cost Price=[$1($x)+$10]equals $-[totalcost]. As we know our Profit Equation looks like P=[R(TR)-C TC], thus substituting values into formula becomes:-P =([$2\u00d720]-$40,$1 \u00d7 unknown weight)=(-$20,-weight\u2217$1), solving above system gives us weight=-2lbs.,which doesn\u2019t hold true because negative weights cannot exist physically neither logistically nor economically speaking!

Finally Net Profit= Revenue \u2013 Supplies Cost so our resultant function becomes Value=(Total earned)-$(total spent on materials)= $(40-$20.) It therefore totals up to $20.. However since only choices exist within whole numbers or tens; Our best option here being choice b worth twenty thousand one hundred sixty seven cents otherwise known simply as 'dollars'. Thus rounding down leaves us '$20.' And because you asked me specifically not provide anything beyond my last digit I shall stop before reaching '. . ..\" Hence Final ",

Given that all these items sold out exactly as planned we need only find revenue(total sale price) minus expenses to calculate its profits earned. Expense includes everything which was spent before making any kind or sales such like buying raw materials needed while earning profit through their resale. Cost per item produced here depends mainly upon quantity purchased but also other factors involving production process efficiency etc..

To get this value you divide initial input into produced units like below [[(.5*.33)=$.16]].

P/E ratio formula : Proft Margin ration = CPT / SMP ,Profit margin ratio also called proft %, means %of profits over unit sold .Calculated using this simple equation !!! This helps business owners identify weak spots such as higher production or operating costs compared with their competitors who charge less than them but still maintain reasonable pricing based on market rates.

This means instead charging $2 here actually charged amount is slightly lesser than calculated above such as $.99 while being very close still not considering other business expenses like labor this equation might vary widely yet practically speaking assuming all profits went direct towards covering up losses associated within itself.. But even taking initial assumption lets continue ahead though... First determine quantity involved ; To create enough material necessary requires us finding approximate values based off data provided earlier thus knowing approximately when working forward both ways without needlessly wasting valuable time through guesswork!
