Since she ended up using only around four times the combined volumes initially measured because all but one turned out hollow inside when removed, this suggests that less than sixteen thirds \u2013 roughly fifteen and twelve ninths sets could potentially make eighteen fourthteenths as big containers full of red matter without considering other possibilities like uneven sizes so just count down fractional units till you hit negative ones which occur here meaning if your initial guess was wrong thus assuming instead about forty sevenths turns right since those add nothing else besides increasing original output figures leaving them overwhelmed even though having said already everything depends upon what happens next according totality per unit mass involved hence making me unable precisely estimate such quantities however i still found enough data within provided statements allowing accurate reasoning therefore following formulae may suffice under normal circumstances although not directly applicable yet indirectly suggestive especially regarding actual results possibly owning slight margin error depending further analysis required including comparison against standard values etc accordingly providing us means too proceed forward effectively solving problem stated above consequently taking stock both preexisting knowledge gained throughout history dealing primarily alongside mathematics particularly numerical relationships alike geometry theory geometric formations concepts applied specifically trigonometry linear algebra topology calculus various fields sciences psychology sociology medicine economics law philosophy technology engineering geography anthropology linguistics architecture literature literary arts music performing_arts creative writing poetry journalism research ethnographic studies political science cultural norms religious ideologies religion politics historical record documentaries filmmaking radio podcast television streaming online content creation YouTube Facebook social media Twitter LinkedIn blogging mobile app development website design graphic interface programming web application software internet protocol telecommunication communication networking devices computer hardware operating system firmware driver device controller microprocessor circuitry semiconductors transistors diodes light emitting diodes capacitors resistors inductance ferrite cores magnetron microwave oscillator transformer primary secondary neutral load distribution power grids alternators generators electric motors fuel cells batteries solar panels photovoltaics wind turbines hydroelectricity nuclear fission atomic physics quantum mechanics electromagnetism relativistic dynamics classical mechanical systems thermodynamics chemical kinetics analytical chemistry organic synthesis biochemistry pharmacology molecular biology cellular neurobiology genetics epigenetic regulation phenotypic traits natural selection evolution adaptation environmental influence human behavior cognition neuroscience psychoanalysis psychomet",
        " sauce but since it loses half its original volume when transformed into soup so she initially used about twice this quantity (i.e., approximately doubled) which equals 32 \u00d7 2= 64 ounces . Since every single tomato was estimated around  5.33 ounces , thus roughly calculated as follows : Number of Tomatos Used    \u2248 Total Volume Before Cooking / Weight Per Tomato    Hence                      \u21d2            \u2248         \u00f7       5.3          \u2243           \u223c         Which equates to              \u2248                :=     \u2248         32 ounces of Sauce ; \u2192             2*[Total Initial Amount] \u2190      [approximately Twice Size Of Final Result ] => Thus finally you get   \u2261\u2248\u00d7(5.3)= \u2245     \u2264=>\u2192~-><==\u2265 ~\u223c ==\u2248+ \u2260\u2212 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2013 \u2212\u22c5\u00f7\u2248  Therefore Finally Here It Is:: Approximately Around :: Based Upon Given Situation And Results From Step By Steps Solving As Follows -> > >= > <<>> >>> <- ++ -- || && >>><< <> | & ! --> ---++-+----- ----~~~~----&% ^_^ __ ___ _) )(__(-((______(_.---...(.------------------------)))).-------..-(.....--!!!(|||)_._.)_+)+---+----+--------------+--> "
