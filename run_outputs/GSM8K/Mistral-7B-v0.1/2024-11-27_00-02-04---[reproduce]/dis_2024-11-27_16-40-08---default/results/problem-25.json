Next identify individual prices; it's stated that four apples together would cost [(4)*(0.5)]=[$2]. Deduce these amounts so we subtract them too resulting $23-$2 leaves another remainder of $21 specifically available to cover any additional orders like the mentioned undisclosed quantity of various pizza boxes priced currently per unit as $.50 or \"$[/dollar]\" each. To know exactly about count ('quantity') of such containers purchased divide what remains using division operation ($21/$8). Consequently your results showcase $\\frac{21}{8}$ yielding roughly . But since you can\u2019t possibly buy fragments ($\\frac{a part not full}}{b parts}) hence conclude without dividing quantities into fractions or decimals but rather complete whole numbers only\u2014the most logical choice here considering real world conditions while shopping indicates buying no less than entire bundled packages.
