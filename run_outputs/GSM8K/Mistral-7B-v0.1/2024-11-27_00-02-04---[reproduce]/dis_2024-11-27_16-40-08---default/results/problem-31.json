        " because it seemed like fun or could help them improve estimation skills rather than due necessity. Each person provides different calculations based on varying methods (half plus twenty, percentage increase), showcasing diversity in approach while dealing with basic arithmetic operations related specifically to whole numbers within realistic quantities observed commonly found such as candies in jars/bowls here assumed being 'jellybeans'. It helps strengthen not only mathematical knowledge but also teamwork aspect along when working together towards common goals though possibly misleading results sometimes occur if everyone doesn\u2019t adhere strictly onto rules set during discussions ensuring accurate estimations required prior before starting tasks involving collective measurements aiming precision accuracy beyond individual efforts alone thus necessitating collaboration coordination among group members effectively using established formulas guidelines principles logical reasoning critical thinking decision making communication clear understanding mutual respect courtesy kindness empathetic supportiveness compassionate concern considerate listening attentive engagement comprehensive analysis thorough research effective problem solving creative innovative approaches solution design optimization implementation quality assurance reliability safety security sustainability environmental conservation ethical conduct professionalism accountability responsibility personal development lifelong learning growth mindset continual improvement adaptation flexibility versatility adaptable adjust skill enhancement training exercises practice experience reflection feedback learnings apply insights lessons learned improvements made necessary changes needed prevent errors mistakes fault confusion avoid ambiguities uncertainties risks consequences mitigate potential disaster ensure success outcome happy customers satisfied clients appreciation express gratitude recognition awards ceremonies congratulations celebrations special occasions gifts certificates plaques trophies medals badges ribbons hats mugs coffee cups stamps postcards thank you cards letters notes greeting cards invitations programs events parties gatherings social media posts videos blog entries podcast episodes book chapters documentaries films movies musical concerts performances shows exhibitions festivals fair trade products supporting artisanal craftsmakers handicraft sellers cultural preservation customary traditions local communities indigenous peoples traditional practices unique identities rich folklore diverse cultures worldwide societies global citizens humanitarian aid charitable organizations nonprofits grassroots activist movements political advocacy lobbying pressure groups civil rights campaign justice system legal representation defense pro bono public interest litigation corporate governance shareholder responsibilities fiduciary duties board directors committees advisory panels audit oversight regulatory standards transparency",
        " estimated twice as high (twice as high means double), so it becomes 80*2=160. Adding all these together we get :  80+160+(40+20) = 80+160+60 = 300 . Since there are three people who made estimations ,the mean estimate would therefore be calculated like this :    (Estimate 1 + Estimate 2 + Estimate 3 ) / Number_of_estimations   =     (80+160+60)/3   =     30/3 =   100 Therefore, Their average guess was about 100 jellybeans.(Note: This question isn\u2019t consistent with its description; according to calculations if 'second person thinks twenty percent higher', I thought estimation process can include such details too.)(Revised "
