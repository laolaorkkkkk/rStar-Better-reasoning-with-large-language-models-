Multiply this result by the capacity of fuel held when full including additional driving as calculated earlier using known values such as total available volume minus what\u2019s currently remaining multiplied by efficiencies previously established. Hence perform calculation ((12*25)-(4*25))=<<12*(25)=300>>300. This represents possible maximum range if no further stops until empty gauge reached hence multiply results obtained till previous calculations thus((300-(4*25))) equates to <<300-(4*25)=200>>200.
