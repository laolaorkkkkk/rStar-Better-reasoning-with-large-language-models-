As such every unused dollar comes as one whole unwanted sold Lego set ; hence no additional legos can disappear or appear during transaction process(as long as everything goes as planned). This means only parts/portions existed previously but weren\u2018t actually owned initially! They may come under various forms depending upon your situation like being borrowed , stolen etc., therefore I won\u2019t consider those here because without proper context its too ambiguous!. However considering basic scenario according question description.. We could assume these remaining amounts meant exactly half numbers since nobody usually counts fractional units unlike counting full ones when dealing currency matters\u2026which implies somehow around...half dozen perhaps~or maybe even less than ..it depends entirely per circumstance surrounding both sides involved within case analysis !!!!

To find out how few legos remains unpicked we need subtract initial value(that stands equaly divided among remaining legs) , here being ($$195/$7)$^which stays around $$28 per set($$).
