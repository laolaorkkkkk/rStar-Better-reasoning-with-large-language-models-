Given no indication about changes during these periods, charge remains consistent throughout both halves henceforth. To determine the second period cost decrease due to reduced pricing (10%) apply discount calculation formula [(original price)*(percentage reduction)] /100%. Thus ($140*(10)/100) equals $14 representing annual saving via said arrangement since applied twice over subsequent similar span.
