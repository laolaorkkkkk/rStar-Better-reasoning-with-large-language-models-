Let\u2019s correct this misunderstanding; since their target average speed isn't influenced directly but maintain over all sections together or combined. This leads us back towards calculating overall required journey time instead using individual times before walking evenly through each section as well while not taking into account previously calculated speeds when recalculating them based off new input information like further distances apart. What matters here aren't so about already being behind schedule due slowness yet ahead still having one segment untravelled outwith knowing any specific details concerning its length except maybe just hintedly indicating full pathway coverage without revealing additional particulars regarding either said segments nor indeed actual timings allocated during traverse unless you prefer me assuming random possible allocations otherwise known nothing beyond mere conjecture made solely purely along guesslines possibly drawing upon assumptions potentially drawn straight away forthcoming direct lineal sequence likely correlative sequential pattern alignment perhaps best fitting most aptest probable outcome conceivably plausible estimate presuming no explicit facts supplied present themselves readily yieldable henceforth permitting informed deduction derivation discernment deductive reasoning determination decision dictated decided decisions determined deterministic destined denouement discrepancies dividing dualities diverging destinies decisively depict distinct directions dispelled doubts dissolved desolation demonstrated defiance definitiveness delineating dynamics driving development deferred developments delayed delivery diminished duration diversity divided dimensions dissected disparaging differences demarcating diverse deliberations differentiating dichotomies divisional deviations disagreements debunk deceit deliverance delay differentiation distribution dynamic divisions devastation duplicity drawback designated disposition deviation delivered discovery diverted division distributing dialectical distinction despite difference decreased doubt disappearance detention depth derived dedication dissipated debate damage diligent digestion dignified dogmatic dreamdriven disputes dwindling duality dispersed disturbances dubiously defined disturbances distributed destructuring drudgery dues downturn duress dreadful damages daunting dismissals deadlock declaration dangerous dalliancing dispatch divorce domiciled documentation donned doubling down drive drove doorkeepers domaind dominion dotage doubled drew duplicates driven dwell dimmer dimension deep disappointment declared denied dashed departure dawn daily demand demolishing dozen design demanded designs depart",

Therefore our equation stands like such; Speed=(Total Distance)/(total Time). Plugging values we shall see that Marissa needs to cover the last mile within .97hrs (this converts back to around 57 mins.), therefore if s represents the required SPEED herewith..the formula goes thusly...  5miles /hours = Total/Time ..which simplifies further downwards until getting something similar to just say\u2026Speed=.remainingDistance./Required_time....In other words ....`SPeed = 1Mile/.(.97Hour)` ...
