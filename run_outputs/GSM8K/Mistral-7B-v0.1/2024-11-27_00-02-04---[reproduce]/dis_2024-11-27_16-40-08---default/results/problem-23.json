        " candle stops burning at 5:00 PM. Calculate duration of melting or time interval based on these times \u2013 so subtract start time (1:00 PM) from stopping time (5:00 PM). This equals four hours spent actively melting because 5 minus 1 equals 4. Determine rate which provides information about what happens per unit of measure over one single measurement cycle; here this would refer to the amount melted away per clock hour i.e., cmm/hr which is provided as being equal too '2 cm'. Multiply determined units measured along pathway (cm shortened due to heat), such numbers found within initial data set ('cmm', above noted at position of '2'), multiplied into computed temporal progress indicator expressed via standardized numerical scale derived during preliminary evaluation phase -- equalling quantity known collectively termed outcome variable henceforth required upon request completion thus prompting further calculation using previously established formula governing current situation involving specified resources involved thereby arrives resulting figure denoted below... Four! Hence, if we multiply the height reduced per hour (which is two centimeters) by the length of time (four hours), we get twenty centimeters reduction in size. Therefore, our equation becomes Hours Melted X Height Reduction Per Hour Equals Total Diminution Size From Start Time.

        " need to calculate the elapsed hours when the candle was lit. Calculate using subtraction method: subtracting initial value (1) from final value (5). This calculates into 4; so four hours passed during which the candle melted continuously. Determine the rate per unit interval. As identified earlier, the speed at which the wax disappears equals seven cm/hour because one hour sees eight percent decrease relative to size. Compute amount changed or alteration over all units as determined above i.e., multiply the change_rate parameter(centimeter/hr), times duration variable=elapsed seconds*. Translate this computation process back into plain English formulation without mathematical symbols like multiplication sign '\u00d7'.

Here my calculations indicate roughly something like this: Initially starting height h=5m(cm), melt speed v=-2/hhr (=2x). Total duration dt=(start_time+end_times)=[6pm-(noon)]=[5pm-(noontime)-hour]. Thus our formula becomes f(dt)->(-v*dt)/w ; w=(1e-5)(T); therefore ~[-(velocity)*(duration/(width))](here width stands independently ) =~ [-c'(p),(i')&k,(g')[~[(a^f)^b; c^(z)']; [c', o; n]][o'; b]+([r']^(m'); k*(n)]; [(u%l)&q' &y']; (j'-w)); .

        " so over 4 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), the amount melted would be 2 cm/hour \u00d7 4 hours = 8 centimeters. Therefore, if you subtract these 8 centimeters from the original length of the candle before any was burnt, this operation represents exactly what happens when we calculate the remaining part or height of the unburnt portion using subtraction which yields 'subtracting'. Hence applying real life contextual understanding makes answering such problems directly easier without mathematical calculations especially elementary ones as per your instruction constraint i.e., focusing lesser numbers only rather than providing exact arithmetic formulas required usually used while solving similar mathematic equations. Nevertheless mathematically speaking; assuming X meters long initial size of the candle ; hence ,the new length Y post four hours equals Initial Size minus quantity diminished through time due to rate of change thus equation reads as :X \u2013(rate_of_change)\u00d7time=Y .
