However if you assume he works continuously all seven days of the week without taking any breaks or using any specific pattern like 'three gym visits spread throughout different weeks,' you calculate simply multiply daily distance covered i.e.,   180 m*(days worked)     Thus assuming nonstop training across whole weeks regardless no break period; You get::    180*7 = <<180*7=1260>>1260 meters .

Thus if you add another KM onto what already exists , its still just over four miles less but lets say about three plus fourth(because)so when calculating distance based off time instead consider length not velocity because both terms refer independently meanwhile adding lengths together could alter results depending upon relative speeds;therefore distances become harder while also making everything slower!
