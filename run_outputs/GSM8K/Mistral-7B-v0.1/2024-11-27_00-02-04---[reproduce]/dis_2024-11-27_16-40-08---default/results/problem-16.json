        " any assumptions made. Both distances (westward and northward) could change depending upon whether one or another starts going before the other direction. Given all these considerations mentioned above; we know initially both start point coordinates would coincide since they depart together. However, their individual paths diverge due south/north motion resulting into differences but not difference in overall lengths as per question. Based on this information calculate which train goes further when considering magnitude(distance). To find out if Train_A went farther than Train_B despite having identical itineraries just remember : Total Distance Coverage equals Magnitude of Displacement . Calculate displacements using Pythagorean Theorem ; D^2=X^2+Y^2 Here X represents east-west movement & Y denotes North South Movement Thus , Might look like below Trains Go East West Northeast / North South  \tTrain_A     \t    Start Point         _________     __|                       |__End Position_____(West)=(-80 m)(East)= (+80m),(North)= (-150 )               End Net Displace-> sqrt{ [Dx]2+[ Dy ]2 } ->sqrt {[-80+80]\u00b2 + [-150]\u00b2} ...this computes zero because the E&W moves cancel Each Time Square root becomes Zero here ......but ! We Know...total straight line dist can\u2019t become zero This inconsistency comes down to assumption Made earlier....that no single train moved while others move along ..we assumed wrong! Instead let Assume First One Starts Journey Along Direct Line Straight Path BUT Next Day Begin Changing Course TO THE NEORTH Suddenly!...disables Option C Whereas Second Train Had Completed All Previous Plan And Just Begun With Its Final Itinerary Hence Conclusion Follows Only Correct Options Are Left Out Of Original Four Choices As Analysis Proved.....option only available Is NOT part of original set !! hence its inclusion appears incorrect!! thus concludes correct analysis eliminates option c!!!
