These leftover candies needs to go into packages containing only 2 per piece/container. This means we need divide our new subtotal amount (i.e., 28 candy bars), thus making it equal upfront or before solving as well identifying what this division looks like mathematically; therefore dividing both sides by their respective common denominator which was revealed earlier when breaking down those items individually via steps mentioned previously namely \u201cTotal Lollipops\u201d & \u201dConsumption\u201d. Based upon previous discussions about sharing among groups while ensuring none remain without place during said action(sharing). Hence doing further math accordingly based solely off values already established throughout discourse results shown below respectively:-   Number_of_Candies / CandieperBag .

Divide totals among all containers using whole numbers so no leftover items remain until exhausted which means you use integer division here since fractional parts mean incomplete sets according to instructions.

As per this question it was stated that each group contains 2 Lollipops only; therefore divide those resulting ten packages using just these two numbers(divisors).

When all items placed together form complete sets like this problem tells us above when dealing wiith such amounts ,we get what mathematicians call factors . Hence using divisors factorial numbers times their respective amount gets counted meaning simply put counting without regrouping because nothing remained uncountable even though still available enough quantity too! That being said let's apply our rules here : First takeaway; taking care not forgetting any single ones before grouping makes things simple\u2013just donut\u2019 em while doing math hahaha!!
