Since x represents what Harold sold(the smaller quantity), Harold sold 8000 copies while Marilyn sold 10*8000 equaling  80000 sales altogether.

However since M~marilyn\u2019 s actual recorded value exceeds H because of integer constraints involved ,the best way here would just subtract multiples till getting whole numbers within realistic bounds...i suggest iterative subtraction or solving directly via trial division!

Thus resulting statement can stand completed hence providing all information required alongwith making clear enough context around variables involved thereby ensuring proper understanding related topic discussed amongst users including future participants who might also stumble across query regarding same subject matter area being tackled right before encountering presented challenge scenario based upon provided dialogue thread involving specific personas mentioned engaging within thematic exchange taking place amid interlocutors interactively engaged sharing varied individual perspectives towards addressal strategies associated primarily pertaining direct implications arising post consumption activity initiated owing certain prevalent circumstances influencing respective course taken visa versa depending solely off personal viewpoints held whilst participating respectively partaking actively inclusive contributing essential components underpinning entire framework designed structurally crafting intended purpose aim centered toward particular goal achievement set forth prior time frame commencing establishment formation procedure undertaken consequently followed subsequently subsequent occurrence prompt reaction stimulus acting triggered reactions induced emissions responses generated cascading effects ripple effect propagation cycle perpetuated continuance inherent process characteristics ultimately culminating collective sum aggregative totality derived accumulative compilation summarization concludes overall quantitative measurement metric computed numerically representing approximate numerical magnitude dimension physical quantity assessed dimensions spatial extent delineating boundaries established surrounding entity considered assessment criteria applied throughout evaluational proceedings executing requisite computations performed calculation execution methodologies employed analytical techniques implemented theoretical frameworks expounded practical applications demonstrated experimental results obtained achieved findings synthesized consolidated data integrated processed interpret encompass encapsulating overarching discourse disseminated effectively efficiently impart knowledge comprehensive grasp acquired conceptually fundamentals reinforced intellectual appreciation heightened awareness fostering deeper insight expanded perspective widen scope understand breadth reach beyond mere superficial level cultivate curiosity propel progress facilitate evolution inspire innovation elevate creativity fuel imagination ignite passion drive motivation empower aspire achieve dream realize ambition attain vision become reality"
