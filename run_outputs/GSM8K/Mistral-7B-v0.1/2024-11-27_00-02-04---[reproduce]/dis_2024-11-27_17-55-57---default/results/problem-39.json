        " Dana walks. Since it's not mentioned directly, we could assume Dana\u2019s walking speed would correspond proportionately when applied backward (halving) relative to her skipping or running speeds. Therefore, calculate Dana's walking speed using our previous statement about her skipping speed being halved compared to running (i.e., Running Speed= Skipping Speed*2). Hence, Dana\u2019s walking speed equals Skip Speed/2 i.e., 3mph / 2 , equaling to roughly .75 mph. Calculate Dana's maximum distance traveled while jogging within these conditions over the allotted six hours period spent. Given that just two thirds of this duration was used to jog \u2013 resulting into approximately ~4hours(out of the original six), you multiply its associated velocity (.75x4)=approximately~3 Miles Coverage due to Walking activities.(Note: Round up any decimals produced because physical distances cannot exist partially.) Lastly deduce the overall maximal possible distance traversable throughout said timeline based off the combined results achieved via either Jogging & Walking respectively across those same span outlined initially along Six Hour Period.-Add resultant Travel Accumulations obtained through both exercise regimes previously computed (approx.=~3+the remaining amount derived whilst Ran during unavailable interval periods)-Given that such quantity equates around seven distinct divisions before round numbers begin manifesting themselves again.(For better precision apply exact values instead ).

To calculate distances covered we use Distance= Speed \u00d7 Time formula. Given that Traffic segment was completed first followed up next immediately afterwards when starting early enough morning until reaching optimal driving point , hence no delay experienced here despite being longer route taken compared initially scheduled ones mentioned earlier since neither took place till later due largely increased commute length stemming primarily off reduced effective average speeds resulting partly owing greatly elevated vehicular flow thus slowdown across both directions albeit predominantly heavier eastward towards downtown core areas though occasionally still present westbound too sometimes especially latter sections near larger employment centers mainly located north side city limits outside its immediate vicinity .

Similarly, when it comes to walking over the remaining two years (= 6 - 2), she covers  4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 mile. Hence altogether, within six hours, taking into account both cycling and strolling, Dana could make distances covering up to    24 + 24=<<24+24=48>>48 miles. The answer is: 48.",
