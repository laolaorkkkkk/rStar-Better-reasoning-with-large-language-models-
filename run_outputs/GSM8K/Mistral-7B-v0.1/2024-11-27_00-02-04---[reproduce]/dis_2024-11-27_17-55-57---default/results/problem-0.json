Identify what fraction these set-aside eggs account for relative to all eggs produced by janets 'ducks'. They represent $\\frac{n}{N}=\\frac{9}{16}$ part of production (where n represents those retained while N stands for overall output). Multiply this ratio against earning potential ($x) to discover annual gain ($\\$y$). Here we calculate as follows $(Earnings)_{Duck} (\\$) \\propto Production_{Duck} (\\text{'eggs')}$.

To determine how much income Janet makes at the farmer's market we need multiply the quantity of goods being sold into their price tagged value. By doing so your equation looks like this ; sales volume times cost equal amount earned thusly ,(9eggs)(2$) .

To find the remaining amount subtract whatever was used from what ever initial supply we begin off starting with; hence ,sixteen(eggs)-seven=nine.(16\u22127)=9.
