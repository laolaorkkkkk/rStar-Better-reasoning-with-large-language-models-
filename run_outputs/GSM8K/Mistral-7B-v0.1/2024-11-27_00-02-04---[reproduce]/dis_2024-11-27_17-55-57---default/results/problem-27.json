Since cartons come packaged only containing multiples of sets equivalent to the individual quantity used which herein equals fifteen, identify these multiple sets required based upon iteration results above; thus  60 servings divided by 15 servings/set = 4 sets or equivalently 4 packets or iterations since we purchase new ones when empty..

        " Therefore, since there are 60 days (which we can assume comprise a full month), this means that Cynthia consumes exactly six cartons worth of ice cream during this period because three times sixty equals ninety which corresponds precisely to twelve cartons but as only whole units count here it becomes logical to use just six entire cartons instead so henceforth what follows assumes these precise quantities: Firstly calculate the price if all food was purchased using wholesale methods, such way would involve multiplying together quantity sold(in litres or grams)with its corresponding unit rate; however due lacking any relevant quantitative data regarding either aspect within our possession thus necessitating employment alternative methodology like direct conversion based primarily upon established rates whilst retaining consideration towards minimizing unnecessary computation complexity alongside ensuring accuracy throughout calculations albeit perhaps sacrificing minor efficiencies along process execution journey thereby keeping mind practical limitations imposed through absence critical numerical variables essential contributing factors under current contextual scenario...

Calculate the cost based on these cartons purchased using multiplication, since we know it costs $4.00/carton; hence multiply 4(Cartons Needed Over Time) by $4(Price Per Carton), leading to an expenditure amounting to $16. Therefore, Cynthia would spend a sum of $16 on Ice Cream Sundaes if purchasing them daily throughout a time span equaling half a year lengthwise. Final ",
