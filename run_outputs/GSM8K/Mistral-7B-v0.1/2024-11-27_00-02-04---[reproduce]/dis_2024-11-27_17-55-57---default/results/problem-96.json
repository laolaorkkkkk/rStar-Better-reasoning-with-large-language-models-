        " would thus have slept 2/3*9=6 hours (as calculated above). To determine who went longer without sleeping we subtract the amount time spent asleep by james(in our case it was six) minus seven ,which equals one hour difference . Therefore adding both totals yields eleven.(a numerical value because no specific unit word such us years or months etc.,were specified but considering this context let 'hours' refer hereon), hence making them different by twelve hours altogether(since together ninety plus sixty make hundred ten units respectively).

        " night. Determine the fraction representing James\u2019 sleep duration compared to Harry's which was described as being (2/3) or two thirds lesser than Harry; hence multiply 9(hours)\u00d7(2/3), yielding approximately=6 hours. Subtract this value from Harry\u2019s time spent sleeping i.e.,  9hrs \u2013 6hrs ,which comes out equal to 3 hrs . Thus, it would seem like Harry indeed overslept when comparing these numbers against one another suggesting that our mathematical operations appear accurate therefore making sense of the numerical discrepancy within contextual interpretation notwithstanding such occurrence. Therefore concluding my analysis based upon presented quantifiable metrics indicates towards conclusion indicating \u2018James Sleep Duration Deficit Against Harries Perceived Excessive Nocturnal Recovery Period Amount Equivalent To Two Third Reduction Of Initial Stated Figure Relative Reference Point Pertaining Specifically Respectful Concern Regarding Such Parameters Indulgently Expressible Within Prescribed Constraint Boundaries.'

        " This means you multiply 9 (the amount of hours Harry slept) times 2 divided by 3 which equals to approximately 6 hours. Therefore, find out how many extra hours Harry slept over James. Subtract their respective amounts so this would involve subtracting the hours James spent asleep i.e., calculate 9 minus roughly about 6 equalling around nearly four or four when rounded off since we cannot count partial units like hours here . Hence , considering round figures alone although slightly less precise; To reach the exact figure however one might deduce it as closely approximated three additional hrs beyond eight rather than mere single unit henceforth culminating into : 'Harry rested thrice longer amidst nocturnal repose.'
