Add up all constant values first according to PEMDAS/BODMAS order since addition (-2) comes before multiplication ((4*125)). 125 - 2 equals 123 because subtraction occurs next due to its precedence over addition when neither parenthesis nor exponents appear. Next multiply inside parentheses which means multiplying '4' by grace\u2019s weight ('125') resulting in forty twenty or eight hundred thirty-two units per hour [given].
