Consequently since those occur over seventeen(in )weeks::the period being under consideration, multiplying them altogether leads us into calculating its cumulative sum i.e.;[](link). Thus concluding we get ((a)-b)/c=(x)=((1.5)*(7)+(3))/2*(4)=[(12)]=<<(1.5*7+(3))/(2*4)=((9.5)*2)=19>>19total hrs dedicated towards relaxation practices across fortytwo(sevenweekperiod)(fournightsperweek).. But you asked about totals taken together not just solely devoted onto screen viewing alone or literature engagement respectively but overall combined engagements encompassing everything mentioned above including leisure pursuits such video gaming alongside other entertainment forms considered previously! So if u want your question rephrased let me know .. Otherwise hopefully answers provided satisfies original inquiry.(",
