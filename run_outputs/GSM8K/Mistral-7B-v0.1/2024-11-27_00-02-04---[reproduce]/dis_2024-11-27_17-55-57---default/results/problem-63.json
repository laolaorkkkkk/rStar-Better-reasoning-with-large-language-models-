That\u2019s just simple math addition; multiply both amounts together using their respective percentages (.9x$140). Finally add back your regular charge ($140) multiplied again by its percentage portion (the remaining quarter); sum these all three values you get the annual cost over time. To find out what the new fee would look like we take $140(.9)=$126/monthly subscrition bill.
