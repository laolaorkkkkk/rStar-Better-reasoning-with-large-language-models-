Therefore , despite having no clear figures provided regarding overall revenue generation over time versus expenses being listed separately likewise mentioned above yet this appears quite similar indeed hence why most businesses tend opt towards smaller sizes initially since larger quantities result into higher overhead fees associated particularly within agricultural industries involving livestock farming thus driving down individual product pricing structures considerably often forcing manufacturers/suppliers themselves also cut back severely otherwise suffer huge losses during periods drought floods etc .

To find out his income when all said & done remember each goes for sale price which tells us $2 per sold piece times quantity made; or ($2)*(total amount)he earns. And finally subtracting Cost($20)-Income(&$x), you get Profit=(&$x-$20). We want this value however...so plugging numbers into our equation above NetProfit=$((2*$20)-$20)=(40-20)= 20$. This means Oliver nets$$20 assuming everything else such as materials stays equal meaning not increasing/decreasing based off production run size.(It may vary slightly depending but most likely close.) . ",
        " Charlie spends $10 to produce these materials (beeswax & wicks) which amounts to twice as costs because it was mentioned 'one pound'. Thus we conclude since this batch yields ten extra candles produced beyond twenty means half another pound would serve here; hence its value stands at approximately $5 making him investing around ~$15 initially. To derive overall earnings through sales Charlie uses eight individual units or items being evaluated ('candles') times their sold price ($2); consequently summing up comes out to equate $(8*2)$=$\\$$16 . Deduction method thus leads us onto subtract our invested amount ($\\$15$) lesser against earned revenues resulting into \\($\\$1$).

When charlies sold all those 20 candles ,he earns $(20.0). We subtract his initial expenditure ($20) thus becoming this as $$20-$20=$0; meaning none or zero profits! The answer is: 0. ",

His net profit would be sixteen dollars(net income), because earnings before tax was sixty (a rounding error occurs when decimals become whole numbers\u2014for example, fifty seven point four cents becomes sixty dollar bills instead.) And since we rounded down here too ($6 not counting itself as being broken into smaller parts it became ten larger ones), subtracting those seventeen leftover tens again results forty three.(six dollars plus thirty three cents)(sixties worth equals ninty eleven less ninety)=$(43.).

        " calculate the initial expense which would include both materials (the beeswax) and tools. That comes out as ($10 per lb.) x (2lb)=$20. But since Charlie charges all customers either individual prices or flat rates regardless of quantity purchased...he only earns extra revenue when someone purchases enough candles individually rather than wholesale orders. Since it costs him exactly $$20 initially before any additional sales occur because everything was accounted into this first transaction/purchase; thus without considering further revenues....his profits cannot increase beyond just covering those original startup fees necessary throughout production phase i..e making products fit market demand etc . Thus leaving us unable accurately predict actual figures unless specifically known amounts sold off postproduction stage(making sure adequate stock isn\u2019t depleted).

        " beeswax yields 10 candles so it needs half (for producing double quantity) which means Charlie spends twice as much supply costs ($10), i.e., $(10*2)=$20 .Subtract this amount spent in buying materials from revenue earned when sold all twenty candles separately one by one, meaning Revenue=NumberOfCandles\\( \\times \\)PriceEach=\\(\\boxed{($2)\\times (20)} =\\color{blue}{",
        " it would require (2*$10) = $20 as supply expenditure. Multiply the quantity sold which is 20 times its sales value i.e., ($2.00)*(20)= $(40).
