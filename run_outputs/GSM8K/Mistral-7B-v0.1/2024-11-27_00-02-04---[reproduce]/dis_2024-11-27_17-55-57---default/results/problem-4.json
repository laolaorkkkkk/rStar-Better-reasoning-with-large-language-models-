        " chickens. Total daily amount fed so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. As every chicken gets three equal parts per day (three small servings), this means each part contains 40 / 20 = 2 cups for all 20 chickens together. That implies one serving costs half as much since it\u2019s divided among sixteen different portions \u2013 or specifically \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) cup apiece for individual animals but we already know these amounts because of our previous arithmetic work above i.e., four times eight make twenty; no math here really needed!

        " cups per chicken over these two meals. Since this represents only half of the daily amount (because it comes out twice), we multiply 40 cups by 2 to find out the full consumption without considering any other variables like time or changes throughout the rest of the day. This results in 40 cups/chicken * 2 times /day = 80 cups needed every day for all 20 birds collectively. Therefore, no additional feed would be necessary during the last meal because the previous quantities account for both known portions equally distributed through Morning and Afternoon sessions. Thus, 'zero' extra servings into the third session ensures fairness as long as distribution remains equal across existing intervals\u2014as specified, which assumes continued uniformity post-afternoon serving phase within normal dietary routine constraints imposed on domesticated animals.

        ", so the chickens get 15 + 25 = 40 cups during those times. Each chicken gets fed twice per day (morning & afternoon), which means this amount needs to be divided equally among all chickens. Since there are 20 chickens, divide evenly: \\( \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\) cups per chicken over these two meals. Because every single one already received both its part of the daily ration before midnight or just past noon depending on when it's readjusted, we know only half remains until later since the third portion would equal exactly what was initially consumed as well (\\( 2 \\, \\text{(per chicken)} \\times 20 \\, \\text{(chickens)} = 40 \\, \\text{cups}\\) delivered; leaving none remaining).

Therefore, since one last serving remains throughout this calculation, it would mean almost all remaining food serves as such a third portion but less than 13\u2154 due to prior consumption being uneven among hens.

This comes about because when we say 'each', what actually means here might imply multiple types combined but since you want exact servings according strictly single unit basis..(such as grain/seed mix), let us assume only Seeds or Grains!

Thus rounded down serves well here leading us to only use the whole services available till reaching required volumes thus **only requiring either just under ~13 additional individual parts** rather than fractions beyond common measurements used when preparing food etc., therefore taking away your previously calculated decimal equivalent thereby resulting essentially into saying ***\"she doesn't actually require these extra partial portions since providing such approximations isn't always precise nor realistic.\"*** Hence concluding considering standard practice instead mathematical calculations hence bringing forth resultant conclusion stating simply & precisely ---`Wendi needed roughly around <=~~~ near about 13+ full sized containers of mixes(servings) but not exactly 13.3`.
