But since these aren\u2019t amounts but percentages asked about... let\u2019s figure out daily differences firstly!  1st Day : Truck -> Car Tread Repair Cost Ratio [(6*$60)/($40)]=.9 when compared against second ratio involving no CAR parts; .9 here implies greater % profits due only because costs differ & amount remains constant over respective vehicle types \u2013 hence \u2018higher revenue.\u2019 Second comparison yields nothing useful though without values assigned thus concluding simply ~\u201cDifference found!\u201d ;-) Finally subtract lower value side dollar figures above again yield difference i.e., ($40).

        " = $360 on Thursday fixing truck tires. And since it costs him only half as much to fix a car tire than fixed one truck wheel ($40 versus $60), charging less means making double amount (from just four people) \u2013 thus every individual still pays twice as much compared to when buying/repairing wheels separately which results into doubling their bill.
