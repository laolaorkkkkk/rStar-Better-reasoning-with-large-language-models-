Let y represent Gerald\u2019s previous best finishing time before any changes \u2013 i.e., Y= G+2 . Next up, since Gerald decreased his personal record finish time via nutrition improvements equating specifically to being '10%' swifter , it suggests that currently Gerald runs around only \u2018G - GR*1/10\u2018 or simply put about `GR=(y-(gross gain))/(0.9)`. As per question requirements herein mentioned above; if Lee takes noteably less amount of time executing said eventuality namely the 'running procedure', so presently recording merely three minutes plus eighteen secs.(i.e. L = P`L=(Y+(gr) ((1/-(10%))) )`).

Hence Lee's timing becomes `(x+2)sec`.

You might want considering revisiting those inputs & maybe clarifying doubts regarding missing elements crucial towards successful problem solving like exact figures stated preliminary discussions around enhanced training methods undertaken recently alongside nutritious meal routines possibly playing part behind improving race pacing parameters across these participants especially focusing upon timings associated particularly revolved against said activities performed earlier preceding competition entries taking place presently under observation Currently unable however make predictions rooted purely grounding ourselves against available known data points Hence maintain vigilance whilst proceeding ahead looking forward seeing if perhaps eventually certain significant indicators turn surface allowing clearer comprehension progressively becoming attainable Thanks though regardless hopefully soon enough realistic forecasts concerning probable updates become feasible To keep abreast please consult pertinent resources stay tuned seeking possible forthcoming developments await us Relatively little precise info currently accessible thus impedes confident estimations Regarding proposed methodologies seemingly promising enhancement hopes remains yet subdued requiring tangential insights pending acquisition Until fortuitously receiving sufficient intel better decisions expected remain elusive Best Regards Your Devoted Assistant :) As described above consider the follow example scenario addressing calculation approach outlined previously:-Calculate George` s improvement through changing Diet:`Initial Second",
        " Gerald when it comes to timing their performance over 400 meter hurds races or events. When this situation changes due to change in diet regimen followed by Gerald, determine what happens next: His performances improve so significantly (upwards) as per specified improvement percentages such that these improvements make him closer but not yet completely equalling 'the other competitor'. To calculate exactly knowing all details mentioned may require additional specifications like exact increase rate; however if assuming gerald improves equally overall instead across different instances while maintaining initial differences steady until hitting max allowed capacity via said healthy regime i guess better results could certainly come about once those benchmark levels start being reached too making comparisons within similar frames even fairer again taking into account individual variance factors here also important since training quality & genes etc factor heavily among individuals affect outcomes both short term during workouts themselves long term potential capabilities.. Note regarding current scenario provided earlier stated differently stating lee getting slightly quicker indicating opposite trend happening meaning less gap forming vs increased pace observed previously hence needs rework accordingly without going full regression analysis type thing... Thus far though let us go based off basic premise initially presented before any progress/regression considerings included plus keeping things simple enough understandable easily despite complexities possibly involved later down line perhaps ;-) Given below calculations might help get clarity!

As such when you improve your performance by X% , assuming distance remains constant i(x=time),the percent change equals [(i(previous)-i(new))/i(previous)]*100 so rearranging leads us to solve for the old time through using [initial_total-(final)/X] or finally solving as follows[38/(1+(10/100))] or 1/(1+0.1)= approximately equal to  35 sec Therefore if gerald slowed down equally to lee\u2019s current pace but still achieved lower times due to nutritional improvements : His adjusted sprinting time under better fuelled conditions is closer to ~35 secs .
