Similarly, determine the quantity of clothes washed by David based off knowing that Sarah cleans four times what he washes. Fourfold value is obtained by multiplying the weight of David\u2019s load per piece of clothing by 4; therefore resulting into  400 / 4 equaling exactly 100 lbs cleaned. To find out the disparity in loads completed by Raynold compared to those executed by David one can subtract smaller figure representing David's workload (which amounts up to 100 pounds )from larger sum reflecting Rogerfield's productivity(200 pound). This simplifies down to just 200lb minus 100lbs equalling precisely 100pounds performed less frequently than others .

Thus when compared directly, one pound represents the numerical quantity per unit of comparison because we want the absolute difference not proportionality or ratio comparisons.

Since both Raymond and David take up just 1+4 portions respectivly according to our ratios above , their amounts become 1*133 -- approximately equalling 133 pounds (for Raymond), while David comes out being able to handle about twice less than him hence getting around only approx_approx~ 133 / 2 =~~ 66.66pounds worth of washing per round.(approximate values rounded down ) To compute differences like these simply use subtraction; thus it becomes :- {133 -(or} ~{133-(66)} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                      3 ~~~~~ Approximately Thus when someone asks you 'what is the average difference'.

Firstly, since S=(R/H)*D , meaning D= R*(1/2) and substituting into above relation so we get : 400=(r*h)/(r/2)= h /[(r/2)] or equivalently  400/(d/r). From here you just need plug back in numbers . Let\u2019s use algebra first before direct substitution because sometimes students may forget one part but see all others making them fall over quickly!

Therefore, the difference in laundry load between Raymond and David who respectively wash 200 pounds versus 100 pounds per week means 100 more loads cleaning work falls upon him when compared to David every time. Hence, it follows correctly without any ambiguity; 'the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.'

        " says Sarah does four times (or multiplies) what David does; hence Divide 400 by 4 which equals 100. That\u2019s the amount of laundry David does. Lastly subtract these quantities. Subtracting Raymond's quota of 200 pounds from David's makes it equal to 200 \u2013 100 or simply put, Raymond doesn\u2019t outweigh Dave so this results to zero differences. However you asked about raymond-david not dsraymandifferso Hence let\u2019s take away David\u2019s load from Ramdoodle Which comes up to D=Raymond Load+Dave Lload= 200+100=300 ",
        " difference in the amount of laundry Raymond (who we calculated earlier) and David (from our calculation). Subtracting the weight ratio amounts leads us finding their differences like this; Ray minus Dav=difference_in_amount=(Raymond\u2019s weight)-(David\u2019s weight)=200\u22121600=-1400 pounds indicating you get negative because Raymond was doing less than david not exactly opposite which means ray didn\u2019t just take away part off what davie put into but rather even smaller portion of those who took up far bigger space being davies piece overload compare! That makes logical sense right ?? Yes please continue explaining further.. I would really love your help!! Your Explanation continues...

Thus the solution could not change even though I tried increasingly complex sentence structure explanations because the actual calculation remained unchanged regardless of verbosity or brevity used within constraints specified earlier.\r\r"
