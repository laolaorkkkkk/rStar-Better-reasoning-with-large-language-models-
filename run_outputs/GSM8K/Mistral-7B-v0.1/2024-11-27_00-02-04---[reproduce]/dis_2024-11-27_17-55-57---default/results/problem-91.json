        " that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy (who we already know has four). This means Marcia has six pet dogs/cats because you need to add these extra ones when talking about people not numbers or letters(because this question uses words instead so if it said 'four plus one dog', etc.). Finally, find out what their combined amount totals up to; which would mean subtracting those original animals owned individually but adding them all together once found.(i.e., multiply everything into single units) Add your resultant value since multiplication doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to addition:(since marcia only owns six cats.) Since nothing else was mentioned regarding other types or breeds,(no word indicating anything special like \u2018and cat lovers,\u2019 et al.), our best assumption here can assume that every type counts equally among themselves without any further distinctions nor priorities placed toward specific kinds such birds versus fish\u2014simply put \u2014all creatures regardless species counted .
