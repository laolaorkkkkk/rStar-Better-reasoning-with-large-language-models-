        " miles, this would be 6/2=3 mph. To determine the overall required average speed over the entirety of the trail being completed within four hours ((the original walking rate)(time elapsed)+(required additional speed)(remaining duration)=desired travel distance), we can rearrange our equation above; desired average speed=(total route)/[initial portion walked]+(additional pace needed)*(duration yet uncompleted). Substituting specific values into variables provided, calculate as follows: [3+x]*[4-(Time taken so far)]=[Desired Travel Rate]/Total Route*[(Trail Length)-Distance Already Completed]. Solving yields [(4-2)](Average Mileage Over Extended Period)=[(Required Velocity )*(Remaining Miles Of Course)]; thus: 2y = x*6 => y=3mph.* Therefore, if marissa wishes to maintain their previously attained mean velocity throughout completing all sections of the trek while achieving exactly twice such initial figure--an aggregate throughput level equivalent or greater than both current trajectory achievement plus prospective requirements necessitating future efforts equal no lesser than tripled prior output rates\u2014a supplementary motion requirement equating precisely double former movement expenditures across comparable distances connotes only moderately reduced temporal consumption necessary henceforth until ultimate endpoint reached.[^1][^1] ",
        " if she walked the entire trail at this pace; divide the total distance (12 miles) by the current walking pace (3 mph): Total Walk Time = 12 / 3 = 4 hours.

Determine the distance still needed to hike. Subtract the initial covered mileage (first six miles) from the overall length (total twelve). This gives you the remaining leg\u2019s measure as follows: Miles Left To Hike = Total Length Of Trail\u2013 Mile Count Completed Before Breaks Or Slow Downs= 12 \u2013 6 = 6 miles. Finally calculate Marissa\u2019s required minimum speed over these last kilometers using our definition of \u201cspeed\u201d once again\u2014Speed equals Distance divided by Time taken(or worked out previously); so apply your findings here such as following: Required Minimum Slope = Necessary Velocity Over Last Kmiles Achievable From Breakneck Pace Only=(Necessary Kilometers Still Uncompleted)/Required Time To Complete Them=.

        " So, 6 / 2 equals 3 mph; this implies Marissa was walking roughly three miles every hour before taking a break or changing pace. Since the rest of the question tells us that Marissa\u2019s desired overall rate isn't faster than just maintaining her current one \u2013 but equal to exactly doubled up over four whole trips i.e., 2*(x+y)/(z), let's assume z here as 'total_time'. Considering only part of journey already made totalling around halfway along which constitutes y minutes spent hence adding all times together makes our equation come out like following=> [Total Distance/Overall Speed] = Total Time => [12miles/(Double Desired Rate)]= Z Hours. Substitute known values into these equations since Overall Speed denotes desirable target not being quicker thereby making its use redundant when compared against previously calculated Avg Speeds due to constant conditions throughout initial stages yet aiming towards increasing same through future action thus excluding any unnecessary calculations involving multiplication factors such doubles etc..
