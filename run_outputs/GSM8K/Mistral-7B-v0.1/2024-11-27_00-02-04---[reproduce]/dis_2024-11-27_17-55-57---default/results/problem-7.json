This event occurs right before completion therefore if we divide into third sections meaning one section out of three (which represent portions completed )   We know already firstly whole process cannot last above 100 mins because even though computer was able to run fast enough as compared to its average capability or workload(it works faster than usual) however due to system performance requirements while running background tasks like updating files etc.,the overall efficiency drops significantly especially within large scale operations such as data transfers thus impeding progress towards achieving desired results unless taken proper action .. Thus considering those facts coupled with mentioned restrictions ; let ' s assume based upon available information about situation provided hereafter..there exist multiple components involved throughout these factors namely power consumption rates associated hardware peripherals used during operation alongwith corresponding impact levels generated across them all resultinginto slowdown effect observed once reaching approximately midway pointthroughout entiretydownloadprocessthathavetakenplaceoftheywhenoverwhenthencomputersystemshavesubsequentlyforcedunexpectedrestartseventhatincurreddelayeffectontoachainoftasksexecutedsequentiallyaspartsofoperationthatarebeingcarriedoutconsecutivelytowardsgoalfulldownloadingtototalfilesamountwanthereindefinedabove...Inturnresultinglyimpactincostrelatedtimelapseefficiencyinefficientdatatransferprocessesperformedontheseverydevicessocondisimilarcostassociateddelaysmightexhibitedatnaturalfreepauseintervalsaftercertainpointwhereupontimebeforecompleteprocessingcannochandexceedtargetperiodictargetdueconstraintsinvolvedwithoutadditionalexpansionofresourcesneededtoaccomplishtaskcompletionsuccessfullyuntillastsectionremainsattheendstageawaitingtillfinishinguploadintotheirequidedserverhostenablingallcorrespondingresponsesiogethersignificantlydecreasedspeedandbandwidthcapabilityratherthanoriginalestimatestheaveragedoneundernormaloperationalenvironmentalparametersbythoseprovidinghighdemandserviceorstoragefacilitiesregardingtransactionprotocolsupportrequirementsfoundatsystemcomponentssuchawithnetworkhardwareroomsusedfortranscendinginformationexchangeviaremoteconnectivitymethodsavailablebetweendistinctclientapplicationser",
        " Since this occurs when approximately halfway into the download process, about 40% of the original data was downloaded before interrupted i.e., 40% X 100 minutes equal(approximately)= 40 minuite hence taking place around mid-point thus making windows restarts necessary . From calculation above , normally we expect these files to complete their upload within 1 hr. And since carla didn\u2019t resume because of window forcefully closed due updating issues ..we need to repeat those initial calculations again..again considering downlodling up until point just prior stopping...carla completed nearly 40 percent during first attempt so next assumption goes as follows::calculating what % progress made till last successful completion therefore assuming average rate continued \u2026let say approx. similar conditions repeated itself throughout the remaining duration\u2026the equation looks like ::remaining_time=file remainder amount/(average speeds reached while still connected). To figure out remainig times needed using approximation values derived below :total dowload remained ~->which means upto previous failed connection~**=(total length-(first part*percent filled))-->wherein percentage*(original timing)*(ration)->gives us estimation result based upon previalous successive rates..Total Time Left estimated:= ** ((File Size)(First Part Percent Filled)/Rate) Therefore if you multiply (approx.)for eg.: ***(200GB \u00d7 (.4f)), overwhelmingly yield roughly:(about 8 hours ).Hence your estimate might look something closer along towards double than expected.(more less )-->(as our estimates used arbitrary numbers wuthour simplifications)..However note here even though approximations employed tend ta increase uncertainty margin further ;still useful guidelines could bfrth gained regarding possible extent toward nearer correct value..so let s keep things simpler keeping most parameters fixed yet acknowledging presence off random variable affectiand resulting uncertainties surrounding actual precise timings involved..also worth mentionitng abouddifferences among operating systems having varying impacton performance profiles comparedto general cases typically involving large datasets especially ones under highdemands suchlikebulk transfersbetween serversover wide area networks.;this leadsintovariablilityabroaderrangeofscenarioswothinvolving different factorsincluding network trafficdensitylevelsinterfacestechnologyqualitycomparisonamongdifferenthardwareconfigurationsetc;allpossibly influencingfinaltimere"
