Since these values equal parts making up one whole product\u2014a single robe here \u2014their quantities can simply be combined directly together as follows; 2(blue)+1(white)=total=3 bolts . Therefore according to our analysis based upon instructions , three individual materials or units compose the complete makeup of our target object i.e., the entirety of what makes a 'robe'. Consequently, therefore ; the quantity requested within such context would read : ",

Also remembering our previous discussion about reactions approaching equilibrium; when such cases arise these expressions provide identical results but may require different handling!
