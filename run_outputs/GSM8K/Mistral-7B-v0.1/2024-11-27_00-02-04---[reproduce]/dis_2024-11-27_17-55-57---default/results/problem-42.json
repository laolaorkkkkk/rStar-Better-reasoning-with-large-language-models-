When counting these individual elements which make up groups (pies), it wouldn\u2019t matter if those individuals belong together or not \u2013 hence grandma made only parts here i.e., slices but counted everything separately so let us count whole units too therefore total would again result in 40*total types=all totaled since none was mentioned about any other kind than apples . Hence , Grandma initially put exactly  40 single portions(units) ie fourteen servings available post meal consumption means Guests took precisely (grand ma initial offering )\u2212 consumptions leftover : => **Total served**=(Initial serving)=\u21d2((Serving before)-leftovers)/types=> (**Difference/Types used**)*number->>(consumption)->>= Different ways can get same numbers like above equation..so based off this explanation its evident enough mathematically still even though conceptualizing seems confusing sometimes try going back few steps & breaking down problem statement itself really well! We know every guest who wants slice gets another chance when filling bowl until piece runs dry till last person finishes him having lesser portion sizes also maybe sharing among several platter might affect things greatly whereas everyone grabbing full sized ones equally distributes share fairly easily irrespective knowing size difference amongst others etc .. Anyhow despite small differences resulting due different possible arrangements could lead arrivant results varying slightly albeit close approximations otherwise calculated right !! Well basically understanding theory behind equations works wonders helping solve complex problems involving multi variables involved systems while applying formulas applied correctly yields accurate answers quickly simplifying process making calculations manageable efficiently \u2026 But most importantly remember always pay attention details carefully reading instructions properly ensures proper application leading towards desired outcome whether dealing simple arithmetical operations requiring basic knowledge skills essential building solid foundation learning mathematics along way further ahead through practicing consistently refining technique progress overtime maintain sharp focus dedication commitment mastery eventually becoming proficient expert tackling various challenging tasks successfully navigating worldwide interconnected global village society\u2026 !!!!!!!!
