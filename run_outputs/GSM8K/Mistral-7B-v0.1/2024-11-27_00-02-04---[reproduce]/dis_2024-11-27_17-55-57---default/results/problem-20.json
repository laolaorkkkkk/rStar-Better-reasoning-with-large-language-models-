As such .6*15=9 litres containing all but one fifth (.4*15)=6 litres purer liquid plus remainder part thus equaling approx seven point fourteen litre per say [(or possibly almost] seven point forty]. Thus adding these together produces seventeen point twentyfour litres of diluted mix whose quantity would likewise round off close to this figure; if not quite identical however since both sums cannot precisely combine owing their dissimilar levels within respective liquids... This calculation implies nearly 17 percentage over eleven whole ones thereby creating another small variation based upon exact numbers involved namely : firstly , having less available space than planned due either excess flow through pipes causing pressure drop etc . Or secondarily because no matter whatever method employed using said tools may still yield different results depending mainly upon variables present inside system itself therefore resulting slight difference observed compared previous calculations accordingly ..
