Sixth set was zero indicating no purchase hence summing these yields twelve plus zero amount making only twelve transactions worth consideration.

But according to your original question requesting us strictly about 'how many films', only considering their existence rather than sale price etc., was meant; therefore our solution stands correct under this specific interpretation without needing calculations related to potential losses/profit margins as per regular business metrics considerations.
