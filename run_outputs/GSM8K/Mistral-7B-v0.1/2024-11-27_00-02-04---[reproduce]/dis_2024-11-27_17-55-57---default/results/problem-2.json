However, as part of answering our question which asks about making Profit out of selling this same home afterwards, it becomes relevant here that 'Profit\u2019 indicates financial gain obtained when revenue (money earned) exceeds costs or loss. Therefore if you want to calculate realistic earning/profit figure one might consider original purchase price plus any investments made like repairing/maintenance work etc., also called Total Cost before applying appreciation percentage yield due to improvements over time. We first compute initial total_cost ($80k purchasing+$50k renovations)=$130K; next apply calculated upsurge rate i.e multiplied by factor representing surge resulting change+(i). Here ((original+$repair)*upsurge rate)+factor(+)($inc$) yields output=new overall market valuation post enhancements=$260K . Finally subtract what actually ended up paid off altogether-$total_price invested=$130K leading us directly downwards towards actual monetary benefit derived thus bringing everything full circle.(reiterative nature & systemic progression highlight impact efficiency)-subtract current sale proceedings $-new equity produced (-)$gain=-(-)(+$(output))$.

Therefore Jonh made a loss as this equaled out to about negative one hundred seventy thousand , which means he invested around seventeen point seven million dollars into property but earned only eighty kgs back since nothing came off sale or re rental..

However since Josh invested both into purchasing property, I assume you mean investing also amount including repair costs which amounts up as stated earlier i.e $130,000 ($80,000+$50,000), hence net outcome would actually reflect positively rather than negatively like above calculation shows thus finally answering your question assuming same conditions but considering all expenses put together as capital input yield : Profit=  Selling Price Post Renovation less Capital Invested; Therefore , if Cost of House initially was 'C_h', Repair fee '$C_r'$ & overall % increase via sale '%i%$(in decimal form) formula used here depict relationship among them therefore ; Sales=(C_H+(((C_H+ C_R)*(1+(%i/100)))) )Profit= Final sales figure -(costofhouse+\" \"+CostoftheRepairs); Since values provided mention initial cost \"$c_H\"=\"$c_R\"; furthermore \"%i/\"= \"*(\"Initial&\"+Additional)&profit%\" / Decimal Equivalent Of Percentage Given.. .Now plugging Values:$P=$80,000*[1]+($50,000)+[$80,000*(1.5)]-$[80,000+$50,000]$-([{$x}].%)*$[(.$y$.+.$z$.]]=-[-$30,000/$(-0.5)$]* [.-50K.]---So ultimately its clear,$p=15k-->\"He made a profit of $15,000.\"",

Thus, instead of having gained any profits through this venture into home improvement gambling, Josh ended up suffering a loss equaling half their initial investment amount because when sold \u2014as per current real estate conditions\u2014 it could only bring back slightly above original purchase prices as property values remained generally unchanged during such transactions while both parties simultaneously committed high sums towards potential enhancements.. Therefore \u2013 regardless if one regards quick turnarounds within capitalist economies beneficially or not\u2013 , pursuing activities entailing considerable risk factors ought always precede clear understanding vis-\u00e0-vis long term benefits potentially available .

To calculate actual profits use this formula ((New Value / Total Cost)*100)-100 i.e., since our focus here was gain & gains therefore we need adjustments hence take following steps -> add back purchase price [=new base], New Property Worth/Base Price*($23+5)/(Original Base)+$80k=[final figure] , divide result over Initial Outlay=$130k,$ subtract Result Over First Amount Multiplied By One Hundred.$divideByOneHundrethenMinusDozenThousandThatEquals",
