Hence it would equate to about (1250 / 300) approximately equaling around ~4.17 calories/gram (the remaining content).

This needs recalculation due to different basis as here base being units instead of overall pack weight so dividing the wanted additional calorie count by respective 'CaloriesPerGram': Extra permitted candy portions -> 200 divided by [~4.17] results into roughly nearly close to ~48 grams approx.
