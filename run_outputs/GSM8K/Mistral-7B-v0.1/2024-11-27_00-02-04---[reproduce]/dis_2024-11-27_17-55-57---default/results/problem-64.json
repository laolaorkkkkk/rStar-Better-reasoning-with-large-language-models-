        " Therefore when Sophia fills her full (in this case empty) tank using these 4 additional gallons, or every other refill, she could travel approximately eight times the distance pertaining only to those four liters used during the recharge process\u2014or roughly twelve kilometers; as stated earlier this corresponds directly to one liter having allowed another sixteen hundred meters possible coverage over said interval (calculation based upon initial mileage achieved without requiring any new fuel input).

To determine when you need refill check if travel length exceeds available storage space divided into calculated rate; compare(\"Travel Distance <= Available Range\"); This statement results true so thus no further action necessary while journey continues but once distanced surpasses amount stored consider replenishment prior stopping..

Note this includes both the initial travel before refilling plus what additional range was calculated using known averages (and assuming these remain constant). Hence , if we only want to calculate based upon previously gathered data during fueling activity (excluding prior unaccounted miles), simply use the remaining value which represents sole new potential distances achievable post replenishment : i.e.,  25(miles) /gallon multiplied against original petrol volume ;i.e.,; ->  25*(12)=<<25*12=300>>300 milestones possible .
