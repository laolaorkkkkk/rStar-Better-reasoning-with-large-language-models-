Subtract these distances to find out what remained; subtract either one away from both sides if needed to get their difference or calculate directly without rearranging terms since it only involves subtraction. That means the ride length minus your summed individual lengths equals twice its middle point value.\r",
        " completing another full journey which means (the whole tour/number_of_full_tours)x=remaining; here remaining length=(whole list)*(a part)/1-(noun)-total.\r\rDetermine remaining trips or fractional parts less than one using the remainder operation modulo function like this example python code:print(\"His fractions add up to %d\"%((num+denominator))). First determine the denominator since it stays constant throughout calculation as follows:- Take into account all possible distances within both rides. Here we consider every point over our range [start mileage] through & including ending[stopMileage]. Therefore set maximum start position value=[distanceStartPoint], minimum start postion value=[min(finalStops)+distanceBetweenFinalStopPoints]). Set stopping points values:[listDistanceOfAllPossibleFinishingStoppingPoints],[maximum starting position]/[(max([startPosition]+[-range])),range]].. Calculate the remainders following these steps if you use integers.- Find numerators correspondingly equal to their respective finishing locations [-len(positionsToConsiderForThisRange)] :[[index][positionAtTheseIndexesInListTotalDashLength]for index,locationAcutallequivalentlyinThisOtherWidhtRangethatis [(i*rangesize)+lastpartitionstartpointval]), locationToconsiderforthiswidth].[calculatedRemainder](=>howmanytomustbeaddedwiththishalfsize)). Secondly calculate denominators equally dividing entire routes width while taking care not exceed initial partition ranges but also covering any additional partial size required due to surplus residual amounts.<|end_of_instructions|> To find out how far Henry actually biked between his first and second stops without considering just when exactly those stops occurred, follow these logical deductions based solely upon the information provided about the overall route lengths.",
        " distance covered without stopping. That sum equals 35 miles (Because it would read as if you went past both halts but continued till destination which isn\u2019t possible). To know the actual coverage until the second halt we subtract this value found above(i.e., Difference)from full journey i.e.(Total Distance/Distance Covered With Halt=Difference), or simply Half Journey less difference due to hilp. Calculate half of whole mileage; Here Total Mileage /Number Of Halts=Miles Per Stop. Substitute appropriate values into equation like so : 60miles/2Halts+[2*(Coverup up To End \u2013 First_stop)] . Thus our formula becomes  30Miles per Stop plus twice [end minus start]. Evaluate coveruptoEnd (60\u201315)=45 Miles evaluate Startpoint+(SecondStop\u2212StartPoint); Our original question sought out 'betweenFirstAndSecoundStops'.
