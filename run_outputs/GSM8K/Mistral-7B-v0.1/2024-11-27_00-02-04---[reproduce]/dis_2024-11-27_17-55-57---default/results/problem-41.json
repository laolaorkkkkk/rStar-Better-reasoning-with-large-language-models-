        " gemstone (which we already know): 400 feet. When she holds it inside this range, such as say exactly midway through its flight trajectory; thus half way into or close enough to cause damage would surely come off worse while also missing further out due to arc physics & friction force acting along travel path lengthening projectile movement time etc resulting increased error margin against accuracy required here so if one throws twice instead let\u00e2\u0080\u0099say thrice using same speed technique but faster launch angle increasing average speeds thereby reducing air/water resistance caused errors even smaller though harder catcher compensate because timing needs perfect sync otherwise you miss again anyway right \u00e2\u0080\u00a6and yet another increase occurs causing slower returns hence hitting spot target location below actual point reached despite aiming accurately!
