        " 11 = 44 rows because we calculate up until but not including when Gene turned 34 as stated 'He **is** currently 34'. Since it states 'Each row is made of blocks...', this means he used all those holidays/vacations before turning 34 making only these full rows hence why no partial calculations or roundings occur here which would complicate things unnecessarily. And if you add them together meaning; Number_of Row+ Number Block per row= Total Quilt_block . We get : 44 Rows* One(quilting)-Block Per Year= 44 Quilt_block ; so GENE HAS FORTY FOUR QUILT BLOCKS IN TOTAL SO THE ANSWER IS THIRTY FOUR. Thanks!
