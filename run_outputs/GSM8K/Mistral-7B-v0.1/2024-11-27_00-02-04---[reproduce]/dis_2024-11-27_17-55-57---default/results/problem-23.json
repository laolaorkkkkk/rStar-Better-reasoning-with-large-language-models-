However assuming you mean height reduced overall due to melting(which I interpret as subtracting thus negative), hence Your actual new size remains smaller than initial one(-10 cm less than original dimension ), because when objects shrink their relative position compared with starting point gets lower i.e., becomes closer not further away ,so considering magnitude only without regard for positive vs negative signs which represent opposite directions respectively here ;yours still physically located within range bounded region denoted through absolute values !
