Since logs apply only when numbers or variables inside log functions aren\u2019t equal zeroes either one because natural logarithm doesn;t exist except non-zero value otherwise undefined therefore if any variable present within said function goes negative making things invalid leading towards division operation resulting further into complex expressions due having multiplied out exponentials containing radical components potentially complicating matters quite severely sometimes even mathematically impossible scenarios could arise thus causing difficulties while trying handle such situations hence avoiding problems dealing wth fractional exponents involving irrational roots etc besides being somewhat unnecessary anyway considering easier alternative approaches utilized instead usually preferred whenever possible ones including trigonometric functions applied specifically sine cosines tangents arctangent secant cosecants cotangents reciprocal powers fractions algebraic manipulations logical reasoning geometric properties integral calculus derivatives limits series convergence divergence sequences sets relations equivalence comparisons counting principles combinations permutations graphs networks flow charts tree diagrams mind maps brainstorm ideas hypotheses theories proofs examples cases counterexamples anomalies contradictions inconsistencies errors mistakes oversights misunderstandings misconceptions prejudices biases assumptions beliefs opinions feelings emotions attitudes postures body language gestures facial expressions speech patterns dialect accents slangs lexicons idiolect phonemes morphemes syntax semantic pragmatics discourse dialogic communication processes interactions relatability social dynamics human behavior psychology cognition neurological activity brain waves neural synapsis connectomics quantum mechanics relativity astrophysics cosmology particle physics thermodynamics statistical mechanics fluid dynamics aerodynamics hydrodynamics elasticity materials science mechanical engineering electronics electrical circuits programming languages software development",

Here X denotes excess quantities beyond what was considered collectively before separations became necessary hence why multiplication takes place whereas without inclusion no additional measures ought exist other than direct addition! Therefore subtracting makes sure none overlap occurs which could result incorrectness while multiplying simply adds onto results due overlapping cases arising during operations involving sums consisting partly separate entity values unlike combining groups within themselves alone etc..
