Thus, Marie orders four boxes of pizza which costs altogether as requested ($8.5*4$)= $34 $. It was worth it because their prices matched my calculation precisely.

Let\u2019s reconsider our calculations. Correcting my previous mistake, let us subtract all known expenses except those involving boxes of pizza to determine their value separately since the correct pricing didn't fall within what Mary expectedly allocated($50). Thus; initial investment without considering pizzas sums up 12+15+6=$33 . From this amount being deducted off against the overall spending results into remaining outlay i.e., Total spend \u2013 Non Pizza Spend : Subtraction operation yields ,$50-$33=$17 $.

Add them all up first ($12 +$15+$6=$33) You need find out what was spent on pizzas since you know exactly everything else! And subtract this sum from your original equation($50-$33= $17). Each price tag means just one item so divide:$17/$8.5 per pizza can get us our solution(if no remainder than product belongs directly)! We see we could buy three sets or simply solve the division problem as well!! Therefore, 'each case yields identical results': either dividing makes sense here because its like saying I spend those X amount overtime;or multiplying gets simpler too which equates right side only:(it seems obvious but still works.)
