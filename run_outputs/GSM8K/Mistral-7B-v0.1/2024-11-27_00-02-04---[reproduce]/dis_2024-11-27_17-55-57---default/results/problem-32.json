I changed feet/hour to minutes which obviously isn\u2019t helpful because everybody knows nobody walks anywhere measuring distances any longer than what my little kids get up to around here (*if*) they aren\u2019t running too fast away while being distracted about something else ;)). Anyway next instead converted these dimensions back out again as percentages relative to a full hour (the least busy part of someone not wanting them tied outside waiting for another human coming home), hence why such seemingly absurd numbers show above.(Furthermore when computing % increase versus reduction against baseline data sets etc., calculating based upon fractional changes rather than absolute differences usually proves to work better :)))We don\u2019t really deal like scientists who obsess over milligram measurements quite often unless working towards precise pharmacological studies \u2013\u2013 yet anyone walking needs nothing short lesser!)
