Last but not least, we know based off this information alone that our mystery mathematician who makes up all these answers states that because any percentage can only represent something being increased or decreased when compared against another value; therefore if you state 'percentage less' without specifying which reference base point would mean either doing multiplication(if increasing percentages), division(decreasing ones since those come closer together as values grow larger). According them using words instead saying just numbers gets complicated especially considering different bases could lead completely opposite results due rounding issues making things really hard sometimes unless your working strictly relative vs absolute situations like here!

        " What was Gunter\u2019s estimate if it turned out that these estimates agreed with what was actually in the jar (assuming this happens only once)?",
        " so (80/2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60. The third friend says 25% more than the first one, so 80*0.25 = 20; this means another friend predicts 80 + 20 = 100. To find out what the average prediction was we need to sum up all these numbers which equals 80+60+100=240 and divide them by three(the amount of people). Thus 240/3=<<240/3=80>>80 . ",
        " other friends as well but we need only three numbers because when you calculate them together divided it makes up your question. We also know about another person saying if this was lessened (which means subtract) by something what would happen or increase amount..the others who made predictions said different things like halved(half), plus quarter etc\u2026but all those details don\u2019t change our result even though interesting!. As no value changes these conditions nor tells us anything else regarding any adjustments needed while comparing against reality; therefore simply add both values mentioned here directly : so altogether mean calculating summing sums/mean equals adding oneself twice before averaging outcomes\u2013if necessary apply formulas such rules accordingly depending situation requirements available resources involved throughout life span till present moment including current age years).

        " friend said 60 (which was calculated as 20 more than half the initial estimate), and we can figure out what the other guesses would likely look like based off these numbers since all three answers aren\u2019t whole numbers except 60... We may assume this lastest guy wants roughly similar values because if not it might sound odd but without context i could also imagine another reason behind why someone wouldn\u2019t want to use round numbers or something else.. But anyway let me add them up again according to those assumptions so far : First Guess(A)\u2009=\u200980 Second Guess(B\u200a)=\u200a60 Third Guess C Unknown .. And remember our goal here Was To Find THEIR **average** _so_ Once You Have All Three Amount Of Estimations (**First Two Already Known_) __You__ Can Add Them Up Divide By Total Count & Boom !! Your "
