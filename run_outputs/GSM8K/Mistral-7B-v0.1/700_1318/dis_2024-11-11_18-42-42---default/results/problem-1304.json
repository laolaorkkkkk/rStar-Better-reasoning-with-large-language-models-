To start first compute one quarter\u2019s worth of normals enrollemnt which would equal four thousand divided by our fractional value here(fourth).

We also know that Butler High School, which houses roughly three quarters (or .75) lesser amount of students when compared to norm highschool(Reduced Amount of Students At BHS), can thus be calculated using this equation; ReducedAmountOfStudentsBHS= InitialNumberofStudents*(.75); Solving we get ~3000 reduced count. Therefore if you want to compare these numbers one way would simply subtract them resulting in what difference was recorded throughout their studies ; DifferenceInStudentCount=(IntialNoofstudents)-(Reducestudentcount)=DifferencetotalstudentenrolledSo the student counts differ quite remarkably during semester timespans hence understanding such disparities leads towards better learning management techniques & overall growth rates..
