It means that if you divide into four parts \u2013 like cutting slices of cake \u2014 three would represent yesterday\u2019s writing results [because it was less]. One remaining piece represents one quarter or current production. Each slice equals as such: n+n/3=9 so \u2026the formula becomes :(3n)/3+(n)/3=9 . which further simplifies down to (4*n)/3=(9)*3 --> multiplying out those fractions , makes us get our equation equaling ->  4n=27..then solve it .. dividing both sides through divisor \u201c4\u201d; ...it leaves you with \u201d\u2026\u201c n=6.7~ therefore ; ~she wrote about six books /novels per calendar year since before i am even here ;) sorry math lovers ! But just remember...if not using common denominators during addition operation inside fractional expression.... always find them first OR reduce your expressions fully BEFORE adding whatever else together along side whole numbers too !! Alrighty all thats said & done lets round up any decimals found previously because nothing ever comes close enough exactly unless told NOT TO .... hence ending off w/: N=7 Novel Writings Done During Previous Year :) Cheers mrwx :) Have fun playing around over Mathmatical stuff my friend hahaha!

        " (three fourths) of all books she\u2019s ever completed writing this year. Therefore if 9 represents three fourths or equivalently .75 , you divide it up into its individual parts; multiply by four so as not to confuse yourself because fractions make things complicated sometimes but also easy when using simple methods like dividing whole numbers apart before combining them again later down line hence thus why division always happens first followed closely behind multiplication whenever working out problems involving fractional percentages such those dealing directly concerning quantities made available during specific seasons whilst taking measurements taken over several different years within various environments across global regions including cities both large & small while simultaneously factoring environmental changes due mostly through natural occurrences happening everywhere throughout earth s atmosphere especially surrounding our own home turf backyard right here near us personally speaking making everything worthwhile understanding math basics completely since life depends upon critical decisions based solely off solid reasoning derived straight form scientific facts ground work built around empirical research conducted time past generations gone prior centuries ago however ultimately leading only towards truth regardless whatever course whether good bad evil lies ahead destined toward unknown future beyond human imagination possibly unimaginable entirely depending mainly wholly related specifically pertaining present circumstance surroundings currently affecting lives presently being lived worldwide nevertheless influencing behaviours directed away far farther reaching consequences caused indirectly immediately following soon afterwards still persisting steadfast longer term permanence becoming evident finally eventually settling slowly gradually fading gently softening subtle disappearing altogether silently almost magically quietly slipping effortlessly seamlessly smoothing transition without even trying hard nor seemingly attempting purposefully mindful actively concentrated attentive focus centered intently listening cautiously observing calm waiting patient moments peacefully standing firm ready willing able equipped optimistically confident courageously determined passionately driven deeply motivated absolutely energized full vibrant powerful enthusiastically inspired inspiring others alike equally everyone else too proud humble glad happy satisfied content thoroughly pleased comfortably comfortable secure feeling safe sound well informed aware educated knowledgeable experienced skilled capable proficient expert performing excellent job consistently delivering quality results high standards exceed expectations daily accomplish great feat successfully completing projects challenges overcome hurdles jumped difficulties solved puzzled answers providing satisfying satisfactory explanations clarified mysteries understood resolved conflicts settled debated disputes negotiated treaties concluded agreements signed documents approved contracts authorized licenses issued permits granted certifications earned awards honors received accol",
        " This was three quarters (or 3/4) of what she wrote this year. To find out four fourth would mean we need multiply those ten words I apologize; it seems like my previous message was cut off unintentionally. Here\u2019s another attempt without interruption:",
        " It means Regina wrote (9/3)\u00d7(4/4)= 3x4=<<9/3*4/4*3*4=(12)>>12 books throughout this year. ",
        " out of N books which equals three times four (three quarter). Equation would look like this: n/N=3*quarter so: 9/(n)=3*(1/4) -> divide both sides by numbers than remains:  9 >-->   3/4x(quadrant)>--->        QUOTE : X>>quotient>>QUOTADELIMITERXQuotient is basically result divided whole thing.\rSo what I need here was just basic division \r",
        " amount she writes this year. Let n represent how many was just write out as our unknown (n), so it would look like 9/(x)=3/4 . To find 'x', cross multiply getting  9*4=3*(x) Simplifying yields   36=(3)(x). Divide both sides by three gets you --> 12 = x. Regina currently has not written any books yet -- but if I understood your problem correctly.\r\rIt appears my previous explanation assumed that all novel counts happened within one single period or timeframe instead of across multiple years per se; considering what\u2019s stated about writing over various periods such seasons \u2013 months perhaps even weeks depending upon context clarification may indeed affect conclusive outputs hence requiring revisions hereunder accordingly once further guidance provided whilst keeping assumptions aside until validity certified respectively.:\rWhat numbers seem logical based upon information previously presented thus far suggesting continuous daily tasks occurring throughout distinct temporal segments rather than instantaneous completion entirety encompasses potentially greater scope inclusively concerning multilateral factors contributing towards cumulative aggregations thereby yielding diverse quantifiable results relative differing circumstances otherwise considered under same categorized terms albeit temporality might warrant additional contemplation specifically relating accuracy expectancy levels among others correlatively relevantly influencing numerical values derived directly arising stemming principals applied equally systematicatically adherence protocolic principles strictly conformant normative standards set forth precisely detailingly meticulously designed structures intrinsically linked harmoniously integrated interrelated components holistically functioning integrally operating optimally collectively maximizing operational efficiencies effectiveness proficiency productivity simultaneously fostering cooperative synergistic teamwork promoting shared goals objectives aspirations endeavors achievements accomplishments success attainment performance quality excellency superior output exceedances surpassings benchmarks records statistical statistics reports analysis data visualization metrics interpretability assessable reliability trustworthiness credibility integrity honesty transparency accountability responsible decision making ethical choices moral judgement wisdom experience knowledge understanding learning insights discoveries innovations breakthrough technologies inventions patented intellectual properties trademark registrations copyright royalties licenses agreements contractual obligations duties responsibilities roles functions positions titles hierarchy organizational structure personnel management workforce human resources leadership motivation inspiration visionary direction passion creativity imagination ideas concepts theories hypotheses hypothesis research studies experiments inquiry investigation testing validation verification empirical evidence"
