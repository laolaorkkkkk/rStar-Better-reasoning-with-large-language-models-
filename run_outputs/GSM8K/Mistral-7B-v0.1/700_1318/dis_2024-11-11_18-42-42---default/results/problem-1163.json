        " three events per day. Each event requires using one mask twice because Tyrion uses it once when entering and another as he exits. That means during a single day, he would need 3 (events) x 2 (mask usages/event) = 6 masks. Since we want to calculate this over a period of 2 days, multiply daily usage by 2:  6 (daily masks used) x 2 (days) = 12. Thus, in 2 days, Tyron uses 12 masks. The answer is: 12. ",

Eachtime when Tyrion wants to go outside, if faceshifts twice so it means he needs six extra ones because half of those occasions he only uses one instead of having worn two beforehand (the first occasion). Therefore he gets needlessly doubled up on these instances since wearing them both ways doesn\u2019t change whether or not someone sees him but still counts as \u201cusing\u201d them just once rather than using two separately like previously mentioned above thus ending this calculation short overall leading me astray initially thinking otherwise!
