And since Saskay can lift a mountain twice as high as Pippo can, so pippo would only able lift up about (1/(10*4))*(1/2) ==(1/4). Finally if pompiedo was said capable of lifting just over 1\" tall boulder onto its head but we assume it means less than .5 meters , converting this measurement into our current system; namely cm, i get ~5cm instead! Thus using these ratios along side knowledge gathered throughout history regarding similar objects being lifted when comparing sizes across different species helps us determine all possible dimensions required here..

To find difference wtween this value & naruto\u2019s capability multiply current capacity which was estimated earlier ie; ((Kagiyami^1)(Naruto ^ Ten))=((four)^one)*ten=(fortie)metres.( Forties divided through hundred)= four parts (. Four parts(.
