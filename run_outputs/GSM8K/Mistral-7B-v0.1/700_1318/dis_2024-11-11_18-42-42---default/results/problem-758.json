To calculate 5%, divide 5 by 100 (to convert percentage into fraction) which results in 0.05. Multiply 0.05 times 140 equals 7. That means, a product worth $140 receives a deduction of $7 as per a 5% markdown; hence leaving us effectively spending only $140 minus $. Discussing such financial concepts involves comprehension skills rather than following instructions or asking clarifying questions\u2014two key cognitive competencies linked to executive function deficits found commonly among adolescents diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These challenges often require tailored learning strategies aiming to simplify complex tasks involving numerical computations and critical thinking required during academic settings especially math classes dealing extensively with numbers like those seen here.\" Based on our dialogue so far about ADHD struggles related to mathematics education particularly when performing arithmetic operations using integers including addition/subtraction etc., can I infer your understanding regarding why students struggle might intensify while tackling increasing complexity within these subjects matter",

And therefore finally subtracting resulting cost ($7) from original markup results :$140-$7 = $133 . Thus, following calculation shows us that if one purchases item worth USD 140(with mark up), while being applicable upon him a promotional rebate equivalent to '5%' or 'one quarter'(that amounts to \"$\"7 only);the net expense eventually ends as exactly '$'133'.
