We also know eight additional plants need one full cup which when multiplied totals <<8*1=8>>8 cups. Finally count up all other remaining plants who only need about a fourth or .25 of a cup of water per unit if you subtract forty-four out of twenty i get sixteen. Those individual units combine would equal .25(per unit)*sixteen(units), therefore yielding another<<.25*16=.4>>cups altogether used herein. Adding them together brings our grand sum necessary for daily hydration amounts to just over tenish cubes indeed confirming via computational means it actually equivocates precisely eleven whole ones thus concluding...

These eight plants only require one fourth of a cup of water per plant according to question parameters; this equals .25x8=2cups altogether.. Thus we can solve using the following equation: ((4*.5)+(8*1)+(8*.25)=+1).

        " up all these values together (the sum represents the daily water requirement). Half a cup times four equals 2 cups; one cup time eight equals 8 cups, and a fourth of a cup multiplied by eight yields two quarters or 0.5 cups when expressed as decimal form. Combining them provides us 2+8+0.5 which totals ten plus zero point five adding equal seventeen points overall. Thus we determine seventeen pounds sixteenths represent our solution correctly answering this mathematical query presented initially.
