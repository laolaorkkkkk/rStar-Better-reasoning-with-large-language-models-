Consider these aspects while creating your summation: (A).

With such profits ($50-$22= ) we can expect him to acquire great cash flow when venturing into this business opportunity considering market demands & competition while keeping overhead expenses steady across production lines.(In other words , if demand remains high enough compared to supply price points ). Moreover understanding local farmers who could potentially supplement these prices would prove helpful since doing so means fewer transportation fees than buying them externally anyway.. As part f revenue growth goals consider negotiating long term contract terms woth domestic growers reducing dependency upon external sources thereby cutting back distribution chain disruptions due fluctuations within raw material supplies affecting bottom line results .. Finally remember : always prioritize customer needs above all else !!!

Since Tim produces twenty four such packages in twelve hours worth work(and sold as thirty six jars)(since three goes into twelve time four times); thus we know if he made no expenses but rather produced sixty eighty dollar gifts only within this period alone($50*36=1800$), than any fifty percent would take off making us reach . This means forty dollars net gain because out of said hundred amount taken away due to lack profitable yield.(A percentage calculation can further illustrate things better here however my calculator broke down so I apologize )This entire problem could simply breakdown like saying you wanted nothing else except fruits while still maintaining a nice cash flow during your life span hence why not sell them individually without worry about shipping etc.,..but alas its proven impossible once our numbers become larger!
