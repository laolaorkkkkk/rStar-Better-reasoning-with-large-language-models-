        " has only one quarter as many as Sean since Sean was described as having doubled this amount. Therefore we calculate .(56 / 2) * .25 , which evaluates to approximately thirty three or rounded up because you cannot own part of a marble 34 points. When we add these amounts together we get  80+34= 114 so altogether Carl and Cal possess collectively about seventy eight million units when their quantities merge into one whole group This calculation concludes our mathematical progression regarding the relationship among all involved subjects throughout every phase!
