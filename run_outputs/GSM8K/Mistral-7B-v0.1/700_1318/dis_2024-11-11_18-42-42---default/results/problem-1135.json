Hence, 'the final statement', i.e., \"there were\" could only imply : the initial question asking about what was found before conclusion or summarization as such statements generally express results rather than posing problems itself. This implies the task here can interpret multiple ways depending upon whether one considers this extra part(previously missing out!)of information important while providing direct answers like provided earlier OR treats these parts strictly adhering their contextual role without making inferences beyond those specified initially asked thus leading towards original setups & calculations not influenced post facto adding new elements.(As per usual case). Therefore according to latter view both sets including previously omitting info might sound accurate but based directly over interpreted tasks instructions/questions presented first don\u2019t involve considering additional details hence better stick closer following primary guidelines mentioned just involving main content stated specifically!
