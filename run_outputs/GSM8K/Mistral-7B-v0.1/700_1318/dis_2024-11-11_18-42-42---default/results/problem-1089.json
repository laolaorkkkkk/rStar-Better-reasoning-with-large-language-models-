To find out how high the ball goes on its next upward motion or 'second bounce', calculate this proportion again based off the last known value (the initial fall being considered as no prior action). We\u2019ll use the same multiplication principle here i.e., Second_bounce_Height=Hf1*(Fractional_rate^number_of_actions->SBh=((48 Feet))^(2/3)-> SBh =  \u221b ((48)^2 ) approx.= ~13 ft. ",
        " height reached during the first bounce would be (2/3) * 72 feet = 48 feet. To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce we repeat the calculation using the height achieved during the first bounce instead of original drop height. Therefore, the height obtained during the second bounce equals ((2/3)*(the previous bounce\u2019s peak))=(2/3)*48=32 feet. Thus, upon reaching its zenith during the latter stage, this specific sphere ascends no higher than forty-eight inches above the terra firma level within said mercantile establishment.\"",

By substituting '`starting_height`' as 24*3(stories) , or simply put 'x', into your formula : first_bounce= `(24*3)*(2/3)`, therefore equals twenty-four (`\"24\"`), hence `\"24 feets\".`.
