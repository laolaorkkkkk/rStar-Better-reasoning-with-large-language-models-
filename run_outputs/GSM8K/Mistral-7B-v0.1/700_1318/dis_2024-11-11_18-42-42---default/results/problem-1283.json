Hence when you subtract the value obtained earlier ($$),the net gain can simply stated thus;$\\dfrac{amount\\quad earned}{total \\enspace expenditure}=\\dfrac{(p)}{t}$ hence $\\dfrac{($)($$)}}{$()} =\\frac {((}($)$$)$. Simplifying this equation yields our simple conclusion,Frenchess gained $()$ remaining from its original state which happens to equal zero!

To calculate this latter value let us find out how much was spent firstly as below ; since it costs frances $4/tray what would happen when all those prices multiplied times their quantity ? Indeed , if you multiply 5(number of items purchased)with its associated price($4),the resulting outcome shows up : thus far spending $$$20 altogether . Hence summed overall income turns into $(amount gained)+$(price paid); substituting values mentioned above gets me herein totalling back againto$$$80+(minus)$$$-20=(plus)$$$60 .

Which equals ($) 60 remaining so if she saved all earnings this would equate to having ((saved)*remaining)/earned months^(-1)(month^-1). Since its only single month,(days aren\u2019t relevant),(weeks don\u2019t matter),and no interest rate:(no present value!!)which simplifies our equation down to:$ saving/(month)^ (-1 )so using substitution since I said earlier((60)$/$);then..final solution:=$$$ savng=$(60*$)/(1$(month))$=> $(1 hour)$.And hereafter you can go about calculating different time frames such as weekly or daily but those weren\u2019t needed anyways!.
