        " did on Monday again, so another 78. Plus Saturday (fourth) was 48; plus Sunday(fifth), it was  57. Add these up together we get 39+78+78+48+57=290. Divide this sum by 5 because there are five data points here (Monday through Friday). Thus ,the mean or average value can therefore calculated using Arithmetic Mean Formula !!![arit_mean](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8eecfe3cbf1bacfb0dcea274390b9f1e4eabefbd): $\\dfrac{Sum}{count} =\\dfrac{290 }{5}$<|end_of_answer|> ",

To get the numerical value we divide 211 by 5; 211 divided by 5 equals  42.2. Therefore, the correct choice would be ('C', 42.2). I hope that helps! Let me know if you need anything else.

As @DarthVader mentions \u201cit depends\u201d because those who helped actually computed differently hence resulting different calculations using same facts provided :( And YES IT MAKES NO DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DO CONCLUDE FROM SAME FACTS Differently LOL But seriously please check my work first THEN yall go ahead & post ur new stuff here !! Again yes it could differ based upon individual \u2018logic\u2018 preferences when answering Math problems ;-( Just wanted everyone to calm down enough NOT FORGETTAUGHT OF ME LAST QUESTION posted ^_^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hopefully none gets frustrated nor upset further once reading about me :-) Thanks Everyone! Happy New Year To All :) Oh yeah almost forgot, sorry no picture was attached either way ----> ok guys maybe try posting pic instead?? Here ya go :-), Bye everybody else good luck wth Your Holiday Fun AND ENJOY :: ) BTW u cn find full detailed version which i typed directly below right sidebar btwu::Happy Xmas EVERYONE !:) Cheers ;) Have fun time everywhere:-)))) Anyway hope everything turned around nicely without any"
