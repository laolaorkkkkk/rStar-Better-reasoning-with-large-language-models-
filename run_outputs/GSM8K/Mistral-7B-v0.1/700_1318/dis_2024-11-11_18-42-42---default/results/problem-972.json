Initially, she purchased 12; then gifted away another four (to both parents), meaning remaining are calculated as follows:  12 boxes \u2013 4 boxes = 8 boxes remain with her. Knowing one full container holds 20 items means we need this quantity multiplied by eight containers equals... 8x20= 160 units which represent oranges here. Consider what portion Mrs. Harrington decided not to keep. As mentioned earlier only one quarter stayed within hers own possession while three quarters went into sale eventually thereby representing .75 fractional value against whole i.e., all available orange count divided among sales(not keeping). It translates mathematically thus\u2026 160oranges/.75=.21kiloquats Thus concluding correctly stated numerically implies selling approximately around hundreds but precise figure would require exact unit identification like kilogrammes hence making said representation unclear yet sufficiently suggesting majority off these harvested citrus fruits find purchase via commerce activities post their separation processes executed dutifully abiding standardized measurements adherence protocol ensuring fair consumer satisfaction prospect upheld throughout entirety duration existence commencing point birth till demise finale juncture completion phase termination events culmination stages terminal conclusion signifying definitive event resolution process ceasing operation initiation proceedings cessation procedures enforcement actions imposed resulting legal judgments issued binding outcomes applied universally amongst entities engaging participatory roles alike stakeholders observers direct participants secondary supplementary assistants affiliated support service providers etc..

Remember we know one box houses twenty(twenty=dice), hence multiplying these results obtaining only sixteen dozen forty units making up exactly thirty three thousand seven hundred sixty (three*thirty third zero seventy ) individual Oranges altogether inside this eight Boxes distribution mentioned earlier before any action was executed upon such quantity.

Determine how many boxes remain after these transactions; this can simply involve subtracting (remaining_boxes) using Python code as follows: remaining_boxes = initial_number_of_boxes \u2212 boxes_given_away print(\"Boxes Remained : \", remaining_boxes). This leaves us with 12\u22124 = 8 boxes still owned by Mrs. Harrington. Calculate the fraction of these boxes which remained untouched following selling activity i.e., \\( \\frac{Remainder}{initial\\_quantity} \\) here remainder refers to Box count post gifting while quantity corresponds to Quantity before any alteration during shopping session. Using python we calculate it like so Fraction_untouched = \\(\\frac{\\text { Boxes Remained }}{\\text { Initial Number Of Boxes}}\\), substituting values obtained prior Mathmatical operations yield value roughly around ~\\(\\frac{8}{12}\\) =  0.666 .
