Firstly, if you add those other original ten preexisting things (which would represent one full box) plus the extra thousand or so made available via these previous contributions(five individual ones), it puts them around fifteen hundred or something like that. And because every single place holds only twenty times \u2013 well let me write down what was just said again..fifteen zeroes minus three zeros which equals twelve tens right off...then remember too our starting point being exactly seventy seven percent complete even though no actual numbers existed yet but instead merely quantities represented through language both numerically expressed within text form itself i mean obviously math isn\u2019t involved quite not necessarily speaking figuratively however perhaps actually literally since terms such as thousands hundreds etc all refer directly towards values associated purely mathematical principles despite using descriptive words otherwise known colloquial terminology used mostly when describing physical objects rather abstract ideas unlike pure arithmetic calculation methods required whenever dealing precisely scientific calculations often referred specifically relational mathematical concepts called algebraic expressions involving variables versus fixed constants typical numerical sequences lacking contextual interpretation unless comparing specific results obtained along way into proceedings thereby producing exact measurements based upon prior knowledge gained during experimentation testing procedures conducted following standardized protocol steps followed according set rules governing various disciplines including science engineering mathematics physics chemistry biology computer programming software development information technology cybersecurity research methodologies statistical analysis hypothesis generation evaluation result validation verification reliability confidence intervals sensitivity accuracy precision tolerance error detection correction algorithm optimization techniques problem solving skills critical thinking abilities creativity innovative approaches logical reasoning analytic mindset decision making processes rationalization qualitative data quantitatively derived conclusions drawn insightful observations generalizations pattern recognition trends identified correlations established causal relationships cause effect relationship deterministic laws emerged theoretical frameworks constructed empirical models developed hypotheses tested validated supported theories refuted falsified invalid revised generalized unified explanations universality principle discovered unknown connections revealed hidden patterns observed previously invisible structures perceived underlying mechanisms exposed concealed phenomena understood hitherto obfuscated mysteries solved problems encountered challenges overcome obstacles surmounted difficulties conquered adversaries defeated enemies triumph victories achieved success celebrated acclaim recognized achievements bestowed awards presented prizes won glory honored decorated hero praised publicized commemorated memorials erected statues named streets christened monuments built landmarks created foundations laid groundwork prepared infrastructure implemented projects completed tasks",
