        " One sub sandwich holds four (4) meatballs per submerged portion size \u00d7 seven(7). It was reduced further when mark took away 4 meatloaf pizzas leaving only six remaining . Plus , Sidney orders additional setups so let ' s say these contain equal numbers as earlier ones hence containing also same sizes i.e  4\u00d73=12  Thus we can conclude Total Sub Sandwiches Containing Meat Balls are :   7+3=10 These came back up to include all meats inside them thus concluding their amount would go like this     Four portions multiplied across those subs equals     4\u00d710=. Therefore it means together ,the various sections consisting solely of bread consisted of exactly        forty (.40) meatballs altogether Meaning therefore if you subtract these twenty (!!) items off out right here meaning your going down below zero !!!! But since no bun bits or such things could ever consume themselves into lower limits but rather above !! No way because nothing happens over infinity .........so obviously our first approach .....was wrong ...now comes my new formula.... First calculate Number of original substances based upon countable units within container..Then consider factual possibility of consumption without regard toward negative values due To reality Check!Now apply fresh understanding gained via thought process described directly prior Here begins calculation NOW You see We counted eight (8) separate servings comprising actual consumable food stuff while exempting stale crust etc Only using what makes perfect sense according not just logic alone Which Is Reality As Seen Through Clear Eyes Unblindfolded By Preconceived Notion And Biases From Past Confrontation With Existence Of Life That Can Be Perceived Directly Such Intelligent Observation Without Assumptions Produces True Results Every Time Because This Method Follows Scientific Rigor Just Like Any Test Should ; I Hope THIS IS THE ",
