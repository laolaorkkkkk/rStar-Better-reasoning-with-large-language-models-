To get this amount multiply both sides times ((books%) / remaining %) or $(0.01)$/(1-(remaining percentage)). Thus resultant loss=(cost -(delivery))/$(.01)/{1-.75} Since .75 represents 75%, thus its equivalent decimal value=.75/.1=.75*.1=-.75 Therefore our missing factor equals (-loss) ./ {(subtraction)}^-(-0.75) Which means multiplying subtractions across numerator $-0.75,(returning rate subtract )^/-0.75; therefore deliver expense:(deliveries)^-(/books%).

Multiplying this fraction against initial payment results in no change meaning buyers shouldn\u2019t expect anything else other that original value minus handling costs which come out here as calculated before being just under $.64 off making net payback about halfway down route yet still higher when considering taxes fees etc charged upfront due partially caused since customer didnnt use proper service provider who knows best rates otherwise might risk scams lowering satisfaction level greatly diminishing trustworthiness leading further losses overall long term if unmonitored correctly without careful consideration ensuring fair pricing especially important whenever shopping online because consumers prefer knowing exactly why particular product seller may decide not offer discount based upon their previous experiences using others offering similar goods while also providing detailed explanations regarding reasons behind such decisions although most likely these factors wouldntn necessarily apply either individually nor collectively unless truly necessary according too industry standards however sometimes simply asking directly can get straight answers rather confusing situations occurring almost automatically regardless even though both parties try hard enough trying understand underlying motives usually stemming purely financial ones particularly amongst sellers whom tend mostly avoid answering basic simple requests easily handled instead focus solely towards maximizing profits despite potential drawbacks relating negatively affect stakeholder relations potentially causing irreparable harm over time thus detrimental impact consequently resulting significant negative feedback received generally regarded unfavorably throughout community hence damaging reputation significantly reducing sales prospect therefore necessitating immediate improvement measures taken immediately followed closely monitoring progress continuously adjust prices accordingly until satisfactory outcome achieved subsequently improving standing among various competitors allowing better opportunities accessing markets worldwide ultimately expanding business operations globally generating substantial revenue stream proving successful strategies implemented effectively yield positive result thereby supporting growth efforts moving forward albeit carefully balancing risks involved associated challenges faced daily facing increasing competition constantly seeking edge gain greater market share capturing increased demand created surge requiring constant innovation maintain relevance remain ahead peer group successfully attract target audience motivated investment driving expansion ventures enabling rapid scale acceleration promoting healthy profitability levels sustaining steady performance benefiting all participants equally helping build strong foundation essential foundational pillars required building vibrant communities working collaboratively toward shared vision creating win wining environments prosperous economies contributing positively",
        " (weight_pounds*price_per_lb) + ((distance/mile)*rate). This equals (4*$0.35)+((20/$1))*$0.08=$3$. Since Amazon would likefully reimburse half this ($16), but costs him all three books returning them so net loss= $-1$ dollar. It means that instead of breaking even it results as if Milly paid negative amount thereby incurring losses worth one whole dollar thus making no profit . But considering initial expense outlay against gain or income earned; while initially calculating expected gains appears quite profitable , however factor actual delivery charge into equation & its clear why overall outcome stands unfavorably when evaluated monetarily because excessive deliver chargesexceed earnings leaving customer effectively paying higher than original investment justifying discontent expressed towards product quality itself hence prompt reasoning behind such complaints leading customers back overpriced products seeking alternate better deals elsewhere without needless extravagance attributed solely toward high maintenance fees borne primarily due oversight within business strategic planning domain failing accountability standards setting expectations mismatch consequently hindering competitive edge market penetration efforts detrimental commercial growth potential potentially impactful shareholder returns negatively affecting stakeholders long term relationships compromised trust undermining established brand reputation critical factors driving consumer decision processes preferences influencing purchasing behaviors decisions made based upon perceived value proposition versus transaction prices rendered dissatisfaction experienced stemming directly correlated relationship dynamics inherent complexities existing operational protocol procedures governing fiscal responsibilities ensuring transparent integrity transparency reinforced confidence vital maintainable harmony sustainable viable enterprise progress facilitator optimizing financial resource utilization efficiency elevating standard performance benchmark assessments further promoting continual process optimization enhancements beneficial organizational objectives advancement enhancing both internal satisfaction level amongst workforce individuals corporate entities collaborative partnerships external audience engagement fostered mutually advantageous exchange platform catalyzing prolific innovation stimulating groundbreaking achievements contributing positively global economic development environment encouragement cultural diversity tolerance inclusivity embracing equality respect dignified human rights principles social justice advocacy initiatives address societal challenges tackling existential crises confront current issues impasse providing constructive resolution path forward aspiring visionary transformation future paradigm shift collective consciousness"
