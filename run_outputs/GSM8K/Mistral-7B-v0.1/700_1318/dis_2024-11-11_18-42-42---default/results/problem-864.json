Total consumptions would hence come out differently considering individual distributions.(In case if one assumed full distribution towards everybody irrespective), therefore, assuming equal shares might change our outcome based calculations here due difference in approach adopted during allocation .

Based off knowledge gathered thus far regarding quantity allocations across differing age groups throughout previous events such school fundraisers etc., it becomes quite evident when attempting calculations relating towards resource allocation amongst subgroups having distinct requirements respectively due mostly often being related specifically according directly correlational factors which involve specific attributes linked intrinsically primarily either internally/externally rather independently relative comparison metrics utilized mainly commonly used alongside numerical analogy purposes whenever making comparisons among various similar situations involving human behaviour occurrences normally associated regularly observed behaviours exhibited generally typical characteristics shown frequently common examples typically applicable universally usually broadly recognized overall trends globally acknowledged accepted normals widely known facts regarded customary habits developed standard practices practiced routinely routine activities undertaken almost invariably applied uniformly regardless individual differences varied circumstances special cases unusual situation exceptional anomaly particular instance peculiar circumstance rare occurrence singular incident isolated example unique case extraordinary outlier uncommon deviation deviant abnormality irregular variation nonstandard pattern irregular frequency sporadic aberration oddball rarer form infrequent rate incidence increased low probability happening decrease likelihood declining ratio diminishing fraction decrement decelerated growth slow expansion retardant reduction regressive regression restrained regulation resistive impediment impeding interruption intimation intervene obstruct opposition oppose prohibit prevent hinder halt stop forbid barricade block encumber enchain constrain entrap ensnare capture trap restrict confiscate check stall forestall frustrate ferret find fodder faulty folly foolishness foible flaunt flummox feeble fail fall flat farewell fade falter fight forceful floppiness frazzle fragility frolic freely fly flutter funk fungous fundamental factual familiar favorable felicity feigned fickleness fieldfield footfall frightened friability friendliness furiously gallop glad gleefully generous genial genuine gemini ghetto glide glissando gloaming glaciate goldglitter",
