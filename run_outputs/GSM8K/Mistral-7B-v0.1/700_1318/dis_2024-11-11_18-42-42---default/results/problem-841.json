        " ($10000) and the phone ($800), which equals $10000 + $800= $10800. Next find out how much money Gabrielle already possesses (his own earnings plus what his brother gave). That totals up as follows; $5000 (what Gabriel earned himself)+ $200(from Greg)=$5200 . To determine how much money Gabriel still requires subtract this value of what Gabriel currently possess($5200) from the price combined worth of both items i.e.,Car & Phone collectively costing together=$10800-(Currently possessable Amount)$5200 , hence,$10800-$5200=5600$. Thus Gabriel needs further payment/money equivalent to \"$5600\".",
        " we account for what Gregory already owns (his earned wages plus whatever gift was provided). That\u2019s all together equals 5000+200=$5200 . To find out how much extra money Gilbert needed subtract current funds from costs so overall cost minus available funds results in , i.e., required additional expenses equaling $10800-$5200=$5600 ! Hence missing balance due amounts as this value stands presently without any other inputs or changes indicated within problem scope equate accordingly leading us towards our solution statement 'the figure calculated previously holds fast till further relevant factors come into play.'

To find out if this combination covers all costs without necessitating further loaning or borrowings, subtract what Gabriel already holds off against the desired cost; i.e., $10800-$5200. Therefore resulting calculation as follows : Subtract Samuel\u2019s available funds (=$5200) from required purchases price (=sum of item values=$10800): -> $10800-$5200= =>Resultant value->=>Samuel would therefore require additional funding equivalent equal to \"$5600\" [the remainder] to securely purchase these listed goods.\r",

Subtracting what he was able to gather (i.e., subtract its value against the desired amount): His savings being used cannot cover all necessities; thus one can calculate as follows : Total price needed minus available funds equals shortfall or debt ; i.e.: Shortfalls would come out like this if using subtraction methodology , herein referred as \u201cshortfall equation\u201d formula(debt)\u2236Price/Cost-(Earnings & donations)=Shortfall hence $$Total cost\u2009\u2014\u200aAmount currently accessible$$ which results into $$\\$10800\\\\-$\\,{\\\\(${}5200$)}\\\\=$,\\,\\, {}\\,$ \\ 5600.$$ Hence,  5600 US Dollars remains unaffordable without getting additional financial aid.$<|end_of_document|> The ",

Therefore, based off our calculations we can conclude here that Gabe needs another ~$5600to make his purchases possible.. As such my calculation provides us with evidence toward being able* to draw upon logic when considering numerical values associated via subtraction(*meaning I don`\u00b4 use parenthesis because those show multiplication order)*involving negative numbers during computation*, thus allowing me reachforth towards providing you readerswith insightful & useful tipsregarding common arithmeticoperationsthat individuals mayfairengage while dealing with daily affairs concerning monetaryexchangesand financial management*.",
