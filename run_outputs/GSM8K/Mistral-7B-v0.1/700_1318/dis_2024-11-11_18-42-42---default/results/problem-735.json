Subtracting this percentage from 100%, because every vote adds up exactly to 100%, leaves us 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes unaccounted for.

It only matters when adding up totals across different groups based off those proportions since otherwise both parts remain proportionate regardless their scale sizes...so basically every individual supports one group equally irrespective size variations among smaller ones compared against bigger counterparts having lower percentages but making similar impact per capita vs absolute magnitude differences due scaling ratios affecting outcome calculations even though proportionality stays intact\u2026but donot forget!

It seems like I am missing something here cause as long as you keep multiplying it never actually reaches anything even nearing right order or results... Try doing division instead! Okay my bad\u2026 Yes indeed when dividing things seem clearer because their values become proportional whereas multiples make them nonlinearly scaled based upon certain amount but not others thus making impossible calculations possible henceforth causing confusion amongst yourself until solved correctly!!

        " adding another half or 50%) equals 30%. Therefore, candidate B received 30 votes as percentage translates directly into actual count because our sample size is one hundred which makes percentages translate easily into counts without needing division further down stream. As such, candidates A+B together garnered 50 out of 100 possible votes leaving us just simple subtraction required here i.e., what remains once you remove their collective vote share form entire electorate pool would equate exactly your remaining quota hence finally round off this arithmetic operation leads conclusion about who won & its magnitude .

Hence if there were exactly one hundred voters cast their ballot for various political parties; outright winner could not determine because three or four candidates received equal percentages! But since this question assumes only three nominees competed against others altogether during elections held across counties within state boundaries covering territories encompassing diverse communities inhabiting varied locations like urban regions possess multiple housing schemes juxtaposed amongst traditional settlement areas etc.; therefore results indicate uniform distribution pertaining these places hence winning party might well derive additional seats beyond general expectations owing factors such changing demographics affect decisions outcome making them unpredictable except perhaps under extraordinary circumstances resulting unexpected shifts away existing power structures thereby rendering conventional wisdom obsolete no matter what evidence indicates otherwise contrary belief persisted until recently though often ignored particularly among analyst experts whose assessment skills remain critical despite limited access tools provided presently available thanks partially attributable largely lack knowledgeability concerning issues specific interest relevant stakeholder group thus necessitating further research investigatory efforts yet another methodology employed involves applying simple mathematical equations involving basic arithmetic operations upon collected data acquired via internet search engines employing numerous websites listed below respectively referred above example illustration showing sample calculation steps demonstrating technique applied herein namely using weight assigned according certainty criterion based primarily scientific principles utilized throughout history developed mainly following breakthrough discovery achieved several centuries ago when pioneer scholars discovered relationship existed exists inherently intrinsic nature physical laws governing phenomena observed naturally occurring events taking place outside realms human comprehension ever expand increasingly limitless vastness universe continuously evolving dynamic process continually subject variable change constantly varying parameters transform over time due constant motion movements particles energy forms waves oscillations harmonic frequency patterns cycles periodicity repeating regular sequence predictive models accuracy improve precision calculations becoming exact measurements ref",

But even though both methods work fine here I chose simple division over adding numbers together since its faster easier understandable when dealing solely/primarily wiht whole figures rather ratios etc...

Since this method involves just guessing until you reach your goal, let us find another way. First off it helps reduce ambiguity when comparing percentages, so I am going change up my working plan slightly. Instead of trying multiples of everyone together or anything complicated like ratioing everything out, lets consider splitting into sections first \u2013 one whole section being equivalent to every single person who cast their ballot; including those whose votes fell onto candidates besides A & B because collectively these constitute half+ of voting population based upon prior info provided above pertaining specifically towards respective proportionate share(%) attributed within realms allocated among said entities below\u2026 As such: Half %^=%.

        " This means candidate B received 50/100 (or half) as many additional votes as candidate A which translates into another 20% vote count because 20*50=100%. Thus, candidate B garnered 20%+20%=40% or 40 out of 100 votes since we presume 100 voters here. Adding up candidates A\u2019s and B\u2019s results \u2013 i.e., their combined share represents 60% (.i.e,. 60%)of all valid votes cast. Hence it follows logically that remaining percentage points translate directly onto our target interest group namely; those who voted candidate C forward. Subtraction confirms this logic mathematically too! Specifically : Percentage allocated toward successful parties within whole electorate minus summed percentages representing winning factions yields leftover values attributable solely towards last standing individual entity \u2014 viz.; nonvoting third participant referred previously under question prompt label 'candidate c'. Here specifically , such computation returns just one single value\u2014one hundred multiplied against its counterpart portion divided twice via mathematical rules followed consecutively mentioned above .

That leaves us with 10% as candidate C\u2019s percentage share of all vote counts. And if there were overall 100 voters, hence candidate C won 10/100*100=10 votes. ",
        " 10%. As we know 1 vote equals one percentage point when it comes to whole numbers like this question asks us so if candidates received either 2%, or 1%, these would translate into respective amounts as follows; Total Voters X Percentage Received / 100 per person Therefore, using the same formula above for Candidate C only who received all remaining points according to percentages calculated below: **Total Number Of Students**=  100 , **Number % That Will Go To Candidate c**=. Given that you already established what everyone else took here :A    .      %.B     .       %.C          %.Then just plug your data values inside our basic calculation model thus having something resembling(or nearly)the following equation:`Votes_For`=`Students*Percent/100;`Where `*`denotes multiplication(`x`), `/`indicates division (`\u00f7`). This implies replacing any placeholding symbols in those variables shown previously before inserting them respectively.`So, putting everything together such that their appropriate symbol placement becomes apparentwe can rewrite the statement as...\\[total_{students}\\](StudentCount)\\times \\frac{c\\_percent}{100} (\\frac{|votes|}{studentcount})Now time to crunch! Putting everything correctly back intothe correct order....

This signifies what we already know..Each individual here being representative equals\u2026or shares exactly \u2018n\u2019 parts , say 'm', such when multiplied together yields m^3 ..which upon simplifying would yield something along these lines:- m^(x)\u2217y...with y representing all remaining portions belonging purely unto ourselves !
