Since we know that Aaron took less time since he could speed up faster when compared to Vanessa ,he completes both parts which adds upto half hour or 30minutes together . Therefore  Both runs taken separately add back up to this figure meaning Vanessa covered only one third because although she covers double distance still she gets slowest being not very good runner hence needed greater times.(Vanessa also can cover just like four quarters equals whole i.e., full pizza.) We get Time Taken By Vanessa=Third Of Total Run Distance\u00d7Total Running Time=(4/T)(30)=40. This means Even though even thought Vanessa\u2019s maximum covering capacity doubles hers ability comes slower thus increasing overall timing considerably making her slightly lagging behind due to lower efficiency while having same range coverage capability compare to Aaron.. Thus you see different things happens here depending upon individual strength vs weaknesses present among them during their races\u2026and results vary accordingly! But eventually all factors considered make Vanna finish later indeed\u2013even though sometimes competitive spirit might encourage trying harder!! Although initially calculating seemed simple enough using formulas used earlier let us reconsider taking average speeds into consideration too instead basing conclusions solely off those alone ; otherwise our calculations may turn out somewhat skewed towards unrealistic expectations resulting negatives impact once again affect outcome badly!.

Let X represent time spent completing this task per quarter marathon; it works because we know how Vanessa runs half times those distances compared to what Aaron can handle so divide or multiply appropriately depending on situation while taking into consideration comparative rates which involves comparing ratios against one another when dealing with relative rate problems . Since all variables change proportionally under normal circumstances such relationships become direct ones making solving simpler overall through application proportionality principles like cross multiplication among other techniques suited well toward these cases allowing us effectively utilize properties associated related directly correspondingly within respective context involving ratio relations typically found commonplace across wide range scientific studies focused specifically towards fields heavily involved studying phenomena based upon quantitative measurable attributes often referred colloquialy 'ranges'.

This makes sense because this situation involves halves since you need to double or quadruple something to achieve these ratios appropriately\u2014for example, doubling distance equals quartering the pace; hence multiplying vanessas original time taken per mile becomes appropriate here due to dividing their speeds respectively.(Note also : When doing unit conversions use equations involving fractions directly instead of trying to 'force fit', using algebra.)

        " But we know it took him exactly half the time since our speeds were different (his ratio would still remain constant). Thus if Aaron needed only 16 minutes or just under one minute per mile according to this logic, calculating times doesn\u2019t apply here directly without knowing their specific distance Vanda covers within those 16 minutes because unlike typical scenarios involving direct comparison of distances covered rather than individual rates; however let us try another approach instead! Here I am assuming both individuals maintained consistent paces throughout respective laps hence maintaining uniform linear motion along straight paths . Suppose you also account for rest periods like drink breaks ? It wouldn't matter mathematically speaking either way though ; what matters most , i s whether these changes cause significant alterations suchas slowdown during fatigue over extended duration spans .. so why worry when simplicity works well enough !",
