One can assume this question comes second because I assumed you knew something already due to me asking previous related questions beforehand such as if multiplying doubles your output but halves when dividing... Also please remember multiplication here means combining groups together while division splits things up further thus reducing amounts overall meaning larger values become smaller ones!

We can determine this equation using variables: Let L represent Leo's Age (what we want), let M stand for Marcus who knows to equal D/2 which equals ((L / 2) == (D - 5)). Substitute deanna into our equation; replace every instances of \u2018deanna(d)' in your last resultant expression with \u2019Deanna.\u201d so it reads [(L/2)==(26-(5))] solve both sides. multiply side one [2*(L)]=side two [(26 \u2013 5)*2] equate them together [2*L]=[RHS value]. simplify RHS further \\[LEFT SIDE==RIGHT SIDE \\] divide through .\\[L==((26)-5)/2\\] evaluate \\[(left Side)==rightSide]\\[L==21./2\u3011Simplifying yields \\[\\lbrackLEOsA{WrGvwTZjxKyHNYzC=\\frac{1}{2}\\Left]{oXiJqfFyPpBmMnDmVgUxE\\hspace{0.1cm} o}=21.\\](Right ",

        " is (Deanna\u2019s age \u2013 5) which means Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Since Marcus is exactly half as old as Leon, so we can conclude that Leopold was twice ages of Marcus meaning LEO_AGE=MARCUS*2=>LEO_AGE=21*2 =>LEO_AGE=42. ",
        " Since Marcus is also half of Leo's age, we multiply Marco's age (11) twice since it represents only one quarter or three quarters of Luo's current ages. Thus, Leo\u2019s age would equal 11*2 equals 22 plus another multiplied portion representing other third(a part not accounted before), which when divided evenly among those triple parts results into six sixths equivalent fractions i.e., twelve twentyfourth portions/parts making fourteen fifteenths or approximately eleven point seven sevenths as being roughly ten whole numbers older. Therefore, if you substitute back values using equation formulas accordingly; m=l\u00f72+\u22125 & D=m+=\u22125 finally leading down this pathway yields our resultant solution lying somewhere near round about count within range bounded through linear scale factors based upon mathematical logic derived during computations processed herein thus thereby arriving conclusively unto correctness found via systematic methodologies applied towards determining suitable quantitative answers satisfying particular queries concerning numerical relationships amongst said subject matter addressed pertaining specifically thereto specific problem set forth initially posited henceforth referred above wheretofore elaborated throughout successive analytical discussions commencing immediately subsequent sequence progression stemming forwardwards sequentially aligned temporal constructors contiguous yet preceding presently mentioned delineation initiatewith reference designatingthereinafterthisprecedingpassage proceedesthroughtodaysunderstandingspertainingeighthefutureproceedstillfurtherinthesociologicalperspectivesconcerningvariabilityamongthesubjectspeckledinterpretabilitiesinculturaldiversecontextssummarizedthroughcomparablestatisticsanalogouslyquantifieddatavisuallyvisualisethroughcommonpictorialrepresentationsdiscussesmathematicallymodelelocexploreshowfindsaidsimpleclearintelligibilitygainsinsciencebasedknowledgeapplicationthenewresearchfieldstudyingsubjectareacomplexitiesunravelsimplerfundamentalslearnmoreaboutspecificsubdomainsuchasgenomicsbiochemistryorphysiologywhichfocusoncellularlevelphenomenadetailorganismaryourselvesexperimentontopathogenicfactorsimplyinghumanbodysystemoperationalfunctionspotentialoutcomesassumingmodificationsmadewhileinvestigatngnewtermsapplyfoundobservablesusingequationsandgraphmethodstoconstructaccuratelydeterminateresultsprecision",
        " M and hence Leonardo (Leo) must be L=2*M because one person being twice as another implies multiplication operation due to equality relation; while saying 'five years younger', we know it indicates subtraction operator since youngness equates to lesser quantity or value over time period when compared to others).
