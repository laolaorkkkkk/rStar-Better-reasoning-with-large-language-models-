Next identify the costs for a similar trip but instead using information about fees charged in the other scenario mentioned (second amusement). Two parents pay \\$14 \\cdot 2 = $ <<14*2=28>>28$, also another pair accounts for $\\$10 \\cdot 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20$: again let us find out what those numbers sum up to get them as one bundle (*i.e.* whole unit): $$\\text{cost}_{unit}=28+20=\\$48$ . Again noticing both scenarios involve trips covering exactly four people so calculate twice its value compared against just counting single visits---the savings achieved when choosing option B can hence simply be determined by comparing prices found earlier such as below --so far you don't necessarily need to go into details anymore because it doesn't affect your results.$$2\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{\\$172-\\$48}{\\$1}\\right)}_{\\text{number of units}}=(2)(124)$$?
