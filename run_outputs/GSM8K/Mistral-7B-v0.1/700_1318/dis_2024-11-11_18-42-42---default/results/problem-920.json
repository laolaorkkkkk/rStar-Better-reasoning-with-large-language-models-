Compute the number of fish according to their quantity relative to bunnies. From before we calculated it would mean Lawrence owns thrice the amount of fish compared to rabbits which means Lawrence has 7 * 3 (=21 Fish). Determine the count for Gerbils next since its stated as being one third but this time related to the sizeable group represented by the collective set of Nemo inhabitants known commonly under aquatic life forms or FISH respectively. This translates into him having exactly half a fractional part when considering fractions only whole parts matter here i.e., rounding downward making sure all pet counts remain integers . Hence keeping things tidy yet maintaining proportional integrity throughout larry\u2019s menagerie , your best shot approximating these calculations yields approximately LARRY_total_pets ~ ((sum up)+((halfFish)+roundDwarfMarsupials+(oneThirdofBunnyTotal))+catCount); By plugging values found through meticulous computation above : approxLARRY_total_pets=approximately rounded( sum([fish],[gerbil]))+( dogAmount )+ catQuantity ; Simplifying further allows efficient approximation via python coding logic execution methods such us arithmetic operators allowing youtube viewers & enthusiastic home brewers alike get immersion exposure learning experience about algorithmic thinking pattern solving skills !!!

Lastly identify the count of Gerbils based on its relation to Fish; It says it\u2019s \u2018a third the number of fish.\u2019 Which translates into calculating one-third or dividing 21(the numbers of fishes) equally among three groups leading us back up again to conclude that Larry owns exactly 7 Gerbils .

Lastly we see it says he\u2019s collected enough gerbils which equate into one third the quantity of fish, hence; (21) / 3=7. All together counting every pet type equals : Cats+Dogs+Rabbits+(Fish)+(Gerbils)= 3 catls +  9dogs + 7rabbitss + 21fishes + 7gerbilds .

Therefore, the number of Gerbil equals half of Number of Rabbit (half because we know he only keeps Fish) which results into having Half Multiplied By Three Rabbits Equals Total Dogs less Two Minus Cats(D=C+R). Or it could simply mean you divide sixteen rabits halved resulting eight plus or minus ten totalling eighteen instead if counting both sides evenly meaning adding up all pet numbers including fourteen seventeen Eighteen Twenty Fourteen Sixteen Seventeen Forty Nine.

Since Larry\u2019s Gerbil count is equal to one third (1 / 3)of what he possesses regarding fish(i.e., F = G), therefore; we can say Larry owns around ~7 Gerbils since half the amount of fish i.e,(half of twentyone ) or approximately seventeen divided by three yields seven (.33 rounded off).Sum up all these values together because you wanted to find out about every single pet type owned by Larry :Cats(3)+Dogs(9)+Rabbits(7)+Fish(.21)=+Gerbils~.(7).
