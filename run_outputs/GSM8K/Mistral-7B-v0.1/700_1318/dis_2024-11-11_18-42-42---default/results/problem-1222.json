        " amount of material needed if one requires double this measurement before rounding up as necessary since you can only purchase whole yards (wherein 1 yard equals 36 inches). Firstly we calculate twice the required length which equates to 2 * 175 = 350 inches. Since every yard consists of 36 inches; therefore we need to convert our measure into yards via division i.e., 350 / 36 resulting approximately in about 9.72 yards when rounded off considering commercial selling practices necessitate use/purchase of full measurements thus implying actual requirement would not precisely match mathematical computation. Hence, Luke should go ahead and buy ten complete yellow bags making sure enough extra covering space exists while still remaining efficient regarding resource usage without incurring surplus costs due excessive purchasing beyond minimal requirements henceforth maintaining ideal cost efficiency principles effectively managing monetary resources judiciously ensuring adequate coverage whilst preventing potential waste arising due oversight towards meticulous budget adherence strategies.
