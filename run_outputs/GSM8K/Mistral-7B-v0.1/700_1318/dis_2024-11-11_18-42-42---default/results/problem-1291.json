Further it says Sarah owns exactly half the quantity of what makes up Timothy\u2019s pen collection \u2013 hence dividing our previously found figure by 2 results into calculating Sarah's collections resulting in being equivalent to  54/2=27 pens . Hence summed together all individuals collectively hold or share amongst themselves namely George owning 18 pens , Timothy wielding precisely thrice George's ownership i.e., having 54 similar items(pens) while Sarah possesses notably fewer denoting only one fifth part belonging to their combined possession totalling 27 units respectively..

Splitting things down initially only helps keep track once division takes place next .. thus let\u2019s figure out these numbers individually : first take whatever came off because multiplication was performed previously onto its base form alone\u2026in other words :-George=(1) \u2013(\u2013(1))*(2)+(-)(-(1)).This turns around altogether ;thus yielding something similar like ??????We still don \u2019t know anything about any additional information regarding pen usage yet though!!
