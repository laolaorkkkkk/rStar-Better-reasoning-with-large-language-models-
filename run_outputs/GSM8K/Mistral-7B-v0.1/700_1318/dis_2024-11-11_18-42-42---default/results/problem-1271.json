Divide the original quantity (total) of red candies by one to get what fraction corresponds to these colors together; so you can figure out their combined weight because since we know exactly what color(s)/fraction represents all those items subtract them from our starting count of whole candies to see if remaining undetermined candies might not fall into any category represented above.\r"
