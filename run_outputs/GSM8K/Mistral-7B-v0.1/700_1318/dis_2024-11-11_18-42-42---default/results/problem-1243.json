It appears however somewhat unorthodoxy considering standard usage yet may suffice under special circumstances like such provided explanations above serve sufficiently sufficient context enough explanation clarifying any possible misunderstandings surrounding mathematical symbols etc..

Therefore dividing the new reduced overall cost ($15) amongst itself three times results into its actual worth per unit being equal $15/30=$0.5 approximately which equals half dollar or as you asked about cent equivalent would make sense if converted so multiplying .5*100cent =  50cents thus each single piece(or instead \u2018jerk\u2019 here) can potentially go anywhere near 50 cent depending upon any change returned back once payment happens making them cheaper but within reasonable limits than usual value otherwise set up due discount applied onto general selling model scenario based pricing structure normally adhering to industry standard regulations governing fair trade practices etc thereby setting expectations clear enough both parties involved agreeable towards terms associated during contract formation agreement signage underlining respective intentions relating such matters clearly avoid potential future misunderstandings stemming primarily arising confusion concerning ambiguous word interpretations misalignment resulting consequential losses either way suffered mostly benefitting recipient side whilst damaging transactor causing said harm inflicting negligence owing violation agreed upon parameters mutually consent established above specifically pointing point regarding initial transaction undertaken pursuing further business relations following concluded accord specifying mentioned points noteworthy clarifying explicitly detail delimiting scope coverage precisely limit applicable henceforth excluding subsequent interactions lacking explicit directives defining purpose intended service provisions entailed inherently presupposing continuity maintained post original engagement conferred accordingly assuming validated status granted precedent establishments dictate consistent expectation aligned performance ensuring customer satisfaction guaranteed via appropriate compensatory measures provided forthwith compliantly observed according specific law mandated requirements enforced uniformly without prejudice across board irrespective geographical locale circumstances prevailing impacting relevant particularities adjustment demanded accommodating exceptional needs unique attributes exhibited therefore implying willingness demonstrate open mind receptive approach reciprocity encourages reinforce trust base cultivated prior initiation fostering positive rapport building enhances prospect attractivity leverages capitalizes opportunity generated elevates likelihood success attained maximized growth outcome yields improved bottom line profitability increment translating directly enriched shareholder returns augment earnings distributions funneled straight down stock option pools",

But this time considering only the budgeted amount not including original tagged prices; hence dividing actual paid price by quantity provides us realistic figures i.e., $15/bag divided amongst all possible packagings equals about $.50 or half dollar coins representing $1-$cents value respectively therefore translating back into numerical representation results as follows: .50*100=50 cents thus making individual packet rate approximately 50 cent values within purchased context which indicates reduced pricing applied during sales promotional campaign thereby rendering customers satisfied concerning perceived economic advantageous scenarios without depleting overall profit margins whilst maintaining operational sustainability",

This equals .5$. But because your paying cent values instead please convert $.5$ amounts to its equivalent value when expressed as integer whole numbers in terms of pennies or cents rather than dollar fractional figures hence since (.5$) equates to half of ten units thus forty five percent (= .5*10), converting these numerals directly reveals fifty cent fractions i.e., .5*. Therefore dividing up quantities represents the price per piece meaning unit mass of meat product resulting herein implies consumption rates measured relative not in currency denominations but absolute integers expressible most efficiently via percentage representation rendering consumable resource quantification relatively consistent despite actual purchase volume variations yielding different monetary expenditure levels thereby effectively establishing budget neutrality across purchases irrespective material size differences allowing adjustment without affect overall spend minimization impact assuming constant market dynamics preserving consumer satisfaction threshold optimization regardless scale shifts maintaining optimal trade balance ensuring maximal utility maximized savings potential whilst guarantee full utilization rate prevention wasteful excess generation consequent oversupply exacerbation leading increased unsold surplus inventory generating further loss accruals due diminishing demand elasticity implying decreased competitive advantage translating marginal sales dropouts increasing net capital shortfall risk reducing business viability sustainablility prospects perpetuating longer term detrimental effects causing adverse feedback loop trigger accelerated attrition spiraling towards unavoidable operational failure unless prompt corrective intervention measures implemented restoring equilibrium within established economic parameters safeguarding long term interests aligning priorities accordingly optimizing returns throughout lifecycle fostering robust healthy growth trajectories facilitating resilient expansion strategic position reinforcement strengthening future readiness capabilities leveraging dynamic synergistic interactions among all involved entities enhancing collaborative performance achieving desired objectives deliverables satisfying customer expectations assuring quality standards excellence realization uphold brand reputation fortifying industry standing cultivating loyalty building positive social goodwill contributing indirect economics benefits multiplier effect stimulating additional",
