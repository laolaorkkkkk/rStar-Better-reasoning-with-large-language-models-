        " kg/dog = 15 kg. Repeat this process using information about Dog breeds B (Bulldogs) instead. Substitute known values into your calculation. Since both calculations yield amounts consumed during one day; multiply them together to get daily consumption rate across all dogs present: Daily consumption equals the sum of individual consumption rates or individually calculated weights multiplied as appropriate within its category\u2019s limits i.e., Total Daily Consumption=German Sheppards Sum(DietA)=Number Of GShepard*Each One DietA Per Day+Bullmoodies Sum(dietb)= NumberOfBullDogs*EachOneDBudgetPerDay To find out what their needs would be over multiple time periods divide current result value (=Total DogsEatCurrentAmount), which represents single period measures like \u201cone day\u201d, with constant measure units derived through dimensional analysis based upon specified unitary multiples required ie \u2018per hour\u2018 ,\u2018x hours,\u2019 etc. Here it means seven times our initial figure because we want results measured over weeks rather than just one single observation\u2014so calculate WeekConsumptionsForAllBreeds=. Calculate average Food NeededByDaysOverSevenPeriod[W]. Divide whole expression . Find difference! Addition yields desired outcome while subtraction provides comparison against baseline figures obtained initially via separate addition operations involving those respective quantities alone \u2014 thereby comparing subsequent performances relative original benchmark settings thus revealing deviations occurring throughout evaluation intervals set forth above mentioned parameters such distance traveled henceforth indicated alongside corresponding durations spent traversal route paths designated specifically herein prior examples used primarily illustrative purposes sole intended purpose namely educating readers conceptually understanding basic principles behind certain types applications discussed earlier lessons introduced therefore teaching methods employed utilizing technical terminology including mathematical notation symbols often encountered when describing procedures necessary solve problems related areas listed below listings presented firsthand experiences shared amongst practicing professionals working industry fields specialties under common umbrella term collectively referred back generically generalized notion encompasses broader scope beyond narrow categorizations sometimes difficult distinguishing similarities exist among various disciplines requiring deeper investigation specific circumstances surrounding particular issue arising unique solution approaches proposed considering factors influencing decision making processes crucial identify potential consequences associated risks taking action without careful consideration repercussions stemning actions undertaken potentially detriment effects resulting failure fulfill expectations created preliminary intent establishments founded groundwork already laid historical developments influenced events"
