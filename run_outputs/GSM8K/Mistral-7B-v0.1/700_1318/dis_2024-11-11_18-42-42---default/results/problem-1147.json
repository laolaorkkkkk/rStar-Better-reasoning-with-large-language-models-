        " To find out which scenario allows for fewer drawing days we need calculate both possibilities separately as follows; Starting Scenario (Large Sizes Only): We divide the desired quantity(size) by production rate to get time required : Large sizes only means 45 divided by six equals eight point five (so rounded up since you cannot work half a minute). Medium sized pictures first so starting off here : thirty six divides into sixty evenly meaning exactly one full working cycle but again remembering this happens every seven mins because its smaller than large size pics ,and therefore seventy minutes times two hours makes fourteen full cycles . But before adding those together let us look over what happened when calculating everything else simultaneously while including their respective numbers accordingly ; Three groups combined would mean fifteen divisions needed across three categories being equal amounts hence coming down onto just ten divisors overall plus extra ones if considering individual quantities within these groupings such maybe someone drew something wrong causing another task requiring additional efforts thus increasing timelines further yet maintaining same outputs elsewhere without affecting general productivity negatively amongst team members sharing responsibilities etc..

Thus using this information , Dx means time required which basically equals to : Dx=(Tl/L)+(Tm/M)+(Ts/Sm).
