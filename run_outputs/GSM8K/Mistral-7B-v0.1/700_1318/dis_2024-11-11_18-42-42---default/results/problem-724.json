        " That means there was initially 5 x 12 = 60 slices altogether. Bryce and three other people (so 4 out of 5) eat 2/3 of their pizzas. Since we know that one full pizza contains 12 slices so if you multiply this amount per person by what\u2019s equaling 2/3 fractional part i get: (2 / 3 )(12)= 8 since it says that only 3 persons ate them all together equals (8+8+8= 24). Two others who also consumed about 3 portions but instead just took up partial meals, which equate as follows (the whole numbers would signify taking less than expected because nobody could possibly complete even one slice): ((4)/4)(12)+((3*(1))/(4*3)*12)[which yields]=(16+(9)= 25 . Adding these amounts results into finding our original goal\u2014the amount not taken during dinner can therefore be calculated using subtraction like shown below:(total quantity)-(eaten portion)=quantity untouched thus,(60-(25))equals ,or rather becomes simply\u2026.  35!

This leaves us with [(2/3)*12]*3+[\u2074\u2044\u2083*12] amount of food uneaten which equals 24+8=32. To get this calculation process explained correctly we need these steps:- First calculate [\u00b2/\u00b3*12]: divide 12 into third parts i.e.,  12/3=. Fourth part :calculate fourth . subtract both divided numbers respectively(i.e,(12*.75)) ,from original.(ii).

That leaves us with 4 times as many untouched than touched because these people split what they took into thirds so only one piece remained undistributed for every slice taken . Therefore, we have about twice this amount still uneaten due to sharing among three \u2013 or around half not being taken outright compared to our original sample of 60 slices before anyone even began devouring anything! Hence approximately fifty eight whole ones go unaffected when multiplied further sixfold , resulting finally upon dividing once again amongst themselves all parties involved ; thus equalling sixty seven minus thirty percent which equals nearly seventy five points worth altogether without including any other additional factors involving portion sizes varying slightly throughout individual meals according different personal preferences etc\u2026 But nonetheless within reasonable margins regarding human consumption habits under normal circumstances concerning average appetite ranges typical herein observed during recreational activities pertaining specifically athletes participant groups such ourselves included who typically enjoy consuming copious amounts foodstuff ingredients alike whilst watching sports competitions via television media means whether live broadcasted events televised directly stream online pay service subscriptions offered respectively based mostly consumer demand rather solely predicated entirely purely chance occurrence occurring naturally incidental coincidentality neither reliably nor intentionally orchestrated purposefully designed efforts purposely conceived through artificial manipulation created intentional design construct aiming strategically toward maximizing revenue generating profits potential opportunities exploiting inherent structural market dynamics operative industry competition practices prevailingly affective influential economic conditions shaping broader societal trends thereby enabling business entity organization operations maintain stability ensuring sustainable long term prosperity benefiting consumers collectively overall welfare society holistic commonwealth comprehensive macroeconomics fundamental principles integral foundations systematized framework theory implementation practical application methodology quantitative model analytical technique econometrics statistical analysis financial forecasting simulation prediction decision making informed judgment sound advice guidance effective policymaking regulatory frameworks governing laws judicial interpretations normativenorman law ethos moral obligations social responsibility accountability transparency integrity public trust confidence community solidarity unity harmony cooperation collaboration synergies coherence mutual understanding empathy compassion kindness generosity mercy forgiveness tolerance acceptance diversity respect dignity recognition equality justice fair treatment humane behavior civilised conduct professionalism",

        "+8+9+9=  25. Since all six people initially consumed only one dozen or twelve slices per person, this means that altogether before anyone stopped consuming any additional portions, six times eleven plus twenty five equals eighty seven. Thus, since thirty three minus fifty may seem counterintuitive but actually results into seventeen fewer portions than being first used up, it can also mathematically mean not enough yet as still needs almost fifteen extra parts if everyone kept going beyond full consumption without regard towards having leftovers; hence we conclude our calculation based upon quantity vs desired remainder \u2013 so here you\u2019ll see clearly why despite looking like simple subtraction problem seems tricky due its unconventional nature especially when considering context versus pure math logic within same scenario!
