It may also seem like one might get tempted about asking regarding profit gained through resale while disregarding expense made beforehand, however such considerations shouldn\u2019t affect our solution here based directly upon input data provided within query , so let's keep going focusing onto main problem rather than side calculations .

Using ARPU formula we get:(amount*(revenue/units))=$(((ARPUNITSPC*pricegainPC)+bizopco)$ Here units refers to every full price transaction while pricing gain % is simply ((SRRPRICEGPCI)-(SRFPRICESKI)). Buzz factor could refer to something like social proof effect etc., business operating costs or discounting factors which reduce sales margins as well as brand value degradation due to aggressive market penetration strategy.)
