        " Secondly, she played 2hours per day for one week (That means during seven days). Thus, it amounts to another \\(2\\times 7=14\\)hrs.. Total time spent equals  21",
        " days which totals up 14 hrs. Therefore altogether it sums up (7+14) or 21hours. Subtracting these hours out of what needs to reach equals ((30)-(21))=9hrs.. ",
        " times (half an hour per day) which equals 7*0.5=3.5 hours/week multiplied by 2 weeks so this part totals up to 3.5*2=7 hours. During the last week, Kris played twice as long\u2014two hours every single day. We multiply two daily sessions time by seven days because one whole week includes seven consecutive days thus making it equal to  2 hrs/daily session \u00d7 7 daily days= 14 hours . Adding those results together we find out how far away Kris went towards reaching goal amount of gaming \u2014adding original target value to all these calculations sums us having already completed a huge chunk off our initial task\u2019target quantity\u2013i.e.-(total needed)+time spent completing tasks=-(-30+7+14)=12hours remain before getting coveted badge\u2009or\u200aachievement.<|end_of_document|>",
        " which equals 14 hours over the course of those two weeks. Next find out how long it takes them while gaming three times longer than before\u2014a whopping 1 hour/day or seven hardcore sitting sessions into one very productive Sunday through Friday session plus time spent recovering over the remaining two hallowed Sundays! Adding up all together we get: initial value \u2014 subtraction amount so far equal additional needs required until reaching desired result Final calculation would therefore look like this following expression : Initial Total Hours Desired Subtract Amount Earned till present Yearly Goal Additional Needed Time Left Required Calculation Result Value ",
        " Each day, she played for 2 hours. This made it one extra week times 2 hours a day which equals 7*2=14 additional hours across this period. Add these together so all three periods considered collectively resulted in;  14+14+(week)*hours needed = Hours already put into gaming    Total required time was noted as being exactly equal to 30 . Therefore subtracting what was previously achieved over those four separate but consecutive sessions results thusly;     X=(Total Gaming Time)-(Hours Already Played )X =30-(14+14)+Week*(2)= 2 hours remaining Week_(Time_Left)=\\frac{given \\space target \\ space-\\left[\\sum_{w=1}^{number\\quadofweeks}(days\\_per\\quadweek*{hour\\_spent}\\right]}{daily} =\\frac{(total~target ~time)\\ -\\ [(\\text {current sum})\\ (\\times hrs.\\ spent)]}{\\text {Dailly}}=\\frac{30\\,\\_\\,\\!-\\}\\,\\!\\!(14\\,\\,\\!\\!+\\,\\,\\,14)}{\\sim\\,2}\\,=\\,\\!2 DaysRemainingThis would indicate a requirement of roughly another twenty eight minutes before attainment can happen if no other changes occur outside regular planned activities.<|end_of_document|>",
        " per day x 7 days in a week = 14 hours. Add up all these three amounts which equals 14+14=28. Subtract this amount from what it takes to achieve the goal. It took 30 but we subtracted only 28 so add back those missing hrs;  30hrs \u2013 28hours = 2more needed hr(s). The answer is: 2."
