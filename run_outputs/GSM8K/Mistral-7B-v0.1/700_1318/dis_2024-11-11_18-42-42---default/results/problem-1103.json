Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{5} J \\) equals six since this amount changes color when exposed to UV lights; thus, \\(\\frac{1}{5} J = 6\\). To find the total, multiply both sides of the equation by five (\\(5*(\\frac{1}{5} J) = 5*6\\)), which simplifies down to just 'J'. This means that the total number of jellyfish before turning off the UV light was fifteen ('J'). However, because only half of these become larger once activated while keeping their original colors aside those changing into blues, let\u2019s call them X such as `(X+6)/2=6`. Solving that leads us back upwards through addition: `x+6=12`, hence subtracting leaves \u2018X` equal ten\u2014meaning eightteen remains but twenty four minus twelve plus three adds eleven so eighteen remain non-blue unchanged prior using red colored glasses adding our previous result multiplies summing leaving thirty seven overall present initially within said aquatic environment upon conclusion",
