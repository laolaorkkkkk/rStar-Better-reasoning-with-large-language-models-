Finally add up these values because we want the sum of both scores i.e., sum_of_scores=pierson+nicitas which equals to adding initial value plus calculated result thus resulting equation becomes Sum_Of_Scores=[eval(278+(278/2)+11)=457]. Therefore, if you ask about who threw fewer strikes considering their performances individually or together its not clear directly so no calculation could exactly depict this situation however scoring wise combining them shows combined effort totalling towards higher point margin indicating better overall performance comparative to individual efforts albeit striking numbers haven't necessarily been discussed here .
