To find out earnings over one second we start off knowing all machines produce their respective amounts regularly but I realized this question was asking about rates times time equaling money earned thus simplifying our calculations since multiplying fractions isn\u2019t necessary here We also know both rate variables represent minutes meaning my goal becomes figuring amount divided into six zeros because there \u2018re thirty seconds within one full period And lastly consider adding additional factors like losses or overhead expenses Those aren\u2019t important right Because ultimately profitability concerns revenue minus costs not necessarily what gets returned However keep those other elements under close watch While looking ahead remember breaking down complex equations using familiar mathematical concepts such assplicing ratios reducing units converting theminto smaller numbers eliminating any unnecessary details helping solve problems efficiently Also pay attention toopportunity cost opportunity means another choice available alternatives being considered along with best option overall Always strive making wise decisions ensuring optimal returns minimizing risks maximizing benefits Finally don \u2019ts worth mention But mostly just focus directly address issue provided above Which implies calculating differences comparing results when considering various scenarios Calculate potential income generating capacity subtract resulting difference representing financial advantage achieved When accounting solely based upon direct comparisons disregarding secondary effects unrelated specifically relevant Here goes calculation demonstration Step Number One Multiply productivity figures expressed via specific denominations Expressed numerically these values translate intothe following formulas X represents quantity produced daily Y denotes price tag P signifies entire production output Z refers annualized fiscal result Let me breakdown next steps assuming operating parameters identical throughout testing span Initial setup Assuming simultaneous usage across devices yield N equals average performance differential C illustrates conversion percentage V equates net proceed profits Required information Quantity Produced Per Hour Earnings/Rate Dollar Value Month Daily Year Week Daily Rush Production Time Period Profit Potential Gain Minutes Second Conversion Factor Equal Opposing Machine Totals Net Result Final outcome As follows Table below summarizes key stats presented earlier Column heading indicates corresponding data Variable Name Example Formula Unit Cost ($)/Production Output Qty($)=(P*X) /Y=((Price Tag)*Quantity Made )/(price charged) Money Saved Over Life Cycle [(N+C)+V]=$Amount saved annually [Productive Capacity Added]*Conversion Fraction=(",

Subtracting those numbers yields (60 \u2013 45), or 15 widgets better/hour made by this model over competitors\u2019 offerings within its price range(the first option). Since one piece usually retails around roughly half our example rate ($3 /$6= $.5 ), we double this value obtain approximately .5*15=$7\u00b75 extra revenue accruable here due solely because demand exceeds supply\u2014meanwhile ignoring costs involved including material expense but only considering time spent labor intensive work itself!

Since we need to calculate based on running for three months instead of a full year, divide our results by multiplying them all together accordingly, calculating as follows ((60*24*7)*(3/12))-$((45*24*7)*(3/12)).
