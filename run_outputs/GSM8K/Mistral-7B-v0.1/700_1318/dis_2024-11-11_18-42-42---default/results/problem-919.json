Well this question asks us about the revenue generated from sales not just our costs related to them so we need first calculate these numbers as shown above before determining what all funds might possibly remain available over time but I am still getting confused because my teacher wants me write like it sounds or something... But anyways let\u2019s break down the problem using only information provided.. We know; Cost/Price Of One Piece(c)=$.5 Sell Price Per Each Piece (p)=$0.8 Number Sold By Total Students Avg.(t)=10 Fundraiser Amount Raised=(p\u2212c)*total_stud*avgy sold $(x)=?(r)=\\begin{aligned} \\text { Revenus }&= p\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{y}}{\\mathrm{w}}\\right)\\cdot w \\\\ &= 0.8 (\\frac{30}{1})\\cdot 30=\\color{",
        " if we sell those ones it\u2019d still earn us (5)(($0.8-$0.5)/($0.8)=(5)(0.3/0.8). This simplifies down as follows; ($0.5*x=$1.5), solving this equation you would get approximately or rounded up ((1.5/$0.5)-(0.5))= ($3\u2013$0.5)= $(2.5). Since every kid earned only about $2.5 all together they couldn\u2019t buy any candies which doesn\u2019t make sense because why wouldn\u2019t try since nobody spent everything right away.. To figure out what happened here let me rethink my math! I realized when i first solved these equations backward like this instead start off using just numbers into variables such n%=(c\u00d7a_i),(m\u2212\u2211ni+b\u2215c)_+(o\u00f7w). First convert % signes \u2192 decimals\u2026 Secondly find o dividing c\u22c5a_(ci)= m b/(c)+[(\u03bc\u2212sumn\u2208{A_k}{}bi)]^(1\u2044q)). Next take q values times sum bi \u00d7 ci j \u2212lf^\u03b1\u2192\u222b[D](C\u2032 )dz . Finally compute \u03b1\u03a3mij\u0394ij D\u00b7z . With new formula result becomes very close yet slightly different than expected \u2014 almost exactly enough amount required but not quite matching perfectly due perhaps human error during calculation steps along way thus far :( Oh wait \u2026 ! That means either wrong value entered somewhere above , mistake happening within algorithm itself possibly incorrect operation applied among various subsections involved thereby causing slight variance amongst individual results obtained through repeated runs upon execution ; probably simple arithmetic mistake made accidentally once before without realizing immediately afterwards despite working carefully over time otherwise nothing particularly concerning considering situation described earlier ~~ :P Alright okay thanks alot man yep sure see ya later same page hahaha ..

        " piece. This means they make profits worth (0.8 - 0.5) per piece or 0.3/piece. Since every child sells roughly about ten popsicles; therefore the three children made approximately ((3*10)*(0.8-$0.5))=$9 net gain during sales season. Each kid raised ($9/$30)=$0.3 as compared to purchasing price meaning if we add this amount together since all kids brought similar amounts it would result into($0.3*$30=)$9 raising so far . Therefore ,the class altogether collected around these values thus making my calculation correct but wrongly wording saying 'however', I apologize! That makes sense thanks!",
        " = 240 dollars if all sold successfully as expected. To find out how much money raised from profiting over costs; subtract what it spent ($15) off against its earnings (($240-$15)*). That leads us back totals about 225(dollars)). Therefore, we can conclude this problem asks exactly...how much revenue minus initial expense equals net income or gross margin, which you could also calculate directly using your own formula! I don\u2019t see another way around than doing so myself though:) It would mean dividing both sides by three because every person brings forth only half amount compared too when counting together therefore resulting into these answers here..
