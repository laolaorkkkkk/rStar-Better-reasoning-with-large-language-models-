This calculation equated as follows:  \ud835\udc65= _______ . From calculations we know that: x represents amount of Pencils Anthony keeps; thus solving this equation leads us to determine exactly quantity saved by Anthony without any ambiguity or errors due our precision process followed throughout solution development phase..
