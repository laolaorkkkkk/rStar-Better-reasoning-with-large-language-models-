Subtracting 2 from the total number of hours during which Bruce was employed provides us the duration of employment on Thursday. Hence subtract 2 years from 10 years resulting into getting this value. Perform subtraction operation accordingly . Thus add up the results obtained as follows : Total Time Spent Working Per Week or Month Calculated via adding together , Employees Tenure Duration Work Hours Accumulated across These Days Add the values we calculated above i.e., ten(hours) + fifteen plus fourteen equals thirtyone therefore Bruce spends over twenty one eightieth periods while engaged daily pursuing occupation within set period timespan comprising trio distinct weekdays.
