        " this question if you want! Let me know when u wanna see it.<|end_of_document|>Assistant:```plaintextTo find out how much each ear of corn should cost, let\u2019s first calculate how much money Bennet made from selling the eggplants.He sold 20 eggplants at $3 each, so:Eggplants sales revenue = Number of eggs plants \u00d7 Price per eggplant= 20 \u00d7 $3=$60So next, subtract the amount earned from eggplants from the desired total earnings:Remaining Earnings needed ($) = Desired Total Earning($) \u2212 Revenue From Eggplants$135\u2212$60=$75This means that Bennet needs to make another $75 through the sale of the corn.Since he has 25 ears of corn, divide the remaining necessary income by the quantity of corn:Price Per Corn (= Remaining Earnings / Quantity)= $75/25 ears=$(75\u00f725)$=$3Thus, Bennet would need to charge $3 for every ear of corn to meet his goal of making $135 in total.`The answer is: 3.```",

To find out what price per piece for this specific kind (corn) needs to equal ...$135 but only knowing about one other item..

Total amount remaining when subtracting earned funds from desired sum becomes ....(the unknown value here). You could also simply divide $(desired totals minus already gained through another type)/amount still needed . .. What comes next is simple : Divide your remainder into however large / small groups fit necessary/possible , or multiply them together until their product meets required demand !!!

        " $135, he needs this amount over eggs alone so subtracting their cost from it would lead us closer: $135 \u2212 ($3 \u00d7 20) which results into $135 - $60 (which equals **$75**). This value represents what remains if all those eggs sold already brought him enough money!
