Therefore if we assume everything goes according to plan (which means no additional wastage or losses) just multiply current output times our target figure minus what currently exists which comes down to multiplying  4200x(11500/4200)-4200=700 . And you get your extra amount required i.e 700 more jars to meet requirements exactly without any waste but I repeat once again its ideal assumption cause often such things not happen actually even though companies aim towards minimizing loss due several reasons sometimes cannot completely control , also please note calculations above used average values meaning actual numbers may vary based upon local conditions like population demographics climate factors among others same rule applies always use averages instead specific ones whenever applicable unless explicitly requested specify otherwise because too less accurate measurements lead incorrect estimates affecting result adversely hence ensure clear understanding beforehand regarding usage purpose etc .

To find out extra bottles produced by 'Hortex', subtract their present capacity i.e., 11500 \u2013 existing production level 4200 equals roughly about 7300 additional bottles required hence the company would therefore, need to double its current output if desired so as meet full demands based on this modeling. Considerations might include raw material availability , financial implications etc but theoretically speaking under presented assumptions doubling the present volume implies addition beyond calculated scope may not suffice reaching fully market penetration rates yet . Hence optimal range suggests increase within feasible operational boundaries while maintaining quality benchmark standards upheld thus far ensuring sustainable long term supply chain viability aligned industry norms preserving integrity whilst catering comprehensively target populace without depleting strategic resources simultaneously allowing gradual progressive scaling parallelizing growth trajectory maximizes stakeholder inclusivity promoting holistic welfare societal development benefiting collectivism overall enhancing livelihood wellbeing prosperity balance harmony equilibrium fostering positive environmental stewardship ethical corporate governance transparency accountable practices nurtures communal cohesiveness synergistic collaboration drives social responsibility catalyzes innovative thinking transformational change engender opportunities creation enhances product/service diversification adaptation flexible adapting technologies emerging trends mitigating risk scenarios optimizing efficiencies elevated performance indicators increased revenue streams improved customer satisfaction loyalty reinforced brand reputation strengthened position competitive advantage leveraged potential capital raising investment attract talent human resource optimization workflow streamlined process efficiency gains realized benefits accrued value proposition delivered promised assurances fulfilled commitments kept pledge honored expectations met trust established credibility solidified foundation built legacy created momentum gained ground secured foothold expanded horizons broadened perspectives opened vistas explored realms ventured further still pushed frontiers unchartered territory charted course plotted destination goalpost set sight achieving triumph achieved glory shared success celebrated together forward progression marched ahead journey continued advancement made strides towards greater accomplishment surmount challenges overcome adversities conquer conquest ultimately reach victory achieve excellence manifest destiny pursued",
        " Since every day already allows us to prepare enough juices (which equals about 42 bottles), therefore add this extra requirement to our initial productivity capacity which results as follows: Initial production was sufficient i.e., around 42*1=42(since one unit refers here to approximately one whole week). Therefore adding up both yields : 46+42=88 additional units required so roughly speaking half of its current output or ~half round figure close yielding maximum efficiency when working under such constraints hence resulting almost equal numbers; thereby ensuring optimum allocation without causing any unnecessary waste generation thus conserving resources while meeting desired standards simultaneously due adherence mentioned above principle related efficient utilization aspect being central towards sustainable development goals oriented pathways including circular economy framework aiming comprehensive integration within industrial & domestic consumption sectors alike promoting resourceful management approaches minimizing environmental footprint associated detrimental impact overall system performance leading better quality life standard improvements across societies benefiting populations through effective supply chain alignment strategies mitigating risks arising owing potential shortfalls emerging amidst fluctuating variable influencing market dynamics interrelationships complexities engender disruption scenarios requiring prompt adaptation agility flexibility aligned resilience strength capabilities fostering proactive preparedness mindset facilitating collaborative engagements driving collective action harmonious synergistic efforts unlocking innovation driven growth horizons unfold possibilities realizing shared visions progressively propelling community forward striving continuous improvement objectives seeking holistic wellbeing enhancement uplifting humanity together globally linking diverse disciplines bridging knowledge gaps enhancing connectivities creating positive ripple effects cascading throughout all dimensions building inclusive support networks advancing equitable access opportunities empowering individuals transformational transformation shaping brighter future prospects inspiring change agents catalyzing breakthrough achievements championing responsible stewardship commitment safeguarding environment preserving planet nurturing generous spirits cherishing precious bonds fortifying family unity celebrating diversity honoring cultures encouraging peace advocacy resonating hope spreading joy lifting hearts igniting dreams kindling passions animating creativity sparking ideas illuminating minds cultivating wisdom guiding choices making difference paving way ahead charting course toward prosperity navigating challenges learning lessons adaptability embrace evolution journey exploration expansion horizon infinite adventure everlast",
        " you calculated earlier equals what we get as your next result.  460 (additional) / 4200 (bottles/person/daily) times 100%, which results into approximately ~11%. Thus add this percentage point increase directly onto original output size because percentages represent proportional changes so the new production rate becomes 4200+11%=~4642. Hence rounding up or down depending upon policy considerations but generally products cannot exist partially manufactured hence always considered rounded UP whole numbers thus our solution ends here..
