        " what it means when we say 'half as many robots'. Half of any quantity implies multiplying it by .5 (or dividing by 2).

        " you halve this figure (which means divide it into twain parts), your result would reveal exactly how many fewer footballs than helmets. That makes our next statement identify twice as many objects being found when calculating against both other figures identified earlier\u2014helmets or footballs respectively. As mentioned above about figuring out what amount comes before cutting down anything else already seen because everything here appears based around dividing existing quantities equally among themself but none equaling zero! Which implies finding one factor behind their multiplication/division ratio could tell us something meaningful concerning sizes differences within these categories since all values matter individually even though ratios provide useful comparisons across groups due numerical similarity amongst components present inside said groupings while also allowing calculation ease through simply plugging known variables together like so : Number(football)/NumberHelmet=Two*(Football/(Helmet+Helmet))=(TotalObjects-(ObjectGolfes+(ObjectHelmets)+(ObjectRobotics)))*RatioBetweenAllItemsInvolved=-[EquationFormulaWhereValuesSubstitutedWithIdenticalVariableNamesForSimplification] ",
        " in equal proportion (half as many) this means Robots=Helmet/2 i.e., Half_Robot=Helmet value / 2 . We need only find out Total Number which consists all three categories but can see it directly using Proportions; Helmet->Total_Number , Football\u2192total_number & thus Mathematically calculating ; Using Equation :Football = twice(Helmet), so lets assume amount footballer represent Factorially ..So when considering same ratio its like having double or four times any one item represents another category.. This equation becomes helpful further since our known data point would correspond either equally distributed among those categories according mentioned pattern OR even multiply them following respective rules described above... But due similarity nature within these ratios made easier calculation possible without dividing anything else nor multiplying anymore!
