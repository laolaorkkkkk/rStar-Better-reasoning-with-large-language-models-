        " his new speed becomes 150 x 2.5 = 375 WPM (words per minute). To find out how fast he can speak one full text consisting of 10 pages or 10 x 450= 4500 words, we need to divide this amount into what he can say within seconds since minutes might not suffice due to high speeds involved. We convert John\u2019s reading rate from words/minute to sec^-1; 375 / 60 (= approx 6.25) means Jhon reads roughly 6.25 words per second. Thus, to determine how long it takes him to read all these texts worthfully translated as T_sec equals Total Word Count divided by Reading Speed which computes approximately equal to ~693.33 sec when you calculate  4500/(~6.25), rounding off your result provides us about 107 min rounded downwards approximatively close.

        " WPM. Each page contains 450 words, so 10 pages contain 450 * 10 = 4500 words. At his increased speed of 375 WPM, it would take him 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes to speak all ten pages. This conversion assumes one minute equals sixty seconds as standard time measurement convention. Therefore, converted into hours this totals approximately 0.2 hours (for instance) or roughly about twenty sixteen point seven three thirty eight seventy fourth thousandths of an hour using decimal representation methodology.

Compute the time required using initial information provided around numbers involved within the question text about word count. Each booklet contains four hundred fifty words so the complete compendium encapsulates six thousand three hundred words [ calculated via multiplying 450 (words/page ) X 2 (pages)] .. Divide overall volume captured across all manuscripts(six thousand three hundred words) into individual speeds delivered (three seven sixty-five words) , revealing approximately ninety seconds needed or .9 minutes (.9 expressed differently). Thus taking ten manuals together yields nearly one minute point forty (one decimal place value rounded downwards ).
