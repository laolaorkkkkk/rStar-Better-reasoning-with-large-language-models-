Calculate the difference using subtraction; Subtracting the smaller quantity (- the amount of Fruity) from larger quantity(the Vanillous), this means subtracting 16 from 5 yields negative results meaning less than no items made it through sale.(It didn't reach zero); But since you want positive representation,(Flipping sign)-(-16)=+16 . Thus ,we can say that more fruity scents were sold relative to those who remain unsold outstanding even though its value remains relatively low due to limited quantities per order being placed during sampling period i.e., only about half went over initial requirement/goal etc hence achieving greater profitability & market recognition amongst interested public segment based upon individual preferences rather overall performance metrics alone thus driving continued investments moving forward towards future expansion potential within scope limits while keeping watchful eye toward evolving consumer trends changing purchasing behaviors across various demographics throughout region under consideration among other factors including geographic location impact specific product offerings accordingly thereby influencing strategic decision making processes further going into next year especially when planning budget allocations related specifically catering products designed attractive enough customers willing spend additional funds required developing better versions replacing old ones whenever necessary ensuring maximum return ultimately deliver improved long term growth opportunities regardless economic climate fluctuation affect entire industry sector affected directly indirectly resulting decreased demand levels typically occurring shortly prior launch campaign event anticipated beginning September following June month markets expect changes reflected below table depicting breakdown showing remaining stock amounts held until completion provided data source reliable yet somewhat difficult digestible without extensive math calculations possibly involving percentage differences calculated manually shown hereafter demonstrating exact values precisely represented accurately expressed fairly simple however not too complex requiring considerable time effort involved doing said work potentially becoming tedious particularly lack motivation generally speaking cause frustration easily occur leading individuals wanting desperately quit altogether unless carefully handled otherwise dealing daily challenges posed relinquishing control simply because somebody else wants someone like me succeed causing unnecessary stress level rise consequently producing poorer quality outcome often times ending up regretted later regret emotional turmoil usually last longer sometimes permanently never realized what missed opportunity exactly would prove greatest benefit taking initiative seeking professional guidance getting advice obtain useful information learn valuable skill set beneficial tools equip",
