        " box (weight) equals the total weight without including any individual weights as every single unit contributes equally here. Total weight would thus equal  25*8=<<25*8=200>>200 ounces since this includes both crayons and their respective containers or packaging material too. Convert this figure using provided data points about units conversion mentioned above; one Pounds being equivalent of fourteen Ounces hence divide calculated sum 200 / 16 which yields result approximately around 12.5 pounds roughly. ",
        " ounces. Convert this value to pounds using conversion rate mentioned (i.e., divide it by amount of oz in one lb) so 200/16 = 12.5 lb . Add both values calculated above i.e.; 25(boxes)+the result obtained while converting weights earlier=total items including empty boxes considered here which comes out as 37.5 kg converted back again gives us approximately about [assistant] : Weight ",
        " pound. 200 ounces divided by 16 equals 12.5 pounds for just the crayons. Because there\u2019s one additional empty container equaling (the remaining) another 8 ounces or half a pound being used as well. Subtract this volume from above result; leaving you with a new value which equates roughly to around 12.25 pounds if combined together! However it may vary slightly depending upon roundoff errors made during calculation process steps along way.. "
