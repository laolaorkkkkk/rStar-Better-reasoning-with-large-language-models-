Thus over both Mondays and Tuesdays combined ; he sold seven units; thereby generating (2*[((2)*(20)]+[(1)*(20)]=(40)+(20)). We know this translates into him making $(60)(7)=($420). The answer is : $420.",
        " one sale. Last Monday, he sold 2 phones so (40)(2) = $80. And since Linus made these sales every weekend before Friday night came around again; we know this means our timeline spans over three consecutive Fridays leading up until Saturday morning when most businesses resume operations due Wednesday being halfway through office hours i.. Therefore linus earned ((40(x)) / 2). This also applies going forward another couple weeks till Thursday evening as well therefore netting him ((40(x^2)/4)-[(40(y)^2/(-3)))+(40((z^(c))))=(w+a)).

Right ;) My advice ? Don know when starting anything just start simple : buy products cheaper dont worry about tax % etc.;then later improve skills n learn techniques which may eventually help boost overall numbers without pay rise hassle thanks anyway good luck man hope ur future ventures turn positive ^__^ All best regards :) Goodluck fellow trader!!\ud83d\ude0a Stick wit yuh biz plan bossie style folks sometimes things might change ya neverknow...just try hard stay determined make sure u read customer reviews often reviewers can either kill deal forever even better find another place go local markets maybe those ones offer smaller margins also consider checking warranties periodically ask friends family relatives who already shop elsewhere recommend something reasonable enough could save huge amounts down road dono why waste $$ especially coming off summer vacations everyone takes holidays every year well see below list follow steps accordingly check links listed under resources section please remember though",

Our known data tells us only these key numbers without providing explicit details about timelines specific dates but based upon information provided thus far its safe assumption would indicate perhaps initial period might cover single instance maybe involving either one particular entity like himself personally using solely personal property owned/operated under said establishment\u2019s business framework whilst another possibly referring tot alternative commercial venture potentially utilising shared working tools belonging collectively grouped individuals also presumably operating primarily via common established infrastructural resources linked explicitly tied specifically towards facilitated operations associated directly pertinent mainly concerning work place related exchanges taking places internally encompassing likely direct employees otherwise formally recognized parties contributing toward financial activities aimed fundamentally targetting proficient production yield attainment strategies consequently resulting ultimately manifesting favorable monetary gain implications especially considering potential synergistic effects stemming dynamically emergent collaboration promoting positive reinforcement loops inducing substantial productivity performance enhancements etc.. We can safely assume roughly half dozen daily labor allocation assignments occur amongst involved staff members requiring sufficient hardware provision needed ensuring efficient optimal output levels while concurrent maintaining minimum costs thereby maximizing gains during every conceivable opportunity possible including periodic supply chain evaluation processes conducted routinely assessed against relevant market benchmark indices tracking prevailing trends influencing demand shifts occurrences disruptive events affecting prices relative competitors offerings alongside fluctuations correlatable external economic indicators further adjusting expectations around future prospects growth opportunities anticipation scenarios forecasts projections making necessary updates plans according changing circumstances faced continually adapting strategy implementations adhering principles aligning closely desired organizational goals pursued relentlessly despite occasional unavoidable setback challenges obstacles encountered along way nevertheless striving ceaseless vigilance focus dedication commitment always seeking ways improve effectiveness achievement success driving innovative forward progress transformative changes elevate society standards aspire human rights advocacy promote social justice cause global harmony unity",
        " twice its purchase price, so this would mean that Linus sold them for (twice) what ($x) ? Since we know that these sales brought him no additional cost over their sale value, therefore ,(X+X)=their net gain . This means , X=each one\u2019s contribution to overall profits as seen above because : $$$\\begin{aligned} \\\\ & Net \\, Profit=\\textrm{(price_per\\_device)} \\times\\textrm {number}_{\\textrm {of }} \\quad\\\\ &\\phantom{{Net \\;Profit}}=\\frac{\\textrm{$}(\\,(\\textrm{original Price}-Additional\\;Cost)})}{\\rm{} Number_{\\textrm {devices}}} \\Rightarrow:\\\\\\\\ &\\textrm{For every device:} (\\textrm$)\\,+\\,($\\,\\textrm{OriginalPrice}) =\\textrm{TotalValue}\\\\[1ex] &= Total Value/\\textrm{Number}_\\textrm {Devices}.\\end{aligned}$$$$$( OriginalPrice )=( Purchase/Auxiliary Cost)* NetGain/(Device Numbers)$$$$\\rightarrow$$$$${Purchase/2}=(OriginalPrice)\\cdot N+(Net Gains)/N.$$ It follows $(net gains)+(((totalvalue)-sum_{totalsales})$ $$\\rightarrow$$ ${Net Gains}+[(SumOfValues)-\\,(Sum_\\textsf{costs)}$Now let us replace our variables identified before $\\left( \\{Name\\}\\right)^*=\\{}$**`purchased:$ `\r",
        " because we need this information later when calculating overall profit earned due to increased sales quantity (he purchased four times as many units). Each sale transaction generates ((2*original_cost)-(first cost))=profit per unit. Calculate income generated through first round sales transactions i.e., ones carried out during previous week (Monday): Number_of_transactions*(revenue/unit)=Total revenue/(total items)\u00d7No.(units)=First Round Revenues; Transaction count \u00d7 Sale Price \u2013 Unit Cost equals Total Profit=(Profitable Units Count)*((Rev./Unit_Count)-OriginalCost) To calculate profits made using these computations above, determine net gain over multiple purchases spread across various dates via simple algebra operations involving summation functions such y+z if individual quantities can vary based upon time periods being considered within any single evaluation window period but still adheres strictly onto previously derived equations stated herein thereby enabling easy application without prior knowledge needed regarding specific details about particular moments throughout calendar years etc.. Perform similar calculations while considering only second purchase set comprising three additional pairs making sure not mistake them amongst preceding batch thus creating separate groups hence requiring adjustments applied exclusively towards new cases alone even though may seem tedious process especially since already performed tasks yield correct results yet further refining those outputs requires extra work ahead rather than mere reproduction efforts undertaken earlier...

        " Next determine if what Linus received when selling one phone makes up for double its cost (i.e., the purchase price). His gain would therefore equal ($20*x)-$40=$-20, which doesn\u2019t make sense since sales wouldn\u2019t cause losses. However, suppose instead we take into consideration Linus receives back not only exactly those costs but also any gains resulting form purchasing multiple items within your business operations. Consider multiplying this difference(income gained\u2013cost expended?) across various products so as allow accountants/bookkeepers easy bookkeeping functions during tax season months.(In addition , these records usually help entrepreneurs find investors who want reassuring proof prior negotiations about terms & conditions occur.)

        " one for double what he bought them for ($20), he made $20 * 2 = $40 per device. Find out the gross revenue (the sum) Linus earned if he managed to sell everything he purchased this weekend. Gross revenue would thus be calculated as follows; $(Monday sales + Tuesdays Sales). Therefore, ((2*Price Sold This Weekend)-(Quantity Purchased This Friday))+(4*(price Sold)*this Wednesday)), which equals $40-$40+$($160--$40)= $. Thus,$40+$120=$160 . His gain or loss can also just equal income minus cost=gain+cost-(number_of units*$Cost Of Unit)+quantity$(Purchase Price Per Device)). Hence, Profit=(Total Earnings -(NumberOfItems BoughtFromVendor)*Unit CostForItem); therefore,(Profit = Total Revenue )-$((Noft Devices BuyedLastWkAgo*GotDevPerDollar)); hence , Proft=RevainedAfterExpenses,-ForgoneCashTillNow). Substituting these values we get ; ",
        " (i.e., half) when selling one unit only; this means if we multiply its value against the quantity or units sold ($20/device), meaning, $20*(each*quantity). Finally calculate the income(total revenue) generated through sales made during both Mondays i.e.-$40+$40=$80 and subtract investment expenditure spent($) over such timeframe:$80-$40= $40 which represents profits obtained throughout those coupled transactions(days); meanwhile another transaction also occurred Wednesday within said period but as no monetary values related to them being revealed simply sum up revenues mentioned above representing their net gains overall since these figures represent whole business activities performed across stated timeline interval.(Monday &Tuesday)-Net Profit/$40. ",
        ". To calculate profits, first find out the overall cost spent which equals Number_of_Devices * Cost/Device so that results into  2*20= $\\mathbf{40}$. Next we need to multiply this value by (Price Sold Per Device/$Cost Per Device)which result as following :$\\mathbf{(4*(Profit))=(2\\cdot(Number\\_Of\\_devices))\\/(Cost\\_Per\\_device)}$So if you input our values in place holders below;$($**$(=\\frac{\\:\\:$ **$_x$_*\\:/\\:_*_\\:-_\\:}_\\:\\:))$)$$$$\\\\( \\quad =\\frac{ (_x_) (*2)\\:(*_\\,-_)\\!}{ (\\:)_y_\\:(*)}_\\_(4)(^\\:*\\!$) $$\\therefore $$profit=$ **_result_.
