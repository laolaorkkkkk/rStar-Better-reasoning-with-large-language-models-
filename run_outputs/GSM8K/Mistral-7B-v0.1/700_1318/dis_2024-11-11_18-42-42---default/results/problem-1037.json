I simplify my expression using parentheses ($):=(($$(1*\\)$)($\\{2\\}\\))\\$. Similarly, the cost for taking away three loaves costs me ((1\u00d7{$})+( {$})^3)=((1*$)^3+ ({}^3)). Since amusement needs to pay twice as little for Mowza than for Perasso \u2014 or rather exactly doubled [(one dollar \u00d7 $\\{}\\$)], because multiplying amounts always produces results greater when dealing with positive numbers. To determine which option leaves her most amount, subtract your result minus the same negative value again plus twenty percent; this means finding differences without rearrangement.
