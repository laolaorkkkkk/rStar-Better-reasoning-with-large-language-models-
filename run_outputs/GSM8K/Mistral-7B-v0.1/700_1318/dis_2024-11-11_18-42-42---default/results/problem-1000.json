Adding this together we see he uses fifteen sixteenths (.75) of every working eight hours plus one third,. Thus leaving just twelve nineteenths (.6923). Subtracting this value from our starting amount leaves us eighteen minus eleven (one sixthth less) equals seventeen fifthhs, thus around three point two nine seconds leftover but since Dr Doctors clock measures whole numbers not fractional parts you get rounded down to zero because physicians cannot round into non integral values when recording their schedule especially within short periods such as single sessions.(He can only record either full moments once recorded , ie. always counting integer quantities.) Hence doctor jones gets no spare time remaining! But let me clarify something : While I understand what your question implies about hospital work cycles usually being counted using decimals/fractions rather than integers perhaps due mainly simply considering shorter lengths involved versus those found over extended durations ), however generally speaking medical practitioners indeed keep track via numerical counts representing complete measureable increments(which include both discrete unit amounts alongwith partial units defined through divisibility allowing them quantify exact measurements even including portions smaller hence why most often described timings reflect precision upto minimum hundredth places despite actually having very fine granularity allowed among other factors ; therefore although technically correct under specified circumstances mentioned above could potentially apply yet commonly employed routine practices dictate preferring traditional system employment ). Therefore regardless my previous statement concerning precise estimation methodologies possibly applicable though strictly theoretical construct might still hold merit depending upon desired level preciseness sought thereby necessitating careful consideration prior determining appropriate approach whether opting solely binary based calculations vs hybrid combining analog tactics intermediary steps ensuring accuracy while maintainng efficiency simultaneously during complex scenarios encounterd frequently throughout healthcare fields worldwide ..
