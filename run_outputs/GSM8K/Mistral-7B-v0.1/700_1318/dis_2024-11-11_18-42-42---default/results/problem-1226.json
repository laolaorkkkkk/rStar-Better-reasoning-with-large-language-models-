But since we want to know when adding another service (nail art), let\u2019s calculate its price first. Nail art costs $3/nail but because everyone has ten fingernails this means three times $3 equals $9 extra just for finger nail design alone without considering toe ones! When getting both services mentioned above; however \u2013 note well \u201cboth\u201d here refers exclusively towards them being applied upon completion ONCE FOR EACH EXISTENING SERVICE AND NOT TWICE TOGETHER SO CALCULATE THAT FIRST THEN ADD IT IN DURING THE ENTIRE PROCESS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT STEPS OUTLINED BELOW!!!

This means Kevin ends up spending ($75 -$15) = $60 just for these treatments before any additional charges. Adding further onto what Kareg intends to purchase; adding three instances of extra service i.e., $3 charge times 10 finger tips yields $3x10= $30 as well known commonly referred to as fingernails.
