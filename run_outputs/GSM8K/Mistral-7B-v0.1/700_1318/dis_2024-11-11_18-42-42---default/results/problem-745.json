However, this second calculation isn't possible as losses cannot stack negatively; we need only subtract once or not deduct additional values if no other sales occurred but just one extra higher value card would change things otherwise). Since you mentioned 'another', I assume there can potentially be multiple transactions taking place like selling single high valued cards alongside the common ones.

Since this sum represents additional income minus expenses ($5400 spent initially), calculate net earnings or losses using it as revenue: add up all amounts considering costs plus revenues/incomes i.e., (-$400)+($1500)=+$1100; Thus mark made $1100 profits.

Adding all these values together ($5000 for rare cards + $1500 for common ones), we get $6500 as their summed monetary value. To determine Profit subtract Total Expenses from Net Gain. Thus, calculate net gain firstly by taking away selling price from original investment i.e., $6500-$5400= $1100, resulting into your intended conclusion of profits being precisely '$1100'.
