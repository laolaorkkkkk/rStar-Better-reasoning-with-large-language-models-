Let's represent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) as part of our equation when multiplied or divided by numbers less than half to account for successive reductions until reaching equality.\\n\\nWe know that reducing something means making it smaller, which mathematically corresponds to multiplication if referring to values greater than zero but represents division when dealing directly with percentages.
