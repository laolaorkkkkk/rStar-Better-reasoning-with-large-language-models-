Over these four days we can calculate attendance minus one other period because our subject attended another six sessions i.e., [5-(number)]= [-1] Therefore over those same three times john spent only eighty mins less than usual so finally add all up ,[x\u2212\u2153\u00b72\u00d76]= \u2212[-1].

Finally convert everything back into houres using known facts about our standard measuring units called 'hours'. An hour consists roughly thirty six thousand seconds whereas forty eight thousandths represent fractional portions based off base ten system hence why decimal points follow suit when describing rates such fractions etc..

Add up regular minute schedule plus supplemental lessons , you\u2019ll find out it equals   1200+400=1600 minutes or about four eight hour blocks..Now because saturday and sundays require another portion(one twelfth part), meaning one fourth block equivalent if calculated using twentyfour hours measure. That accounts around six hours off our initial forty hour sum. Subtracting here brings down approximately thirty three and half hours spent on formal study across all seven days; Friday through Tuesday being dedicated fulltime academics while maintaining spare moments during Thurdsday morning until Wednessday noon.(since john needs double amounts those nightclasses taken away).. Total calculation comes upto roughly **Twenty One Hours Eighty Four Minutes** worth considering both leisure activity outside academic life itself alongside necessary rest along its tenets without excessive indulgence causing undesirable fatigue leading toward exhaustion... It may seem like quite little when compared against average standards expected among students especially coming back home later tonight following such extended preparation efforts yet remember even small steps lead great distances over years cumulatively shaping wellformed minds capable challenging themselves repeatedly within context setting boundaries appropriate respect owning their space towards personal development ensuring growth sustained far beyond mere transitional phases ultimately transitioning fully into productivity reflecting upon accomplishments rather than failures alone!

Therefore let\u2019s say those kids need just forty percent less than what adult professionals require thus twenty six point eight hour full timers rather! However since we already know john takes extracurricular activities outside these standard educational schedules hence only part through them makes him eligible here according too specified conditions; therefore adding back both initial calculations subtract any potential restorative downtime caused within evenings whilst maintaining strict adherence against unrealistic scenarios involving excessiveness resulting largely because our primary concern regards accurate estimation based solely upon provided parameters without delving into hypothetical extremes further exacerbated thereby potentially impacting conclusions reached regarding overall efficiency levels associated specifically relative particularly compared directly versus actual values obtained otherwise absent special consideration placed aside factual circumstances specific individual unique attributes influencing personal performance capacities linked primarily chief amongst factors determining exact figures representative accurately representing distinct case scenario subject matter involved requiring comprehensive understanding nuances related encompass broader complex context underlying issue faced challenging achieve satisfactory resolution applicable universally across diverse environments encountered practically real world situations arising regularly daily life experiences commonly occurrences happen unexpected events unfold routinely seemingly ordinary tasks suddenly become daunting hurdles surpass usual expectations confront individuals forced navigate pathways not previously contemplated possibly never imagined prior encountering similar obstacles might inspire innovation newfound passion pursue goals formerly thought inconceivable overcome insurmountable difficulties transform limitations perceived constraints becoming stepping stones achieving greater heights everlasting legacy leaving indelible mark shaping future generations inspired beyond measure accomplishments achieved standing testament triumph amidst adversity embody true spirit conquering impossible feats setting benchmark standards reaching pinnacle glory celebrated wholeheartedly forevermore always remembered revered held dear esteemed respect accorded universal acclaim deserving honor dignified distinction worthy recognition exemplifying excellence quintessential role models embodiment human virtues characteristics traits behaviors actions choices decisions",

We need only count part-time commitments outside regular instructional activities like sports programs etc.; if one such activity lasting forty minutes requires participation thrice within any single seven-day calendar interval while another necessitates involvement once biweekly yet still encompasses fourty-five minute durations all cumulatively accounting separately upon themselves--then what quantity represents merely educational pursuits during comparable temporal constructs without including supplementary scholastic endeavors beyond ordinary mandatory education stints over consecutive weeks under examination?.

Therefore I suspect something might've gone wrong along our calculation journey! Perhaps perhaps though consider instead : if john actually doesn't attend every single period due maybe sickness etc , could things change significantly ?
