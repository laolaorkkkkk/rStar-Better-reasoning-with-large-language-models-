We see these symbols represent division operators here because percentages can usually refer only totals whereas absolute magnitudes cannot readily change depending upon context even when different units apply making comparison meaningless otherwise\u2026 Therefore let us convert everything first using fractional forms(so nothing else remains constant either): Let E stand fro Extreme Sudokus while N stands Fro Normal ones ; F represents Time periods per unit measure used ie Hours/Minutes , L denotes Amount consumers consume Water during those intervals And D indicates Total Bottled Drinking available until consumption happens completely : Q marks Equality operator & R means Modulus operation applied onto results calculated earlier Hence calculating values according provided rules yield resultant formula looks like This however simplifies quite nicely down since terms become negligible except last variable alone namely X .
