        " Each wooden table costs $20 as stated. Calculate the cost for all wood tables by multiplying quantity (4) times unit cost ($20). Hence, cost equals Quantity($x$) \u00d7 Unit Price($y$), so we put this into the equation form; Cost=Quantity\u00d7UnitPrice=>$C_t=\\binom{n}{k}\\cdot p^i\\cdot q^{j}$, putting actual values =>$\\begin{array}{| c |} \\\\ \\hline C_t=(4)(20)=\\binom{4}{4}(20)^1(1)^{4-1}\\\\   &=    &\\\\&&& =80&\\end{array}$ This means it costs \\$80 to buy all four wooden tables together. It also says John made another product too which was 'roof frame'. Find its value based off information provided. Number of Roof Frames: 2 Price Per Frame:$10$. Like before calculate Total Value:=RoofFrames\u00d7PricePerFrame===TotalCost OfAllProductsNow simply add these totals up.: $(80)+[(2)\\times(10)]==>(80+20)=$$100$, hence $\\boxed{\\text{Ali Has To Pay }Jackson}{\\color{orange} {10}}$. Please provide rationale behind your calculations. Let me explain my solution process : Firstly I identified three components within the question i.e., type of products/items created , their quantities produced along with prices tagged upon them .

        " wooden table costs him $20. Calculate the cost of all wooden tables using multiplication (i.e., multiply quantity times unit pricing).

Relevant factors include only specific measurable attributes directly tied to quantifiable production units\u2014namely, item counts multiplied by unit price ($). Irrelevant aspects involve nonquantitative qualities like individual material properties not reflected uniformly across items or subjective assessments related to workmanship skill since these lack consistent pricing structure integration within our problem constraints.
