Since we know half of that sum was equal to Adam\u2019s mother contribution ($6), it means his father also gave him three times the former (since \u201ctwice\u201d usually doubles something). This results in $6 x 2 = $12 coming from his fathers side. Adding up contributions made by all family members would make us having used just enough without touching Adam's personal funds; hence, no portion comes directly out from Adam's pocket aside his initial investment \u2013 so nothing else needs subtracting off.

Thus the remainder came out of Savings account meaning; if we assume no other sources like loans etc..the remaining was taken straight from personal saving ,in terms such case it is said Adrian took/contributed backward towards SAVING . To calculate the exact percentage value one can express taking say 'x%' thusly : ((100-(percentage contribution))/(sum totaled) )*.((amount paid)/total expected)*100%(a fractional expression representing % change using average rates formula)..so simply take overall input values divided by desired output amounts multiplied by initial starting figure times 100 therefore:$12/$30=.4\u00d7100%=40%.

This means from Adam\u2019s own funds, only (amount already saved) \u2013 ($30+(mother contribution)+(father contribution)) would remain untouched or yet unsaved when it came time for purchasing his pants.

As Adam needed only $30 but already received $18 from parental contribution; so let us subtract these contributions i.e., 30-$18=$12 was made up out of Adam\u2019s savings. Hence the required amount (i.e., the money Adam used) amounts to $12 . This would make Adam having enough saving balance remaining untouched till date without affecting anything else since all expenses were covered due to generosity shown by his close ones regarding their gifts/donations(this applies whenever someone gets financial assistance like tips or donation).

Hence, \u201cfinal answer\u201d here would not refer to any numerical value but rather represent justifying reasoning leading up to such conclusion \u2013 hence making its extraction impossible.
