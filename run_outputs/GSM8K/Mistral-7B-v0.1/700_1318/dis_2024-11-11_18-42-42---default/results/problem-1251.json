        " 2 = 10 minutes. Similarly, since it took him equally longer (double) time getting into fourth and fifth corners compared to seconds corner , so these both taken respectively :  5* 2=<<5*2=10>> 10 Minutes . But sixth part was quicker than those parts taking only half the amount spent earlier i.e.,     1/2*(first+second)=    ((half)+(half))of previous effort     therefore times invested becomes       [{(1/2)*((previousone)})+(another half)]=(sum ) of previously spends efforts or simply said          [(timeinvestedtogetintofifthside)/(twicetheinitial)+timesspentonpreviousthreesides]/(timesinvestdedontothethreestages).               Thus we can say;                        Time spendtounithreefouris equal to:[(Timeinvestedtotogetintothefirstsidexthree)+TotalTimesInvestedtorobusthethirdstakes]/fiveor equivalently           Fifteen equals[(six)(totalsecondspercube)-seventhandsixty]. From here its pretty evident what our answer ought to look like              let s denote initial investments.(i initially calculated wrongly before due my mathematical miscalculation.)

Well considering what we know already about the times so far \u2013 just summing them up would provide us information regarding whether our approach works well enough hence making sure no additional calculations come out redundant because those might contradict itself resulting either adding unnecessary operations causing complexity when not needed.\r\rSo let\u2019s add these steps together; First Side=  5 , Second Side =   10 & Third(+)=          No calculation involved due tot he fact that its dependent upon Previous One\u2026 \rTotal Time Spent till This Stage     Is :      Cumulative Elapsed Time Until Current Stages                            =           Sum Of Particular Timings Seen Till Now...
