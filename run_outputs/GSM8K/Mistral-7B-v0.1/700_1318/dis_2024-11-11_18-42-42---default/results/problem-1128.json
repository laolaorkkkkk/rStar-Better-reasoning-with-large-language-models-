It suggests we need this value approximately calculated as it might represent early adulthood range if not lower yet like teenage/youngest twenties or so. Given these details and constraints along side normal biological facts implying birthdays don't happen simultaneously among pairs sharing family bonding but rather within close vicinity interval duration which could vary significantly depending upon various factors including geographic location variances particularly significant time differences across vast longitudinal ranges encompassing entire calendar year timespan etc., thus possibly leading toward quite distinct individual lifecycle timing outcomes despite apparent similarity via kinship; therefore such contextual considerations warrant careful evaluation here before moving forward further analysis process ensuring accuracy maintained throughout while proceedings towards conclusive results achieved henceforth described below...

        " this as follows: let 'V' represent Vince's present age so V - 2 (this would mean Vince's age 2 years back). Accordingly since it's mentioned that his(liams)age was doubled during those times i.e., when liam turned (Liames)-2year=(Liame)-2*2i. We can write equation like; [(Liame)]=2*(V-(Liame))[here], ((LIAME)=present yearso((Lieame)(lmonths)+2yrsnow,(v),(nineteenyr+ten)), which means[(twelve yr]+two([seven][zero])=[sixteen](four)[yo]rmillenium)). Substituting numbers into our previous statement hence making sense according to conditions defined earlier ,we get ; [fifteen]=2.[eleven]; substituting tenfor vintoour expression,[three]= .Dividing both sides using divisionpropertywhichimplies:[five].As such ,using these mathematical steps above concludes or infersto :['Vincetotennythree'].Thus answering your question about,\"howoldishe?\"theexpressiontotenscorehasbeensimpliedasandanswerso:\"tenth\"wherever[[Five]]representsfivemonthstooneverythingaboveaccordingsaftermentionedconditionsestablishedatbeginningofquestionproblemstatementbeforequotingorreportindetailedinstructionsgivenwithmathematicstatementsperformedandsatisfiesallprecedingcriterionsintegralprogressionesucceededeffulfilledhenceconcludingfinalanswerthatwhenyouadditheseonedoublesahtotheneighborhoodbynineandsubstracttheninthousanethreetwofromitthereemergetsomeintendedresultnamely;\"[\"Tenth\"].So therefore finally statingyour askedresponsefollowinglyustosrespond:\"the",

Therefore, Accordingly, your conclusion seems right but you misspoke in identifying Liam's past age stating it as 32 instead of correct value based upon our calculation i.e., since Liam who presently is  16;two year back would actually be 16-2year=-age change indicating that liams present age equals double vincents former(since both figures seemingly correspond).
