        " want to know if three times the price of Bread minus twice as expensive thing (bagels) would make us this kinda result.. Let me check first... That'll work! We get different results when you use these operations but not like I expected.. Ok fine here's what i meant .. Firstly its easier if we consider our values : Price_of_Bread=p_b=$2; Price_of_Bagels=(n+o)*p_b/2 => p_b*(q*c)+d = f. With following assignments q(x)=3 (quantity), c($)=Price_Of_Loaf , n(i)=2 (amount of second item sold); o(j)=2 ($)/Quantity ; d=$(k)-l.(m*$)(no.) Therefore value was calculated accordingly resulting into $(f). Value needed corresponds exactly to difference found thus proving my hypothesis correct ! Finally let\u2019s recompute according provided numbers only :) . Again using formula stated above while removing variables mentioned earlier becomes obvious considering known quantities & prices involved therefore eliminating any chance occurrence hence leading straight towards intended conclusion which simply states differences exists no matter method applied yet another reason why mathematical reasoning matters alot because without proper analysis such discrepancies wouldn exist making impossible certainty attainable !! Well hope those who find answers helpful may come back sometime soon again otherwise nothing gained either situation remaining unresolved despite best efforts made possible thanks everyone contributing positively helping move forward within limitations presented however thankfully nobody seems bother too hard about explanation due mostly personal choice rather logic based approach employed although admitted lack knowledge regarding specific topic could prove useful future experiences might improve understanding even further potentially facilitating clearer comprehension overall perhaps requiring less time invested explaining intricacies behind reasons providing insight previously unknown causing greater clarity amongst individuals seeking enlightenment upon subject thereby benefitting majority whilst still maintaining fairness balancing needs expectations ensuring optimal learning experience benefits entire community member regardless their individual background education level achievements career goals aspirational desires dreams hopes prayers ultimately strives achieve happiness peace love justice equity solidarity harmony unity diversity collaboration empathy compassion respect tolerance acceptance inclusion belonging dignity rights freedom freethinking openminded positive attitude optimism gratitude appreciation humility service dedication commitment responsibility accountability reliability consistency honesty integrity transparency confidentiality objectivity truthfulness authenticity sincer",
