And because one half hour equates approximately twenty minutes when converted into segments based upon real world scenarios involving either driving vehicles including automobiles such truck transporters who carry cargo containers full size loads over long distances covering thousands if not millions kilometers across continents every single year via railroad tracks running parallel roads stretching mileaftermilethroughout several countries all whilst maintaining peak performance through their exhaust pipes powering engines generating enough force required push heavy vehicle mass forward causing them gain acceleration therefore allowing themselves remain upright while also continuously steering turning corner avoid collisions thereby providing safe passage along any roadway whether rural farmhouses pastoral landscapes populated solely comprising nature filled expansive fields blanketing valleys rolling hills farmlands covered crops growing grains harvests waiting till plowers plough shovellers cultivator scarecrows pickers peasants animals honeybees pollinators wagons reapers carts sacks potatoes broccoli carrots corn wheat barley olives grapes apples lemons bananas strawberries blue berries cherries kumquats tomatoes red cabbage sweet peppers green leafy vegetables lettuce salads celery cauliflower radishes garlic mint leeks shallots coriander arugula basil lavender chamomile rose petals rosemary sprigs catnip seeds clover grass spices olive oil vinegar sugar salt seasonings condiments etc other products made using plants grown naturally inside your home gardens outside backyard fenced yards borders walls garden corners gateways arch ways gates entrances exits doors windows shutters curtain panes blinds sunsets dawn dusks twilights midnight moonlight stars comets planets constellations galaxies superclusters blackholes whirlwinds clouds storm rain showers snowflakes hailstorms sleet iceberg floating sea level high waters deep ocean bottom below surface above ground height width diameter circum",

And what i told yall was pretty clear really right... it depends upon various variables including but not limited too :-)...for example assume let\u2019s say u call ppl like myself experts who work hard every day making sure nobody gets hurt or killed because sometimes traffic jams happen causing delays thus when someone wants answers such yours why don\u00b4t ask those people instead asking random strangers trying guesses until somebody says no way man thanks god im safe hahaha enjoy your daily life....",
