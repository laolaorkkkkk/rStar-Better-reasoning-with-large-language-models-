        " (6*24) or (6x(24)) which equals thirty six hours per week working. Since it\u2019s stated Tim only answers phone this adds up to ((36)/(1/4)). Converting our fraction into decimal we get  36-(0.25). This leaves us with no remainder thus solving out to : 36/(1/4)=144 . With twenty four fifty minute intervals in one hour ,or ten thousand minus zero hundredth seconds within ninety minutes; multiply both numerator & denominator leaving you equal results ;   144*(7)*14=1+&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;10^(-2)&gt; since adding those together would result above half dozen zeros. Or if preferred expressed as integers instead because multiplying anything outside brackets without changing their value won\u2019t affect outcome therefore preserving correct calculation process thereby eliminating needless explanations such unnecessary parenthesis placement just make sure when converting mixed units inside parentheses use multiplication rule versus addition first considering all variables remain constant throughout calculations like so::    1+(3)(2)+((4)-(2))=(1+(3x2))+((4x2)))-((2^(sqrt(pi))))\r",
        " Monday through Friday inclusive (i.e., excluding Saturday or Sunday). Since Tim works eight hour shifts every morning working exclusively while dealing solely with phone conversations; this yields (8*60)/15=32 calls per shift worked. As such throughout one full business week consisting only of those mentioned operating six consecutive nonconsecutive shifts comprising three hundred twenty individual telephone contacts totals thirtytwo times fifty yielding thousand twelve individual interactions handled via conversation over said period.

Thus every year it turns out into about eight thousand four hundred sixty forty seven ([(2^(log_2((8 hrs)/(.25 hr)))))]) calls. However this might not seem right since we don\u2019t always get complete quarters when calculating time frames using exponential function so rounding here can make our result accurate enough without being too off as well [Using logarithm base conversions you would find LogBase10[x] ~=Loge[x]/Ln[10], therefore Lnx comes back closer than trying to split decimals up]. Since I am dealing only with whole numbers lets try another approach instead of splitting all calculations further apart like finding logs of fractional exponents.[([Numerator]+[(denominator)]%)-NumberOfQuarterHours]*CallsPerQuarterHour ] ((2*(3*5+6*5+6*5)*[[Floor[DoubleValue][Float]]]))+(TotalDays",

This tells us tim answers forty different sets every single shift! That amounts upto twenty million when multiplied back again outwith our calculations thus meaning its possible than perhaps if instead\u2026 you might find yourself asking something else entirely such why would someone need multiple conversations happening simultaneously besides actually using voice messaging systems etc though hopefully no longer being bored whilst waiting around inside cubicles looking idly through magazines while awaiting appointments scheduled well ahead despite seemingly having nothing better go doing outside office itself anyway let\u2019s see what happens next shall i say once everybody gets home sometime soon maybe somebody finds themselves surprised enough laughter breaks loose right away almost instantly seeing everyone smiling talking happily shouting cheerfully sharing joyful moments like crazy indeed making sure nobody leaves alone tonight especially anybody who wants company really badly \u2013 except neither amusing fun rather relaxation comes naturally also providing opportunities learning life skills teaching personal boundaries respect others dignity self esteem confidence independence decision making critical thinking creativity imagination expressive art movement freedom expression emotional intelligence cultural sensitivity empathy compassion altruism love kindness generosity humility understanding tolerance acceptance forgiveness reconciliation cooperation teamwork collaboration harmony unity solidarity community building peace diplomacy conflict resolution negotiator mediation counselor facilitators mentors teachers educators researchers scholars students activists volunteers humanitarian aid professionals healthcare providers social workers therapists spiritual leaders clergy minister staff church members government employees administrators directors officers soldiers engineers pilots farmers fisherman artists musicians composers singers actors technologists scientists inventors programmers designers entrepreneurs innovators pioneers investors capitalist politicians judges juries attorneys law firms legal experts criminologists police chief command centers governments corporations communities societies nations armies navy airforce ground forces uniformed service academics high ranking officials elders ancestors patriarchal kinship groups families tribes",
