Finally Justin indeed own these US currency valued amounts totalling Thirty Nine Cent.(This problem really confused me.) It seems logical enough right?.

Multiplying everything once I\u2019ve summed these last few values ($8+$9.50+$6) times whatever represents another half dollar equivalent piece makes sense considering only having limited types/numbers so no need feel bad either :) That means our result becomes $(8+9.50)*(1+\\frac{1}{2})=~$17*1.5=$ ~~$25 Thus Justin actually holds around twentyfive USD bills within those confines...
