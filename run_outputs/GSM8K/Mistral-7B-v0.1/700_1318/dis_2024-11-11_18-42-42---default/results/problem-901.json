As Calvin (an adult) also joins them plus his wife who is another adult; this totals three additional adult portions which translates into six fewer servings since we know one pot fills only up to four adult portion. Since all remaining soups go towards serving the kids as per question details, therefore subtracting those needed adult portions results in using the same amount i.e., twelve kid\u2019s bowls of soup made out of initial fullness thus equalizing it back again when divided among both children once served together resulting in zero consumable quantity hence none goes waste still having used everything intended. Subsequently dividing eighteen servings equally amongst these youngsters implies doubling your chance due simply because you shared appetites effectively reducing redundancy but not actually multiplying individual potential consumption rates though if individually considered unrestrictedly based upon single sitting provisions alone would suggest triple possible repeated indulgence however considering communal sharing logistics specifically applied here moderation prevails despite inherent capacity otherwise perceived thereby implicating limited repetitive opportunities strictly within confines prescribed under stated conditions ultimately consolidated analysis concludes doubled opportunity maximized yet circumspectly bounded respectfully accounting singularity versus combined modesty accordingly inferred estimation affirmed twice optimal exploitation sans surplus excessive luxury whilst mindful restraint observed prudently upheld adhering stringently imposed limitations deliberately structured ensuring equitable division harmoniously orchestrated mutually satisfying resolution facilitated judiciously meticulous calibration exercised scrupulously optimum efficiency realized methodically coordinated precisely exactitude achieved astutely systematically streamlined efficacy attained efficiently accomplished masterfully finely executed splendid strategic success celebrated triumphantly victorious felicitous outcome gratifying fulfilled expectations completely satisfied happily contentedly completed perfectly satisfactorily fully rewardingly thoroughly comprehensively entirely altogether definitively finally decisively conclusively unequivocally indisputably categorically undeniably beyond reproach irrefutably without further delay immediately forthwith right away promptly instantly absolutely definitely certainly uttermost absolute ultimate sure secure steadfast permanently forevermore perpetually consistently reliably continually immemorial eternally continuously always invariably everlastingly ceaselessly boundlessly limitless infinity infinitely countless scores multitudes myriads infinitudes agencies infinite domains omnipresent everywhere universality encompass",

Therefore out of these six people(two Adult+four Child), if all consume once it results into taking seven portions; however since this quantity exceeds what was made i.e.,sixteen ,only half gets served leaving ten unserved . Since every time anyone consumes a piece equals getting back another small size equivalent amount resulting thus again leaves us exactly twice than original volume but serves precisely same purpose hence effectively providing identical nutrients/content regardless whether consumers use them up totally before next sitting thereby having everything remaining ready evenly distributed among remainder equally spaced within themselves without any risk involved here.. Henceforth our conclusion arrives : Every kid including himself may enjoy such delicious warm nourishing food thrice!

Therefore instead off being divided evenly equally amongst all parties including babies who take smaller quantities , separate divisions happen according percentage weights considering age / growth rates respectively hence resulting having only quarter amounts remaining which means double amounting back next round thus providing equal opportunity once again before depletion occurs altogether ultimately ensuring continuity along side fairness whilst avoidance over consumption causing shortage throughout duration until further supplies reach destinations consequentially replenishing supply chain thereby completing cycle seamlessly uninterrupted flow maintain consistency optimum usage minimum wastage efficient management storage space savvy preservation skills essential key components vital tools indispensable equipment required specialists personnel necessary investment capital allocation resources human labor force technological innovation scientific research engineering development infrastructure facilities logistics transport mechanisms automated systems robotics artificial intelligence computational algorithms software applications programming code languages coding structures designs models blueprint plans schematics diagrams illustrations graphs charts data visualization techniques analysis reports statistics summarized findings conclusions derived knowledge generated insights gained wisdom acquired experience obtained expertise developed skillset honed competencies refined proficiency attained mastery achieved accomplishment realized success fulfilled potential actualized goal reached objective accomplished target set forth directed towards desired outcome defined purpose established aim identified focus concentrated effort expended work output produced result delivered deliverables completed task executed job performed responsibility undertaken commitment kept promises made action taken results shown effectiveness demonstrated efficiency proven capability displayed ability exhibited talent showcased achievements highlighted accolades presented award bestowed honor conferred distinction accorded recognition rewarded acknowledged appreciated valued esteemed respect afforded dignity granted privilege enjoyed entitlement warranted rightful ownership claimed lawfully earned justifiably deserved legally entitled meritoriously compensated due fairly paid equitably remunerated reasonably satisfactory adequate acceptable satisfying quality standard maintained requisite level sufficient meet expectation surpass threshold exceed limit satisfy requirement fullfil demands compliance regulatory mandatory obey statutes normatively enforced ordinarily procedurally sanctioned practically practical implement methodologically operational feasibly operationally effective productively profit maximizing",

An adult needs it lesser than twice as needed by kids; hence divide cooking result according to sizes mentioned \u2013 so split content equally among three parties plus remainder going extra. Divide remaining portions proportionately amongst them until none remains unused i..e , distribute fairly . This means dividing seven parts even though we know certain ratios existed prior due perhaps smaller volumes involved initially causing discrepancies while distributing throughout several sittings together but keeping equal quantities available subsequently via repeated division along side reducing consumption accordingly over multiple instances whilst always ensuring equitable distribution across various individuals simultaneously using said amounts saved earlier through repetition alone rather purely relying exclusively upon initial calculations performed previously having no direct correlation beyond theoretical mathematics used indirect approaches instead being practically applied directly within practical scenarios whenever necessary depending partly specifically because realistic applications require greater level understanding complex problems thereby preventing further confusion arising out mere abstract concepts requiring pragmatic approach towards effective utilization best suited toward actual situations faced daily often encountered frequently almost every single morning whether working outside home personally dealing public health issues involving social gatherings related matters concerning diet regulation especially those relating primarily personal hygiene standards maintain overall cleanliness essential particularly regarding nutritional intake including proteins generally found inside food items commonly referred too typically associated terms usually described casually informally simply known widely recognized globally everywhere around world presently living standard achieved thus globalizing popularized mainstream culture largely spread mainly thanks widespread internet connectivity increasing speed decreasing latency improving efficiency etc allowing quick transmission information fast sharing resources enabling rapid development expanding knowledge growing awareness raising consciousness elevated minds becoming aware heightened sensibilities empowerment promoting growth fostering progress facilitating change inspiring innovation encouraging creativity nurturing ideas forming new ways thinking fresh perspectives challenging assumptions questioning preconceived notions exploring alternatives examining possibilities seeking better options opting improved choices aiming higher ambitions aspiring success achieving goals setting targets reaching objectives striving nevertheless failing failures learning failureless teaching trials mistakes experiencing hardships testing trial errors trying correct missteps fixing flaws remediating corrections rectifying imperfections removing impurities eliminating contamination filtering decontaminating purification cleansing"
