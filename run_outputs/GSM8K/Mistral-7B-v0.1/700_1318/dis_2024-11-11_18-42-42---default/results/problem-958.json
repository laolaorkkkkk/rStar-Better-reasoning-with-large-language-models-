This means multiplying as one full number minus those represented by multiplication results. You calculate these terms separately; add them together. It works if you perform only simple addition or subtraction operations without worrying about any commutative properties involved since such changes don\u2019t affect equality relations involving real numbers which follow basic mathematical rules when working correctly due reason known as closure property under operation \u2018addition.\u2019 Multiplying gets us 48 \u00d7 0.8 because \u201csubtraction\u201d can also just look like positive values being subtracted directly instead thinking negatives too\u2014and remember adding negative equals getting closer toward zero towards smaller distances away thus making everything simpler mathematically speaking!

Thus we get , New Value=OldValue-(Percentage*OldValue)/100 =>  48 -(20*(48))/100=>   48-(960)/100      [Calculation Result]    48-9.6               =                         [Final "
