We can represent these variables mathematically as follows:`length=(float(input(\"Enter First Song Time:\")))+((length*(int)(float(input('What percentage increase?'))))))` When entering parameters you enter them based off what your coding language supports so either integer input() function or float one depending whether integers require decimals etc...
