From Sunday however instead of only having Saturdays worth of vegetables being consumed he actually gets both Saturday & Sundays consumption adding just \u2018an extra 5,\u2019 into account therefore summing all values together brings us down to getting exactly 41 total servings within any seven consecutive working period; or simply put \u2013 \u201cIn terms of food intake quantity\u201d \u2026so your first thought might go something like : \u201dHey\u2026wait what??
