        " second individual according to the relation with first. Accordingly, if 'x' represents the amount received by the first person, considering these relations, the shares become as follows:- Second individual receives (x+$80). Third Individual gets double the sum taken by the Second \u2013 i.e., (2*(x+$80)) Which means all sums together becomes equal to our original equation which reads: `Total Amount ($1920) = Sum up everything.` This translates into Equation : `$1920=x+(x+$80)+(2*(x+$80))`. Let\u2019s simplify further:$1920=x + (x+80) + [2*(x+80)].$ Distributing inside brackets results: '$1920=x + (x+80) + 2*x + 160.' Combine like terms: '$1920=(x + (x+80) + 2*x + 160),` Reducing again leads us to:' '$1920=4*x+240.' To isolate \u2018X,\u2019 move constants toward side B: `'1920-240=4*x'` Simplifying produces,' `$1680=4*x`, Resultant value when dividing both sides over constant equals:`'$1680/4 = x', leaving only '$420='` thus concluding; The First Person takes exactly `$420.` The answer is: \\$420.",

Therefore we get equation as follows :  X+(X+80)+(2*X+160)$= 1920; simplifying this expression results into  4X + 240=$1920 or simplified even further ,   4x=1680 which implies     x=420 Dollars . ",

Simplifying even further leads us up until:(3S)+2F^2-(S)=1920.$ Solving such quadratic formula yields us three answers; but only negative ones make sense when speaking about dividing sums, thus making them null possibilities..
