To calculate these kinds of problems you first need to find out how long was your trip if I assume one hour covers less than half kilometer because every full stop means not driving. Since my rate doesn\u2019t match up exactly with hours riding time since rest times count too but just going off numbers alone...you divide them both equally dividing mileages among those four categories thus getting about three quarters plus whatever leftover fraction comes along maybe another third fifth sixth seventh\u2026so something roughly equalling fifty miles divided either seven hundred twenty eighty ninety fifteen forty six point oh minus ten seconds apart; however most likely near enough!
