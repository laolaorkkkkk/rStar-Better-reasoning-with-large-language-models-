        " Tuesday combined as well as on Thursday and Friday. It mentions these totals directly within the question: Monday & Tuesday (M&T) saw 1907 reported submissions; while the same goes for both Thursday & Friday denoted hereafter as THF \u2013 those sessions resulted in 2136 filings submitted. Since we know which numbers correspond to M&T and WEDNESDAY versus THF plus FRI AND SATURDAY it becomes quite easy to calculate using subtraction what happened during any individual session/week\u2019s business hours. Thus this formula helps us break down our overall process easily into smaller sections so let me show you my work below! Firstly subtract your \u2018received_on\u2026\u201d results together before multiplying them against relevant weeks values again since every variable plays its own part when solving problems like mine mathematically speaking : Subtract Total Receipts From All Period Of Reporting Duration(Excluding Outlier Sections)(e.g.: Remove Weekend And Holiday Entries)+ Multiply Both Results By Previous Unknown Variable To Get ",
        " this result (Monday+Tuesday) by 2 because you want only one portion out of those two totals i.e., You need just one or half value which would represent either report counts occurred individually during these particular days . Therefore calculate as follows:(Total Reports \u2013 Report Count [Mon&Tue])/Number Of Days; Hence ,(Report Total\u2013Day\u2019s M & T)+Reports Received per Day=Amount Calculated ;Substitute values calculated earlierin placeofvariableswhichincludetotaltaxreportsrecievedpriorweekandreportcountreceivemonthenovertousetoamountofprocesstoidentifymeetingshortcomingwednedsinceitscalculationisformerequalfractionthanindividualdays.(Receives Per Day)=((Receievespreviousweekstax\u2014Receiptsmond&tuedoesnotincludethurdatewithdatafromthosedates))/(NoOfDaysincludingallthreeoutstandingperiod).To find outthevalueperdailywecalclastequationasfollowsonceonlyoneinputparametervalueshavebeenestimatedatpresenttimepointa=(Forecasttotaltax receipts\u2212forecasttedotalamountcoveringmonntheydidrecorduptotheithirddatedocument)[Alldocumentsexcludingtwoofthesodatewillgetprocessedusinganotherspecifiicmethodbasedupontheimodelthatcanhandleanynumberofvariationsaccommodatingmultiplepossibilities].Example:[Received Tax Returns From April Through June]=$ 923,[Hard Copy Filers]([Document Categories Being Used][Copies Withdrawn By Former Employees])=[$103,(+$5)/employeeworkyear],[Previously Unknown Individual Filers]=($[$300]/x)$([Paper Copies Not Destroyed Before Mail Settlement])[][-Dropped Off At Bureau Office],[(Other Documents)(Incorrectly Stamped Due To Technical Error)]-$()=-(-),$(Process Time And HoursNeededPerForm)]([Bureau Operational Cycle Rates]+[Average Process Times]),Reduction%=$(Expected Decline DuringBusySeasons)^-(^Declaration Sequence)*(%Discriminatory PracticesUpheld),(Rate AdjustmentsAndCostImpactsByState())*(PercentageGovern",
        " per day (since it was over 2 days). Doing this calculation gets us: \\( \\frac{1907}{2} = 953.5 \\) Reports/Day; however we cannot count half a report so round down since you can\u2019t submit only part of one return which equals 953 Report(s)/Day for both days combined. Using subtraction, subtract all known receipts before Wednesday from the original amount reported submitted to find out what remains unaccounted till Wednesday. Firstly calculate summed up reception through Mondays & Tuesdays as well as Fridays & Thursdays (\\(953+953\\)+\\(2136\\))= \\(\\approx 3042\\). Since these represent collective totals across multiple specific periods rather than individual daily figures during these timespans, divide them again but into separate entities representing single instance rates respectively within those time frames separately \u2014 resulting upon doing such division would yield approximate values like below-\\[\\begin{array}{rcl}\\text{Monday Receipt Rate:}&\\,\\,&=\\,\\dfrac{1907}{2}=953.5\\\\\\text{Friday&Tuesday Combined Rate:}&\\,\\,&=\\dfrac{2136}{2}&=&\\,1068\\\\\\end{array}.\\] Next off utilise mathematical operation methodology based conceptually around deductions i.e., taking away certain sums herefrom main bulk figure hence accountable remaining quantity becomes evident subsequently when performing appropriate arithmetic operations involving proper variable assignment using relevant numerical data presented above.\\nHaving taken apart respective parts furthermore applying suitable computation skills including basic mathematics principles alongside logical reasoning enables identification or extraction process thereby pinpoint precise unknown value denoted earlier stated contextual clue 'what happened on Wednesday?'
