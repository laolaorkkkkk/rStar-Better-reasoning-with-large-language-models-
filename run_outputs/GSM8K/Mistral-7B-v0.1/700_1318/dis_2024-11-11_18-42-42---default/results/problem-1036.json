        " divide 80 (total apples) by 8 (apples per pack). This results in exactly 10 full packs. Therefore, Uncle Franky could make ten complete apple packs using all the apples without any leftovers. Final ",
        " Therefore, you could fill up ten apple packages using all fourty oranges (because order doesn\u2019t matter). As such your calculation seems correct but I guess what makes my output differing slightly than yours was the question asked as below; \u201cHow many packs\u201d. You meant we only needed to compute value per single Box i.e., quantity/size so our computation shall look like following : Quantity=Total Apples Per Pack Sizex Amount(Quantities) hence Total apps required divided by Max capacity of single package amount . Hence lets change it little bit ,how about asking\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019ll be remaining unboxes when filled?\u201d Let me know if any further clarification needs",
        ". I hope you find these examples helpful! Let me know if you need further assistance or explanations."
