Next, Third day would equal (Second day*2), which means it equals (2*70)=140 since both sides multiply evenly without remainders or decimals as needed when dealing with whole counts/ numbers . Thus far our three known data points are : D1(50);D2(70);and D3(140). As stated ,six remaining unaccounted values needing averaging into place exist hence totalling up all seven accountable values revealing their summation comes outto be ??? This last piece of information was not provided so unfortunately I am unable provide you with exact figure here.. But using logic if these six 'remaining unknown quantities...were also represented like this set example {x_n} such that ..X^n ~ n > N starting off big enough until hitting desired accuracy limit can help find required overall quantity via arithmetic sums methods etc! Assuming typical human countage scenarios might apply ; thus potentially being most sensible route taken considering potential impact factors relating specific individual occurrences vs population dynamics over timeframe periods versus random sampling effects generally seen across varied localities worldwide within specified domain bounds usually used scientific fields involving social research studies typically carriedout through systematic surveys covering wide area populations groups including but limited only towards generalized estimations about behavior patterns trends changing behaviors adaptive survival traits evolutionary mechanisms emergent phenomena complex systems interactions interpersonal relationships group dynamic coherence stability equilibrium balancing acts collectivist cultural identity mindset orientation diversity acceptance inclusivity tolerance resilience coping strategies solidarity support networks communitarian spirit compassion mutual aid reciprocity altruism shared responsibility cooperative teamwork collaboration trust respect dignity rights justice equity equality fairness mercy humility empathy understanding sympathy generosity forgiveness patience hope optimism determination courage fortitude tenacity bravery leadership wisdom intelligence creativity inspiration joy happiness pleasure contentment wellbeing mental health spiritual growth self-actualization personal development fulfillment meaning purpose life satisfaction abundance prosperity wealth success fame recognition power influence authority prestige status honor honour reputation privilege advantage opportunity luck destiny fate karma divine plan providence god blessings supernatural guidance angels archangels guardians cel"
