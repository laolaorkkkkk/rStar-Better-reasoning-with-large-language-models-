Percent means out of every hundred units calculated but here we don\u2019t want to go beyond or touch fullness hence round off till next whole digit as decimal places can only account up until last moment precision reached.. You might note if doing calculation without using math skills like having calculator handy etc still manages through mental computation just fine though sometimes extra steps make our lives easier than trying remember everything ourselves!

Well really nothing wrong about getting close enough actually since most things aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t precisely exact anyway , especially when dealing wth real numbers rather mathematics paper theory kindsa stuff .

        " means they spend 15*80=<<15*80=1200>>1200 minutes (or <<1200/60=20>>20 hours) cleaning all the rooms. Each working day consists of 8*60=<<8*60=480>>480 minutes or 8 hours. Therefore if we divide these times so as to find out exactly what part of time was taken up on daily basis, this can be calculated as follows : Time used per day / Total possible time available   =>       (1200 Minutes)/(480 minutes/day)= <<1200/480=2.5>>2.5 Days. Hence finding Percentage would require us to calculate    %Time Spent Cleaning =     ((time Taken \u2013 Day Given To Complete Task )Day Possible Available)*100      Thus;        %Time Spent Cleaing Classrooms=(2.5days\u22125d)+((8\u221760min))/(5\u22178\u221760 min)&gt;&gt;         (*Note I\u2019m adding zero because negative value isn\u2019t mathematically correct.)               .5+.(480min)-(.48\u00d75)                           =              (.5/.20)(hours);          ",

Overall, these mean being occupied  1200 / 480 = 2.5 times during those eight hrs , so if divided into percentages; we need to take away our rest breaks (lunches) as well .
