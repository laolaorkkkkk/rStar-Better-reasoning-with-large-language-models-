Lastly, we need to calculate their additional fee based off usage. Since every task takes longer than expected(in this case broken bone needed medical attention), they require additional time parking resulting into further expenses. Parking was billed as $6 per hour regardless whether useful service gets delivered using them during these times or otherwise. That means you get double charged if your procedure last overestimated initial estimated time.(Because most likely nobody wants pay twice when expecting single amount).
