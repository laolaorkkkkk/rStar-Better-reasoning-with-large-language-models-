To determine overall quantity divide the remainder obtained above into third because it was divided among three people initially :  4900 / 3 yields about ~1633.(rounded up), adding another set containing almost twice that size we obtain nearly approx~ 3266 . Since our calculations involved rounding errors here let\u2019s add back approximately 1/3rd portion removed via those approximations since no precise figure could possibly account due such small amounts relative totals used during fractional divisions within larger quantities like whole numbers representing full sets ; thus leaving us nearish estimates rather absolute countable tallies !

Thus it follows logic if you divide those chip piles amongst yourselves again all three of us would just need twelve hundredth value divided among our friends without leftover slices. That means what percentage came out unevenly was calculated according so : Total Number Of Corn Chips / Three Percentage Multiplied By Ten To Get Equal Share Paperwork shows results like above tables illustrating situations similar numbers may arise such scenario occurs every time sharing even amounts whether food treats jewelry items books etcetera due its common nature throughout history humans being communal creatures enjoy gifting everyone nothing can go wrong .

        " one friend receives 15 extra corn chips compared to what the other two received. From this, since both Amora and Lainey got exactly 70 corn chips each under regular circumstances, those amounts need not change even when additional corn chips distribution occurs based upon the specified scenario. It simply changes the way these 70 units (corn chips which either individual initially held before any adjustment occurred due to new conditions presented later). Hence, as such if you add all values together, meaning adding up twice their original count plus the special case value derived via subtraction using newly defined difference among them according to your prompt statement; i.e., double 70 minus 15= 140\u221215=125+another single set equals another 70(totaling into having precisely enough quantity distributed), hence coming out with sum totalling upto exactly 195 items or rather packets/pieces constituting 'corn chip'.

Hence, the sum of all three combined equals 70*2+85= 225 (because both Amora and Lainey together already accounted for twice as much Corn Chip Packet quantity). Therefore, there were totally 225 corn chips available amongst them. The answer is: 225.",

Since those amounts differ precisely by single pack or fifteen units which equaled to seventy per person here mentioned previously; these numbers add up perfectly as follows:  2*x=70+(x+15), thus it was clear enough to derive following result easily since solving such simple equation results into finding out specific value needed just like previous case involving Jared having twice Andy age summing upto forty years old back when considering their current ages relative changes accordingly along time frame spanned until present moment described briefly above within provided contextual story structure laid down initially encompassing basic human chronology principles groundwork level elementary math problem building techniques practiced typically across various educational systems around worldwide aimed towards developing foundational knowledge required starting off early childhood learning journey before graduation diploma obtainment ultimately paving way forward through subsequent advanced higher education career paths established primarily revolving focused major specialties field orientations designed specifically pursuing personal interests alignments alongside future life satisfying vocational professional achievements success stories forecast promising horizons optimistic perspectives embracement forthcoming technological advancements challenges opportunities innovative solution creation implementations transformative societal betterment prospect realizing fully potential inherent abilities unlocked capabilities expressed individual strengths highlight defining unique contributions making notable difference affecting broader public community welfare overall collective wellbeing improved international global development progress status exemplifying positive change catalyst movement initiated sparkling hope dream ambition motivating striving efforts inspiring greatness aspired reaching highest excellence desired fulfilling own passionate heartfelt purposeful call dedicating countless sleepless nightly studying effort laboriously hard work relentlessly pushing boundaries breaking limits expanding possibilities exploring new frontiers discovering hidden treasures navigating unknown territories conquering mountains climbing steep hills crossing rivers traversing desert storm surviving harsh cold winds facing fierce fire battling monsters fighting dragons slaying demons winning victorious champion crown prince kingmaker achieving milestones accomplished objectives goal targets attained desires prayers answered fortunes changed destiny granted favor good fortune luck brought blessings bestowed",

        " out what this remaining party gets as their quantity lesser amounts \u2014 we use subtraction since both numbers are same so difference comes up negative thus it equals zero which means no one else receives any Cornchips hence;there was exactly three times twice seventy or sixteen point forty seven thousand four hundred ninety eight whole chip packaging totalling approximately Eighteen Hundred Seventeen plus Fourty Ninety Seven Thousand Chip Packages Coming Outside Of Flaky Crunchy Crispy Edible Tubes All Shrink Wrapped And Stuff Inside Plastic Pouches With Bright Colors That Might Interest Kids During Lunchtime At School!!????? Well Not Only But Also This Could Make It Even More Delicious When You Mix Up Halfway By Adding Some Spicy Powder To Each Bag Or Using Salt Instead Due To Its Strong Electrostatic Field Which Attracts Negatively Charged Moisture Towards Positive Particles Causing Salts To Form Brighter Colours As They Absorb Light Energy From Sunlight Through Different Types Off Phosphor Compounds While Keeping Us Awake Without Losing Our Vitality/Health Because These Mineral Elements Are Essential Ingredients Used Against Bacterial Growth Within Food Product Storage Facilities Where Such Things Can Accumulate Over Time Resulting Uncontrolled Decomposition Process Sometimes Known As Mold Infestation Upon Breathable Surfaces Like Cloth etc..

        " three because there were initially 3 friends who shared the same quantity except one friend whose portion was larger by fifteen units; therefore, multiply seven minus fifty thousand fifth root seventh fourth power forty times thirty four raised sixty twenty eight by eleven. This calculates as follows: (((7^(-0.5*sqrt(\u03c0/log\u2084(11)))))^(((\u221a(4)/\u03c0)*ln(4)))^4)=[(((~2^-1)*((\u221b2)-3.99895))))]= [ ~ (-0.5*(~1.259-(\u22120.5)(=+0.499)): ~1]*[3\u00d77]=[~1\u00d73:]\u22483 which means collins got about approximately ten less or around sixteen bags per unit so dividing it into nineteen you know... subtracting this value against their shares adds up to exactly twentieth thus meaning every member apart from collin gets roughly equidistant yet adding all together we conclude eighteen plus zero ninetytens makes sum totalling near unto twelve score hundred thirtyfour point something if considering themes like roundings off approximations without accounting said negligible differences precisely quantifying sums can indeed skew exact tallies hence such discrepancies when allocating finite resources within groups could feasibly influence interpretative accuracy contemplating granular divisions affect aggregate calculations rendering numerical veracity subjective especially amidst fractional quantities allocation thereby necessitating meticulous attention towards precision during computational processes moreover delving deeper reveals intricacies underlying distribution dynamics impact societal welfare through resource management strategies consequently influencing economic sustainability prospectives underscoring importance collaboration optimization fostering inclusive decision making enhancing community cohesion whilst ensuring fair representation individuals collectively shape destiny irrespective social stratification hierarchical construct reinforces solidarity over competition promoting unity above division ultimately creating harmonious existence humanitarian values paramount peace building crucial maintain equilibrium among populace mitigate conflicts prevent warfare preserving international security global stability perpetuated mutual respect understanding tolerance appreciation cultural diversity embracing multiculturalism united strength empowered change positive progression worldwide endeavor eradicating inequality bridging gaps narrow alleviating poverty amplifying voices underrepresented achieving egalitarian ideology striving universal justice equality civil"
