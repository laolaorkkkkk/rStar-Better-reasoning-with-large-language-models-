Therefore, if these particular berries came from a supermarket or farmer\u2019s market shelving area allotting them for around six cents every single one gram($0.006), you would pay roughly as follows \u2013 To get about three kilograms(kgs)=equivalent to 30 liters, meaning we could deduce approximately twenty billion grams, therefore sixty million instances multiplied consequently with individual pricing produces what amounts to thirty USD [cash amount]for exactly the same quantity gathered via self sufficiency measures[from farm visits], yielding net savings thus equalling; $.

First find out what the actual sum would be if these bushes went into supermarket conditions instead or was purchased straight off their stalls/farm fields respectively. Store purchase calculation :  30 kg \u00d7 $2.5 /kg= $75 .
