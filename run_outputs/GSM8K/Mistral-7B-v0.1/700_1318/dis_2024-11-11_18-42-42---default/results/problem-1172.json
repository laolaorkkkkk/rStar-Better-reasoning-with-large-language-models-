But our focus here isn\u2019t really whether these seeds might come together nor when last seen forming new ones because unlike real weather patterns those kinds don't occur randomly but rather systematically according fixed rules applied everywhere equally over time resulting consistent outcomes always identical throughout space&time provided initial conditions remain unchanged otherwise called deterministic chaos theory based prediction methods known scientific approach requiring careful observation testing comparing results checking against theoretical models validated experimenting reworking refining hypotheses repeatedly iteratively searching deeper knowledge towards solving complex problems using modern mathematics techniques involving calculus differential equations systems matrices integrals partial derivatives numerical simulations algorithms data mining neural networks machine learning deep reinforcement learning quantum physics optics statistics thermodynamics fluid mechanics electromagnetism nanotechnology chemistry biochemistry materials science engineering geosciences environmental studies political sciences economics philosophy psychology sociology anthropology astronomy astrophysics cosmology earth sciences atmospheric physics climate change hydrology marine biology oceanography glaciology soil science agricultural meteorology crop production animal husbandry fisheries aquaculture petroleum exploration energy technology renewable power generation electric utilities transportation fuel efficiency hybrid vehicles solar photovoltaics wind turbines hydraulics pumps engines combustion processes chemical process industry computer model simulation computational analysis artificial intelligence big data analytics cybersecurity ethical hacking information security cryptography internet networking wireless communications electronic commerce social media mobile applications digital marketing web development software programming algorithm optimization database administration business management project planning requirements assessment design specification procurement quality control supply chain logistics customer relationship sales forecast demand estimation inventory tracking warehouse automation robotics mechatronics industrial controls manufacturing operations management enterprise resource planning accounting finance capital markets investments risk management financial instruments trading strategies hedge funds venture capital private equity leverage liquidity loan agreements debt financing bonds credit lines asset allocation diversification portfolio construction active versus passive indexing index fund exchange-traded fund mutual fund dividend payback ratio return on investment net present value internal rate of return cost basis exp",

Overall over these entire fours days (Monday till Friday) , Alice enjoyed seeing  3+6+12+24=45 different shades of white fleckle formations drifting lazily above our heads amidst Earth\u2019s stratosphere throughout those four afternoons..

By adding up everything together it\u2019ll equal 3 (monday) + 6(tuesday)+ 12 (wednesday) + 24 (thursday) + 48 (friday).

        " 24 puffs on Thursday. Alice saw twice the amount (24) pupils than on Wednesday. This results into counting half as many cloud formations which equals out to 12 cumulus columnae during sunset hours. To summarize these numbers, you multiply like this; 3*1+6*2+12*4+24*8=162. Therefore, the sum would equal or exceed approximately four hundred twenty one thousand eight hundred ninety six when we group them together. It might take over seven months working without sleeping to get here because our earth takes about fifty times longer time round its axis compared to the moon\u2019s own orbit around Earth so imagine if those moons crossed their paths! The answer is:  162. Unfortunately I misunderstood what exactly was being asked initially but my apologies nonetheless.. Consider also whether any particular phase changes within such large groups could affect observations/interpretation rates based solely upon duration since birth alone pertaining individuals involved... Yes it appears only numerical data exists currently regarding specific age ranges associated specifically wthin mentioned topic(ie : weather patterns )although certain studies may exist exploring correlations possibly indirect evidence suggests presence perhaps slight correlation however further research needed ultimately determining causal factors underlying phenomenon observed overall general assumption seems plausible due predominantly unaccountable variables yet limited quantifiable measurements found thus far .
