When Boris gifts Beck an additional ten (10) apples it means the quantity borris held decreases while amount possessed by bake increases; hence we subtract these gifted apples both sides respectively since their relation remains constant even when change occures thus: new count for Boris becomes old value minus what was borrowed or equal but lesser(because not reciprocally transferred), therefore counting gets reduced making them uneven if original numbers remain same i.e., let\u2019s define n_beck=new amt possessible by B as equation no .\u2460b=(n_beck)=old val+(gift)+o difference maintaining status quo meaning keeping inequality/difference non zero here implies equality holds only true IF AND ONLY IF condition allows comparison such cases like exchange rate among currencies etc..
