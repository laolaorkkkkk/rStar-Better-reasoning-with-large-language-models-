To compensate for this loss while gaining enough time overall towards achieving exactly sixty freshly made spheres without counting partial losses during shorter intervals we add just the needed amount above our target considering only whole numbers\u2014specifically adding up excess amounts until reaching six times ten yields fifty additional batches instead than twenty alone would suffice due to half production rates versus full depletion scenarios over even periods like thirty seconds or fifteen such as earlier calculated calculations might lead us astray through misleading linearity assumptions about real continuous processes involving both addition & subtraction events happening concurrently!

        " That means over an hour (or four intervals of 15 minutes),  2*4=8 snowballs get destroyed per hour. But Jay only makes enough new ones to keep up this rate because while building those freshly made ball last, you still lose existing one(you built them when). Thus we cannot count any reduction just due diligence as opposed gain here nor could accounting loss separately simply since net accumulation remains steady during same period frame; instead better visualize scenario graphically representing cumulative changes & plotting resultant values versus time elapsed within specified span .

Hence in terms of complete bundles instead, four times per set period means eight snowballs go poof over those same periods during these thirty cycles because twice what vanished already minus this extra factor implies just half again worth disappearing overall!

However considering the melting rate we calculate above (which occurred over half our calculated period), within one full hour around four additional ones would likely also go missing due to their reduced sizes/heat exposure. To reach net positive gain including both made AND surviving count, Jay needs slightly longer than exactly an hour because only about 19+((2*1)/(2^x))=net gained actually gets accumulated during this interval; thus approximating towards next whole value shows us what minimum duration needed hereinforces maintaining steady production rates while factoring said loss simultaneously into equation like '[made]-( [lost]*number_of periods)'.
