And since it says one pen was also bought, we multiply its individual pricing i.e., $.5 times 1 resulting into .$5(cost for one ballpen only), Add up these costs so overall; you get them spent out as follows Total amount = Cost_of_notebooks+Cost_of_ballpen = $7.5+$0.5=Total amout=$8($this means wiliam spent eight dollars.). The answer is : $8$.   Q.:Now Alice needs another packing material but this time around instead of wrapping individually like previously she decided to group seven pairs together first before using the roll. Before grouping what if I tell you initially when unravelled there being ten full wraps over four units long ,what quantity of length remain undraped ? First let us find out the initial wrapped size of cloth needed. One single pair requires $\\frac{1}{2}$ foot cut off due to needing half wrap covered twice. Therefore, for seventy two paired clothes or sixty four halves coverage can cover about thirty three feet ($\\frac{64}{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{128}{2}=64$). Given that forty percent remains unwrapped already thus calculating remaining twenty six inches equate to roughly eighteen twelve inch sections minus eleven equalizing to approximately seven whole lengths without any piece attached!

To find out whether or not William spends less than ten dollar bills before being exchanged for twenty four cents change you take into account these three values:$((1)*(x)+(.5))=($.01)$|lessthan$(x)|<(.$10.=.$10.(the maximum spent)). From here , solving : |.-$ ((1*pound),(point,.fifty pence)-.(change))-$10.<.zero|$ leads us to solve following equation using zero instead negative sign:-[(price-(ten thousandth)][$10.]=>[1+(hundredth*.pence]>= [.1]=>[price].To get rid of decimal part move point rightwards till first integer appears next door,-multiplied both sides witin ($1.) so our solution becomes:(.[.twenty forty][tenth])>=([Price]).From above,(this holds true when [(two quarter points)>=[.25]$)$.Now check what happens if PENNY PRICE increases..ie., increase hundredth place digit until fifty cent value occurs....we know already-->->>(five QPRITC places)[HUNDREDTH].[FIFTEEN]->>>(fifteen quarters)$$<=$$<-(original seven ninety five cents)--$-[Ten Dollar bill]+[-nine nineties plus-.eighty]=-<<(-.--zero)..so YES!

Therefore, our final sum would equal $8 exactly $(because when calculating amounts involving decimals , always line up decimal points ).
