        " Martha's turtle. Since we also know the speed of Martha's cat (i.e., it's able to go up to 15ft per second), so this means the turtle would travel half as fast since their respective speeds differ by a factor of approximately twice because one value equals exactly 5 units while the other amounts only to about 2 or slightly less due to rounding errors during intermediate calculations). That makes our initial equation roughly equivalent to; T(t)~T'(c)(5)=D(t)/dt=C*r . Using values C=2 & r=(rate)_Cat_to_(Rate)_Turtle => DV'((T))=. When solving such problems you want your independent variable to always stand outside all terms inside whatever derivative operator like above ^ I suppose here _Time_.

        " at 15 fps (feet per second), this means Martha\u2019s Cat speed=CatSpeed=C; Turtle Speed would equal half since it goes only as fast as C / 5. This leads us to the following equation because we want distance over time which equals speed :    **Tur_distance(t)= Tur_speed*Time** , so   .....      **Distance(40 sec) = ((15 ft./sec)/5)*40 secs**     Distance=((15ft/.))*(40secs).
