        " original question (Q): To find out how many books Bob buys if you divide them equally among three schools(A), you need first know whether or not the quantity represents whole units only; because it refers as \u201cbooks\u201d, this means these quantities represent indivisible entities, therefore when dividing amongst equal groups/schools any fractional remainder would prevent us having exactly even numbers representing said groupings \u2013 making ",

        " 3 = $9000 spent equally among three places which means Bob needs enough funds to purchase 9000/500*100=180 book sets. But since this amount requires us finding out only one set; (one set includes 3 copies because these need not belong separately). Thus, we get equal amounts divided like this as below..(We first divide it into half considering both sides)",
        " groups of books Bob buying equals one book group which contains ten (X)number_of_books=  54* X=. It follows that Number of Books Per School=(total No/Number Of School)= . Since there are three(N), we divide this product value equally among them so ,",
        " distribute this among the 3 schools evenly so Bob could buy only about 54 / 3 book sets or about equal share which means approximately around  18 books (as actual division may not provide exact amount due to rounding). Since one set includes multiple copies as mentioned before let\u2019s count them out again; since these numbers won't divide exactly without remainder it implies you would need additional fund specifically allocated toward making sure all purchases align perfectly but if considering just approximate distribution possible within provided sum equals roughly 18*3= 54 books across three institutions combined hence averagely approximated equitable allocation leads towards approx same quantity i.e., ~18 title instances granted to individual academic establishments collectively.

This ratio implies that each unit (either a single dollar or individual quantities) represents approximately fifteen units worth when dealing with larger denominations like hundreds or thousands. Therefore we calculate as such; if all three schools receive equal amounts ($27000/3), this would mean each institution receives around $(27000/3)/(15)=$)4500/. Given these calculations, knowing that each set of ten books costs fifty dollars means twenty sets\u2014twenty times thirty equate forty thousand divided into hundred groups equals fourteen tens resulting in sixteeny plus eight extra cents.
