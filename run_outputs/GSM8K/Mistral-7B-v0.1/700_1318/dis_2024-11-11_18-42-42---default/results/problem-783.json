        " oranges than whites when combined together, it can also mean these groups form equal halves (or one half being double another). We know initially we have only whole numbers; hence this implies there could not exist exactly same amount of other colors either \u2013 since adding new species cannot break such integer balance while maintaining 'double ratio'. Therefore all newly introduced fish belong exclusively to any single color group. Let\u2019s say \u2018x\u201d was the quantity picked up recently which entirely belongs to \u201cwhite\u201d. Equation emerges based upon known information like below, considering \u2018y\u2019 represents additional count of Orange taken during recent collection :   y(White) + x= Total White Fish Left    Similarly , yellow stands here representing counts of Oranges already having present . i.e.,     Yellow+ X      [Twice No Of Whites ]       [(Total Number Existing)-Yield]                               \u27f5 Solving Further |             ||||            |        **Step**         =========================|              |----------------------->          It says Bought Count needs calculation meaning solving above equation further yields actual value represented against variable \u2018x\u2018.

        " would make sense if half those 17 new fish (i.e., rounded down) are white => 8/2=4.
