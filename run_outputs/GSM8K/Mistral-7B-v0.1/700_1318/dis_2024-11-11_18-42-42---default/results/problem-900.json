It says denite read 'x' more than thrice as many pages Daniel(yesterday) so we substitute y=13 which equals to: x+thrice*y or simplified into, three times twenty plus fifteen becomes thirty one. Add this value onto Denise\u2019s previous page count i.e., fifty minus forty means ten. Adding these together yields fourteen. Fourteenth represents the number of extra pages Denise spent over all twelve pages Dancelted last night. Therefore subtracting eighteen from sixteen reveals she spends eight less pages overall compared to him based off those numbers alone. Subtract eleven thousand seven hundred seventyfour from nineteen point zero four billion four thousand sixty-seven million three hundred fortyfive thousand herewith results you get negative yearly income; meaning your earnings fell short throughout entire duration despite working full time under normal conditions every single hour within regular operating hours during respective periods mentioned above including taking vacation leave if applicable either paid holiday allowance granted otherwise unpaid sick leaves taken etc..
