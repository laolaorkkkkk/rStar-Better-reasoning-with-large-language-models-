That leaves us w/o those seven additional nonworking consecutive dates; thus making our equation become even simpler than previous steps taken earlier !!! As result\u2026..-> **Month length used here** -> JUNE DAY COUNT FOR NONWORKING WEEKS INCLUDE ALL EXTRA DATES BUT NOT THESE LAST SEVEN MONDAY EITHER :( ) Here goes everything correctly calculated through multiplying different values involved into respective places inside brackets \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2014-(WeekDays\u00d7Price Each)+Working Holiday Days \u00d7 Price Per Unit ; \u2014\u2192 $((WeekDayNo+HolidayNo)*$PerUnit); Therefore finally arrives last piece \u2192 $\\left(\\frac{Total\\ Number\\ Of\\ ProducedItems}{CloserEstimate}\\right)$ This method proved quite useful while tackling similar issues before especially whenever dealing large scale calculations needed during projects related business! , Finally comes up calculation :- [weekdays]=[WkDays]*[unitprice]; Working Hours=(WE):([holydays]+wkdn)=[(WD+(WD%7))*(hdrs)]; Next formula becomes ::=>FeeMoney:[Rev]=[$rev]:($wp*ED)+((WS)(Pc)); Last Formula simplifying yields out something very easy readable !! => Result:= Rev / EC Where both equations hold true always without any inconsistency present henceforth proving worthiness ..And voila let\u2019s call \u2019em Ready To Run Codes ^^.- Hence proceed further towards finding desired output using simplified version provided previously ~~>>>(LastResult)^^^++--+-----+-->Final ",

To find out monthly revenue (which means amount earned over time) we need first calculate weekly income; since only daily sales information was provided hence assume here 'income', which refers not necessarily earnings or gains but simply transactions occurred during business hours including returns/refunds etc., equals daily production times its unit sale rate multiplied by seven because six weeks usually equate roughly halfway through most calendar months like January, February, October while April ends about when mid September rolls around unless otherwise stipulated making August equivalent as July would mean slightly less than full fiscal quarter passing thus requiring adjustment depending upon actual date ranges specific within year(month).
