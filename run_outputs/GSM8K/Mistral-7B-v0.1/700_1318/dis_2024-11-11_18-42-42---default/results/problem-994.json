According to the information provided, Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolf combined which translates into 2(20) + 40=80 second or approximately 1.33 minute. Finally add all durations together. To find out the combined amount of their howl times, you need only sum up what was calculated above because none overlap \u2013 this totals down to exactly one minute, ten and thirty six hundredths perse (or .133 when converted to decimal form), plus four minutes (.4), yielding a cumulative figure of about fifteen point three three mins ((total_seconds / 60)). Henceforth expressed it would look like below;   Total Duration = [(Duration_of Tobi)_seconds]/ [Minutes_per_second] + [(Duration_of Chiko)_Seconds]/[minutes/Second] + [(Duration_Of Igoe)_Seconds]/[mins/Sec]=((Tbi+Chiki)/{mn/sec}+Igni/{mn/sec})=(Total sec/(min/sec))=.to convert SecondsToMins use division rule thus Convertion method could also work if not familiar with conversion formulas    Final ",
