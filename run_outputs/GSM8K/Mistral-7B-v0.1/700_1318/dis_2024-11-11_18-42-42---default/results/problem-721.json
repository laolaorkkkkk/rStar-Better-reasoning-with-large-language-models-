To calculate the distance covered without accounting yet for arm elevation we divide the entire journey duration minus lifting arms part; thus it becomes [(total_time) \u2013(arm lift seconds/sec)*seconds] equalizing them results to 5mins\u2013[((5-(a))/(b))] . We simplify further as below:  ((Total Time)-[(Arms Raised Duration)/Tap Slow Speed])\u00d7 Tap Fast speed equals Distance Covered Non Arm Elevated portion i.e Total Distance Travelled=distance traveled non arm lifted+(arm raise)(slow speeds). Substituting values based off above calculations our equation ends up looking like this:(5\u2212(A)) \u00d7 FS+AS\u22c5FS=(TF)=Solving yields   Arms Raise Seconds (AR)+Seconds At Full Speeds (SF)^Times Multiplied By Full Times Per Minute (TS){{({{(5\u2212{{Fraction {{AF}}}})})} \\times {FL}}}={{Time Without AR}}{{\\frac{{LS \\times AS \\times SF}}}{{{STA}}\\times TMS}}}Remember solving any mathematical problem involves finding one thing first before moving onto another similar but different calculation later\u2014this principle applies here also so continue methodically until finally achieving your objective!

Helga\u2019s dance includes a duration of about 5 mins but raises her arm over partway through this time period i.e., around 2 min approximately so we need consider them separately as before and further conditions like speed change etc.. Here comes into play concept called workrate problem solving which requires you divide up periods based upon known rates(with limbs lifted vs without).

Thus , Helga\u2019d perform (2x5)+(.458^2*5) or ((2)(458))+(458^2)*(-(half)^2). Which means heliga performs 916+(458)-((25%)of this sum), thus performing around 1309. Therefore, the answer is : Approximately 1309. However we can find exact value also as follows:For first two mins,helga performed (both rates together)= {[(rrate )/(2)]+[lrate /2]}*{total time}= [{(300+250)/2}+{200}]*(2minutes)={(550}/2}{(750)}=(775*2 minutes)=1550 stepsIn last three mins.,with hand in air,sheperformed [(righthand alone ]+leftfootalone]=[({rafter})+(laferer)]*{time}==[{200}/2]*3{mintes}{steps}==300*.3{{meters}}==90stepsTotalsum:=firsttwo minutes'+lastthree minutes[:1550]+90=>about 1640",
