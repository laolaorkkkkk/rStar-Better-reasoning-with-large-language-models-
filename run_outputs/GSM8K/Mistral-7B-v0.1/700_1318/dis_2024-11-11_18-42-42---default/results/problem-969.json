Calculate the cost based upon quantity purchased minus any discount applied. Since only two out of these four phones get full priced ($600 per phone). Therefore, calculate this as follows: Total Cost= Full Price*Full Phones+(Half Price)*(Discount Phones)=$600*2+($600/2)*(Number_of_Phones-FirstTwo)-Total paid=$1200+$300*(Four-Two)$=.

Solving this equation results into (1200+900)=(total), yielding a value equal to $2100 as your resultant amount . Therefore ,the correct sentence would be : 'John paid $2100'. Let us express it using Python code as follows `first_phone=price=600`,`additional_phones=(numberOfPhones-2)*(price/2)`,where numberOfPhones here refers to the overall count including Johns own Phone and those he intended purchasing for others.. Thus we can replace variables within parentheses such as:`print((first_phone*2)+additional_phones)`which simplifies down to `(first_phone*2)+(numberOfPhones*(price/2))`. Replacing numerical values back makes our resulting expression become like `${result}=${price}*{firstPhoneCount}+(${numberOfPhones}-2)*\\frac{{$ {price}}}{2}` or equivalently `.replace(\"first_phone\",\"${price}\")\r",

Next, determine the discounted rates per item. Following this assumption about what counts under 'usual,' we know the other three phones would therefore come at half off; hence you divide $(600/2)*(number of items) resulting into [$300*(3)]=$900 saved because of reduced price due to promotions stated within context. Add up both amounts together : $1,200+$900 totals exactly ,and thus sums well .
