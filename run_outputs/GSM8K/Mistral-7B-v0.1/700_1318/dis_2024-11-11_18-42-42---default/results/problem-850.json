Hence subtract these from the original count on Farm Y which leaves us with;  45 - 20 = 25 Goats remaining in Farm Y. Finally add up all goats that remained over both Farms i.e., Total no of goats remaining= Remaining in FARM X+Remaining in FARM Y = 45 + 25 .

From Farmy Y, calculate double what was taken away (twice) so it would equal the amount removed which means you multiply one instance i.e., (1x) times 2 equals 10 times 2= 20. It leaves us with no calculation but simply subtracting this value from our original population within Famer Y because we know exactly how many individuals came out therefore; 45 minus these remaining ten leads me towards understanding I am looking for my resultant numbers here hence; 45(original numerosity)-10(outflow)= 35 remainders present currently .
