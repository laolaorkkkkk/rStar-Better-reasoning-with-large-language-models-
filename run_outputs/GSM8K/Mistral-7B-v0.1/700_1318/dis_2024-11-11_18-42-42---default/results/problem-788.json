Since John gets financial assistance equaling one fifth ('half') of initial expenditure, namely ($300/5) equals '$60'.

Thus, the remainder becomes : Total Fund Required \u2013 Current Money Available; ie.  \u21d2 Remainder Needed = Trips Cost - Currently Own Amount => Given Trip cost=$300 , John\u2019s own amounts=~$50 -> Calculate    =$300-$50=> We get ;                             \u21d2           \u2248$250 Still Missing .
