        " purple so you can set up your equation as r+w+p+(r/2)=total; since we know w=p(from eq),and R=(W+P) or (R=T/3). Plugging these values back into our original equation leads us to ((t/3)+((t)/3)+((t)/3))+(n*y)*2=t which simplifies down further leading to y*(2*r/(t/3)). By multiplying both sides through results in  2*r*n*yt*. Since n represents half of T divide everything else using .5 resulting in simply Ryx. With plugging numbers this lead to my final solution being just twice Y times X equals sixteen minus one pint because twelve divided across three sections would mean four paints per section therefore leaves ten not including y leaving eight if removed thus creating negative seven meaning only eleven remains.
