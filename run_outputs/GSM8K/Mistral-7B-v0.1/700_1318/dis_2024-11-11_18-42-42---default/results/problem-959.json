Summing together would yield T=C+M+U; namely, Total equals Consequent plus Multiplier minus Universe i. e.: T=C+(2)*(1)+[(2)*(1)]-(1)= C+2+(2)-1= C+3-.

To resolve such inconsistencies within mathematical operations when dealing exclusively with multiplication facts and basic arithmetic, I rely on strategies pertaining specifically to unitary constants rather than multiplicand factors themselves -- thereby allowing me assessments derived purely via direct computation without necessarily adhering strictly verbatim towards specific premise expressions dictated elsewhere : therefore employment methods involving summation procedures may well hold greater utility despite seemingly obfuscated derivations stemming thus far herein...but let 'd say something like..if s/he puts forth examples containing single digits whose value remain constant throughout entirety ..as opposed those having multiples components requiring careful consideration prior entry etc.--so considering these potential pitfalls along side any relevant constraints concerning algebraic manipulations ensures clarity moving forward!",
