Since single cases held forty five voluminous works adding yet anymore may turn into something quite bothersome unless alternative methods used subsequently prevent excessive readability issues arising within limited spaces thus solving our present predicament..

Dividing this amount equally amongst three groups would yield floor(110 / 55)=2, meaning we require only a single extra row consisting either mid upper combination i.e., [10+15] which totals to another 25 spaces used effectively requiring no further rows .

This means dividing the total collections by the capacity per unit i.e. \\( \\frac{110}{55} \\) results into exactly 2 cases needed since even partial cases aren't practical when dealing with physical objects like bookshelves .

Simplification requires knowing relative relationships rather than actual numbers but not absolute quantities or numerical multiplicity across similar units / items , i.e., determine if it needs calculating full scale data set versus deducing comparative ratios based purely upon relations mentioned within description text itself without overfitting details into equations just because specificity may appear 'more accurate'.
