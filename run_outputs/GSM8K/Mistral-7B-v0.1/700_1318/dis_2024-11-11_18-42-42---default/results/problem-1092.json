Further divide this figure by 2 again because Velociraptor took their share when leaving so we get around 100kg as midpoint but considering additional factors like leftover bones or other substances that aren't edible could make real initial value closer to the one mentioned here i.e., slightly lower than estimated earlier due to loss through non-digestion processes during predation stage making our estimate still somewhat higher. Therefore based upon these assumptions you might want your starting point near 'around ~$X'.
