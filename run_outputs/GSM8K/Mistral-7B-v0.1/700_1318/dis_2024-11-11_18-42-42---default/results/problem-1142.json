The answer is: 9.",
        " jellybeans. Green jellybeans plus red jellybeans make up 17+34=51 jellybeans. These together account for all but one color (blue), so it leaves only these last ones which would therefore just contain the blue jellybeans. Thus, if Jess counted altogether 60 jellybeans including those four colors mentioned before, this results into remaining count namely  60-(green)+(red) = Blue jelly beans , or alternatively also;      60 - [17+(34)] =>    blue =    19 . Hence we conclude that she could find out whether any other colour exists within our problem statement aside from three coloured jellies mentioned above, hence concluding otherwise since none was stated leading us towards such assumption based solution.
