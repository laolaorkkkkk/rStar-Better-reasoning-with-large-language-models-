We know one person wants several seats ordered together(one ticket per attraction) while others simply pay individually ($__-$___). This could possibly imply either three separate sittings purchased altogether OR four people watching simultaneously without additional fee charges involved since everyone goes along once & shares food too unless otherwise stated . Thus why those numbers look different when combined into single purchases versus separated ones because only certain conditions apply based off situation mentioned above such individual vs group visit rates etcetera within themself !
