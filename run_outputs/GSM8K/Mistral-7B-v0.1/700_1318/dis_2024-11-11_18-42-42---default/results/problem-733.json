        "$5. Thus, every person received $5 including himself, making it equal sharing amongst all who walked past him. Therefore, Each child got $5 when shared fairly but this amount was not asked initially so let\u2019s stick to what we need i.e., considering just Greg without any extra additions or subtractions as per initial question. When only focusing upon 'Greg', since no splitting involved here; therefore , the whole remaining sum ($20) is directly equated onto one individual (in our case, simply Gregory). Hence, Greg kept entire $20. However, if you interpret differently asking about '$amount_per_individual=total/numberOfIndividuals'- applying this methodology would lead us obtaining same results($5), hence providing consistent interpretation across different scenarios. Regardless, remember context matters while choosing applicable mathematical models! Based solely off original query statement \u2013 direct calculation provides result \u2018twenty bucks.\u2019 Don't overthink ;)  ",
        " ($20) evenly over all recipients (Greg himself plus three siblings): 5 per person because \\( \\frac{Total\\ Money}{Number\\ Of\\ Recipients} = \\frac{20}{4} = 5\\). Each of them receives 5 dollars when shared out equally; hence, every individual ends up having received one fifth (\\( \\frac{1}{5}\\))th portion as part of splitting twelve into equal segments (\\( \\frac{Original}{\\text{Amount Splitted}} \\) or \\(\\frac{20}{1}\\) divided by 4 equals",
        " So you divide what was received by those receiving so as no one receives less than anyone else or too little when compared to others. Since we divided into groups based on their age (i.e., adult vs children), these counts don\u2019t affect your division result if all members belong either directly under him (as older brother) OR indirectly under him only through shared family connection even though technically considered 'younger'. Hence considering solely financial distribution regardless relative seniority status amongst recipients \u2013 simply count individuals inclusive within beneficiary pool while allocating resources via arithmetic mean procedure; therefore dividing sum provided equitably across participants involved ensures equal share per entity present without regard otherwise towards other hierarchical determinants such chronological precedence possibly implied thereby implicitly suggested henceforth omitted intention hereunder stated explicitly thus avoiding potentially misleading interpretations regarding allocation logic used employed specifically applied presently observed circumstances described previously referenced subsequently mentioned briefly discussed forthwith elaborated upon later section below accordingly clarified further expounded comprehensive detail exhaustively outlined extensively summarily compiled concisely condensed finally succinctly synthesized thoroughly investigated deeply analyzed meticulously evaluated carefully examined closely scrutinized rigorously tested experimentally verified empirically substantiated factually confirmed theoretically modeled mathematically quantified numerically measured precisely estimated accurately predicted reliably forecasted sensibly deduced logically inferred rationally understood intuitively grasped conceptualize creatively innovate practically apply pragmatically implement effectively utilize efficiently operate adept skillfully perform competently collaboratively cooperatively cohesively coordinated harmoniously synchronized mutually interactive synergistically productively industrious vigilantly assiduously systematically strategically methodically tactically sequentially progressively continually iteratively perpetually sustained recurrent consistently regular routinely regularly routine uniformly standardized universally generally broadly widely intermittently sporadically occasionally episodically irregularly inconsistent haphazardly infrequently incidentally randomly temporarily transient momentarily permanently periodically habitually invariably always immediately instantly sooner earlier hastier swiftly swifter speedily faster rapidly accelerated quickened instantaneously expedited enhanced increased augmented magnified strengthened bolstered supported uplifted empowered reinforced propelled fortified supplemented boosted energized invigorated stimulated motivated inspired encouraged urged persu"
