Each 'free' occurrence results in watching only half their regular count regardless of usual schedule patterns or frequency distributions; calculate this average deviation per individual movie viewing session across those particular eventful Sundays while ignoring any standard deviations influenced through independent trials not related specifically to promotional influences mentioned above. To solve this problem, we need to consider three separate scenarios based on when the promotion could occur: it occurs twice (first time before first Saturday, second time right before last Saturday), thrice (anytime including both beginning & ending timespan), or nonexistent (the opposite scenario).
