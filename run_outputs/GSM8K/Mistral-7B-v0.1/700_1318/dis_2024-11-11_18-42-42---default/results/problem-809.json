        " says that he 'ended up selling 150', which means this quantity includes those initially thought as unsold (outside their expected timeframe). Compute remaining inventory prior to additional order based on initial stock minus sales performed so far. By deducting these quantities we get `100 \u2013 150`, yielding negative value indicating unavailability due overshooting actual starting count (`a deficit`). However realizing sale performance indicates active usage thereby reducing available supply hence correct deduction becomes `(initially intended) current_stock - already sold`. Here it amounts to `100\u2013(150%)` or `-(additional amount beyond expectation)`.
