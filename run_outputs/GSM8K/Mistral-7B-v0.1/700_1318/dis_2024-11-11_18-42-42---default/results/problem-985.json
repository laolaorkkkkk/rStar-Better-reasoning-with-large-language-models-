Let\u2019s identify any additional conditions like \u2018a week', meaning we need our previous results extrapolated out seven times because generally speaking one week equals multiple consecutive instances within it itself.)

        " which translates to (1/2)x(18). This means Edgar\u2019s brother eats [(1/2)*18] or [9], pretzels every day. Determine what it would look like if you expanded this into terms of time; since we need information about Edgar's broder over seven days multiply our quantity value times 7 because one occurrence equals per hour so here ((9*7)=63)). Therefore, according to my calculations based off your conditions mentioned above ,for seven consecutive hours (or rather days),the resultant equation can best be approximated as (number_of_pretzels consumed/time period=rate)) . Thus replacing specific numbers I obtain rate=(broders daily consumption)/days((9/7\u2248hourly)),which calculates out slightly under three preztelrs taken via intake methodually across said duration.(Rate<Prezzlers consumed when examined quantitatively against temporal expanse within confines supplied.)

Calculate daily intake over one week period Since it specifies 'a week', you multiply that daily rate by seven (\\(9 \\times 7\\)). Performing this multiplication yields 63. Consequently, if your friend takes only half or divides evenly into three parts among four friends equally sharing something, can I determine how many portions each person receives when six apples are available assuming no portion remains unsold without knowing any specific conditions like time frame within contextual constraints",
