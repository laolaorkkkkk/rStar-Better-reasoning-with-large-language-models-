        " delivered \u201c17 more than one-fifth\u201d the amount it brought on Monday\u2019s delivery. First calculate one fifth (or divide) which equals $\\frac{1}{5} \\times$ 425 or 85. We know this because dividing any whole quantity into equal parts yields quarters; thus having fractions such as halves ($\\frac{1}{2}$), thirds (${\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{3}}$) , fourths($$\\frac{1}{4}$$) . As we want just one part out of these four equally sized parts -- quarter -- our divisor would be $$\\frac{1}{4}$$. It also says \u2018one less,\u2019 therefore subtract eleven so you get $$85$$ minus ten resulting in seventy-five. Finally multiply seven by fifty \u2013 twelve yielding eight hundred sixty(i.e.,\u2009 $2\u00d7425=850$) plus fifteen \u2014 adding up to eighteen thirty-five (**$2\u00d717+17=$85$). This represents what was carried over to Friday. Calculate twenty times Eighteen\u2014sixty-nine thousand three hundred forty-two representing Thursdays letter count. Lastly combine all values together using addition thereby reaching Six Hundred Seventy One Point Three Four Two (+$+$+$$)-$Sixty Nine Thousand Three Hundred Forty Pound Twenty (=$$~75$$+$)$$85~~$+(Eight Sixty)+$(seven twel*)$ Fifty).

        " verbal descriptions into math problems (one fifth) which results in 85 ((425/5)). Add it together i.e., (85+17)=102 which means; They carried out delivery on Tuesday equals  102 Letters.(Post Office delivers lesser volumes daily). Post Offices carry their normal amount plus whatever condition set above It was stipulated ,they would pick up another quantity based off what we found earlier so multiplying this figure through(Tue= 1*Delivery)+ Friday\u2019s extra=(extra)*Delivery/(We already know Deliveries per Sunday)(Which totals Secondaries Delivery))(Wd.=((2*DayEpilogh)/FridaysExtra)-Because these come secondarily.)
