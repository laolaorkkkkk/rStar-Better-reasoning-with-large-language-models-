        " toy soldiers which forms one complete set or 'half'. Accordingly, if we divide it into halves as requested (since only full sets can form whole divisions), both halves contain the same amount \u2013 i.e., six toy soldiers each (that\u2019s what makes this situation \u2018fair'). This means three toy soldiers are valued at $5 while another seven ($5*3= \\$15) value higher. Thus, regrouping him back gets us $\\$2 \\times \\$5+\\$ 7 \\times \\$7$. Perform calculations accordingly yields a resultant sum. That results approximately equal to $2(5)+7(7)=10+49=59$. Therefore, following through these steps leads me to conclude Matthews could get around '$59.' The exact figure may differ based upon rounding practices but under normal circumstances our currency doesn't allow for such fractions beyond second decimal place hence approximations hold good here too providing greater practical utility than theoretical precision.
