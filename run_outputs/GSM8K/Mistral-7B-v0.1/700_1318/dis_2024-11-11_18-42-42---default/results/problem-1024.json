Lastly subtracting this sum twice as it was divided equally amongst her two elder sister who helped ($20), hence resulting into 320 \u2013 2*10 = $300 remaining balance. Thus, the solution could also state simply 'She kept all these amounts plus rewards.' However, following instruction strictly, we present only exact calculation sequence without additional details about reinvestment or expenditure patterns unless specified elsewhere explicitly within problem context like earlier examples here provided.

As per instructions we know no cost other than those needed for business activities, hence calculate net income based solely on revenue generated through sale transactions without deducting any operational or nonoperational expenditures like personal spending etc..

To further clarify why I used subtraction rather than addition here , let\u2019s go through simple terms without using math symbols ; consider starting point 'Succcesful Sales', if you spend part/portion away 'Expenses'. You simply compute remaining balance via taking Initial Success ('Total') less Money Spent Outwardly('Expenses'). Remember success not always directly proportional but interconnectedness often involves compensatory exchange processes involving tradeoff calculations based upon initial inputted values against consequential withdrawal actions made under pressure situations while still maintaining equilibrium stability parameters within predefined operational cost structures etc..

Hence it can be established without ambiguity; combined revenue collected over several months was worth ($80+$240) which totals up to (b). This amounts to $320 overall before deducting expenditures.. Consider subtracting any associated costs arising within this process such as ingredients needed or other miscellaneous outlays not covered herein including but limited to decorations etc...
