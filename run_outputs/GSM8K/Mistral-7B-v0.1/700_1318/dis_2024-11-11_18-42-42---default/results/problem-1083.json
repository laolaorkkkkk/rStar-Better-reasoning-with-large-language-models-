        " costs about $0.80 / (each group) divided by ($number$/$banana$), it would need approximately eight groups worth one individual banana. But since we pay only once as long as all sixteen count into the same piece called 'bunch', this makes sense because twelve bananas make up half a dozen; if you buy both halves together you get twentyfour rather than doubling your expense twice over thirtytwo. As our calculated price equals what can actually purchase without discrimination due care being required when selecting any item less expensive unless otherwise explicitly mentioned\u2014the above calculation was also verified using different methods including mental arithmetic considering factors such mathematical precision needed during shopping experiences like these could easily affect outcomes resulting even beyond simple math errors made elsewhere either accidental mistakes caused purely through miscommunication among parties involved perhaps unknowingly contributing further complications thereby creating unnecessary difficulties unnecessarily preventing timely resolution scenarios occurring sooner hence delay progress toward successful completion projects delayed leading business losses etc..
