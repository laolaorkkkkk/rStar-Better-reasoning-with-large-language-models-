This means you multiply $120 times .6 which equals $72 so we add those together and get $192. That\u2019s what James needs to spend every month because of his accident adjustments to standard price premiums. To find out how much this costs over a course of one full calendar year (of twelve months), simply take your new base value ($192)and multiple by twelve; therefore 192*12=twelve hundred forty eight.. Therefore the correct mathematical equation here would look like ((1+0.6)*$120)*(12)=((1.6)*$120)*(12)=($192)*(12). Finally multiplying across yields us our solution:$192x12=$2304/.
