        " makes (10*3)*$25= $750 every week. But if you want to figure it out once a month... It would take four weeks before getting back up onto one whole yearly cost ($4), therefore......So.....Annually he earns about(750x4) which equals 3000 Dollars!! Oh wait! His annual rent costs him just over($26/week). Which adds another few hundred to offset the initial investment . Of course this all depends upon whether or not those other people use gas too\u2026 And considering most modern vehicles run off electricity anyway; who needs fuel anymore ? What am I saying????? Let me explain further ;--!. Since we\u2019re only looking into simple math problems here let us keep our mind focused accordingly ;) ..and while keeping sight within ourselves what could possibly go wrong next :) ....but i digress ...so again assuming no additional expenses arise asidefrom normal maintenance fees etcetera \u2013-------> Thus finally answering exactly as requested \u201chowmuchprofitshe\u201dthus making things extremely easy FOR ALL PARTICULAR PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH THESE SIMILAR QUESTIONS : ) Thank You My dear friend !

        " three hours long this means you get $25/hr x 3 hr= $75 earned during one session (perhaps we can say it's called 'session'). But as all rentals happen every week so assumingly within these ten sessions or once a week till summiting up to ninety night worth $((90x$75)-($500))=$5625-$500=$5125 Total profit amount gained over months equals ((N*month)*((RentSessionEarnings) MonthTotalProfit)=[(10*1)(75)]*(Month Amount). As N represents whole no matter what type of value since rate cannot determine its exact values thus; therefore ,it would come off approximately equal to ; Profits Per year amounts roughly calculated into ($75 X ",
        " However, we also need to consider his car payments which amounts to $500 per month so when calculating profits ($750-$500), it equals $250.

Therefore, our options don't cover or provide possible correct answers based upon provided context and data set.*   ",
        " 3 hours. At $25 per hour, this equates to earning (10)(3)($25)=$750 every month. To find out what he makes annually subtract these amounts until you reach one year or multiply if it\u2019ll go past a whole year $(750)*(12 months)=$9000 over the course of a calendar year. However we need only consider rentals within those twelve months not beyond so just take first result which was earned six months before reaching next June because our question says \u201crental\u201d but leaves off exact date when asking about January thus considering only half as period considered would apply here hence sixth month being September ($450). We also know costs occur regardless whether sold since maintenance cannot wait till November due busyness reasons among them oil changes brakes replacement etc.. Total cost equals both periods combined=.$500+$500=$$. Next calculate profits=(earnings)-(expenses)$$-$(revenue+cost))-$$. Finally round up decimal points like normal things such calculating interest rate calculations using present value methods . Therefore answering part c above requires subtraction operation followed immediately succeeding addition operations resulting ultimately into numerical representation i.e.:c.(",

But since we only consider one yearly cycle here, let\u2019s calculate it again using just twelve months which makes us get ($750 * 12) / 12 =$750 as quarterly earnings not taking any loss into account during these events yet..
