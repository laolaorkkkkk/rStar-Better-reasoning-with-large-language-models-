However, she also finished finishing later which means those same opponents would deduct less time overall (as if taking away all or most of that earlier advantage) before being counted toward this specific metric; thus reducing any additional value gained since it doesn\u2019t matter whether someone gets fewer kills early because everyone else still hasn\u2019t even made up such losses anyway! Therefore we can see here again why timing plays quite significant role \u2013 especially during combat stages like Final Fantasy VII\u2018 s Sector Spread mission type ones etc., no doubt\u2013and therefore both players need proper knowledge behind timings alongside skills used within fighting scenes too unlike strategy genres perhaps\u2026 But back now about our first player/enemy counts\u2026let me explain further..if you take care only based off top down stats without factoring anything regarding either speed differences nor possible damage dealt per turn versus remaining health bars available under various types games systems.(Examples : TCG cards vs tabletop boardgame mechanics , RPG series vs casual puzzle apps.)Then yes sure enough numbers could easily become misleading due mainly cause human psychology makes people tend rely upon visible indicators rather comparing against average ratings themselves(i mean really?)so instead try calculating actual kill count values over entire duration intervals considering potential changes wrt stamina usage patterns among opposing sides besides general guidelines statedabove plus adding relevant bonuses obtained via completing optional objectives throughout battle areas accordingto difficulty settings appliedinto environment modifiers employedthrough different aspects linked togethervia certain formulasimplementationsduring particular scenarios involving multiplayer cooperationbasedsetup designswhich typically applyagainstvarious factionswithin single campaignmodevaryingtacticalplaystylesproviding unique advantagesaccordingyourpersonalspecificpreferencesfrom differencingchoicesetceterawhen interactinfailtypesuseduponopponentattacksincludingbothdirectdamageformethodssuchastealthreductioncalculatedusingcertainweightsalongsideindirectknockoutmethodsdeterminedthruothermathematicalapproachsonwardsendingturnresultsgivencontextofeachtypeforcriteriaassessedtherequirementsapplyableacrossallavailablemetricsrelatedtonumberstokepointscoreduepriorelvl1combatengagementskillsetsdisplayedbesidesbasiconesubmittingstatisticsontoanalysissoftwareorwebsitesfurnishingestimatesbackonlineatanytimewithout",

Henceforth, we also consider a negative reward due to finishing late \u2013 as all time wasting penalties applied equally across levels regardless if playing individually or collaboratively means it won\u2019t affect any player negatively.
