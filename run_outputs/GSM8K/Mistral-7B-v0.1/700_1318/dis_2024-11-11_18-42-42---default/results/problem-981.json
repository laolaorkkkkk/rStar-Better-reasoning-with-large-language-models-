Thus\u2026the desired value comes about quite easily without too much hassle ;-) To rephrase though:: First find summed quantity across individual instances occurring during weekdays (=addition symbolising combination & interconnection amongst events thereby representing cumulative effect); second work backwards via inverse operation applied towards overall figures thus yield \u2018original numeral / quotient obtained post subtraction procedure.\u2019 Third repeat identical logic until arriving back unto initial point\u2014this time around computing mean average rather than summation itself!
