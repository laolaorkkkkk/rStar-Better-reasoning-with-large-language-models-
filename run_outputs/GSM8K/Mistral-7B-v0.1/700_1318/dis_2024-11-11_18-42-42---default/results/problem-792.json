        " bottle caps. Each bottle cap gets him .25 or 25 cents as change back (this means it\u2019s still legal tender if you pay/give someone else). Because those coins don\u2019t all add up neatly into dollar bills, we need to divide our earnings by hundredths like this instead of whole numbers \u2013 which becomes pretty tedious but necessary when dealing specifically wih coin types rather than full denominations themselves; hence making math here look \u201ccrazy complicated\u201d :(. But since only decimals matter anyway\u2026 well let me know later once I finish my coffee! And remember guys everything comes out zero eventually because these things always equal themselves over time regardless whether their combined values appear different beforehand ;). Anyway ok go ahead first though just calculate what happens without doing anything weird until last moment otherwise results aren\u2019t accurate enough even assuming no rounding down during intermediary calculations:( ). Multiplying three figures together isn\u2019t hard either really mostly simple stuff yet sometimes requires extra work beyond normal methods used most places everywhere around earth due mainly owing lackadaisical practices adopted worldwide especially regarding converting currencies among countries whose national moneymakers prefer specific units per transaction such selling goods directly while keeping track simultaneously via spreadsheets made manually using paper forms filled repeatedly several times within same working week often daily basis thus adding additional complexity whenever possible increasing costs unnecessarily thereby hindering overall efficiency compared against typical industry standards applicable elsewhere(if present)(but not necessarily)which probably accounts partly towards current financial downturn problems faced globally resulting largely attributable partially ultimately purely accidental human errors occurring randomly throughout history leading us presently toward ever declining economic situation despite constant efforts aimed primarily reducing expenses across various sectors including banking related services offered online versus offline etc.. Thus unless proven false somehow future projections indicate continued trend growth unlikely reversibility therefore necessitating drastic action involving changes requiring substantial investments associated implementing new technologies potentially eliminated entirely altogether provided suitable alternatives exist currently unknown known however definitely available nonetheless considering long term implications affecting businesses large small medium corporate industries governement agencies citizens organizations individuals families households communities regions neighborhood city towns villages metropolises megacities cities countryside areas farms pastures grasslands hills mountains plains valleys swamps mangroves lakes rivers streams oceans coastlines coral reef islands volcano shores beach cliffs rocks peaks summ",
