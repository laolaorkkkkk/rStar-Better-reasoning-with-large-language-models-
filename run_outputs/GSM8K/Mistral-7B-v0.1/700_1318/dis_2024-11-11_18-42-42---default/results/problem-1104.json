Let\u2019s break it down further; since Ben is twice as old as Chris (who is 4), Ben would therefore be `4 * 2` which equals eight years old `(B=8)`. Since we know Carole's age depends directly on Ben's (`C=3* B`) , thus if you multiply ben's calculated value above into this relationship, Carol(c)= 3*(Ben) becomes c= 3*8 or twenty six.` Therefore, according to these calculations Carole is determined to be sixty-six ((C=26)). This verifies our reasoning process but doesn't change any underlying math principles applied during calculation. Thus 'the_answer', here signifying only one possible numerical correct solution based on provided conditions remains unchanged i.e., C stands true representing thirty-(two multiplied by Six)-three hundredths of decimal representation corresponding respectively translating numerically as seventy-four ('7','4') when converted accurately taking cognizance also over rounding errors might apply generally due predominantly dependent basis involved specific arithmetic computation method employed.'

To clarify this though remember multiplication orders matter while working mathematical operations so it was important here to first determine who was younger Ben(Chris) vs Caroline before carrying any calculations forward meaning when calculating I considered Christopher 's value but not their ratio against one another.(caroline <-ben<-chris thus ben& carnie -> chris.) Henceforth if your asked about christine' s relation compared to others use ratios/multiplications like you just used because relationships denote quantities rather relations signify positions! Finally finally once again let me repeat myself what im trying too get across even further due tommy sharpley comment : Do NOT make comparisons using phrases such\"twice\",\"THREE TIMES \",\"TEN FIFTEEN \".

Knowing this allows us to determine Caroline's age because if Carlosis three times bigger(which includes everything), so all together Caroline needs to be triple six which results 18years old.
