        " so we need to multiply this price per item (milkshake) by the quantity sold(Q). Q=6; P=$5.50 ; TxP=(6*5.50)=$33. Therefore Terries makes $33 when sales come solely through milk shakes!

Calculate these individually; Milkshake sales amount to 6 * 5.50=$33; Burger platter sales sum up to  9 *11= $99; Soda sales equal to 20*1.50=$30 Combine all totals together\u2014Total earnings come out as (Milkshakes)($33)+(Burger Platters)$99+(Sodas)$30 which equals ($33+$99+$30)= Total revenue of $162 . Hence ,the answer is : $162.",
        " This calculates as follows: Milkshakes earn him (6)*(5.5) = $33. Burger Platters bring in revenue calculated as (9)*(11)=$99. Soda sales amount to (20)*(.15)=$3 per sale or $3*. That totals all revenues ((33)+(99)+3=). Adding together these amounts results in $. Therefore, this brings us to our solution statement--that Terri\u2019s store makes $\\income$."
