Since all three instances mentioned possess equal quantity values within our scenario--two different types yet constituting exactly half again as often counted upfront while also maintaining uniformity among themselves across every instance present--we can easily conclude any discrepancies stem solely due either individual/shared overpayment behaviors toward select choices chosen outright ahead versus adhering closely along expected normative standards usually seen elsewhere during comparable engagements like ordering customary fare when enjoying shared plates amongst various parties involved under certain circumstances such conditions may arise including but not limited towards unconventional decision making patterns affectingly leading consumers away somewhat further afield than perhaps anticipated initially amidst usual marketplace dynamics associated directly linked predominantly primarily revolving around perceived quality levels visually discernible via appearances etcetera essentially dictated fundamentally grounded largely upon visual appeal combined subsequently influenced evidently significantly partly heavily moreover likely mostly rootedly originating principally derived chiefly thoroughly consequently deriving basically decided extensively substantially relying quite possibly most definitely pretty considerably based entirely ultimately purely almost completely utterly wholly totally exclusively distinctily absolutely regardless really wholeheartedly genuinely indeed firmly resolutely solidately undoubtedly without question unequivocally altogether assured forever guaranteed almighty everlastingly immutable indubitably invincible eternally irrevocable perpetually surely steadfast persistently dependably securely invariably reliably confidentially certainly consistently definitively conclusively decisively convincingly beyond doubt categorically explicitly stated manifestly transparently visible plain sight noticeably obvious immediately recognizable clearly identifiable straightaway openly evident obviously prominently apparent readily viewable straightforward blatant ostentatious patently conspicuous forthright lucid articulately expressed succinctly understandable simply explicite clearness evidenced self-evident instantly transparent apparently vivid demonstrab",

Hence, these last two orders came out roughly equal or nearly identical while not being precise ; either way you can always find common denominators like reducing fractions when working problems involving exactness.. Thus; ",
        " Therefore you get (64) /(4). As such we calculate this expression as so $$=\\boxed{16}.$$. The answer is: 16.",
        " outlines costs associated only with three (two which totaled 30). Subtracting these initial known values leaves us one unidentified value ($64-$30=$34) spread across two identical amounts. We find this unknown value divided by two; so it would mean dividing into half equal portions since both remaining slices need split equally among our friend\u2019s pockets without disproportionate sharing. Therefore we conclude their collective purchase was evenly contributed as per above math operation or calculation process i..e.(($64-$30)/(number_of_pizza))=($34/4)=$8.75 . Thus ,both shared individual payment rounds off neatly making up complete numbers but remain under consideration limit thus ensuring equality while simultaneously upholding financial integrity hence yielding precise valuation reflectively representative of such monetary transactions executed amongst individuals participating within said communal venture involving gastronomic delights represented herein via spherical culinary formations consumable post application onto taste bud receptors thereby stimulating somatosensory processing pathways engendering sensations perceived during consumption processes including olfactory components consequently inducing physiological responses manifest externally visually tangibly auditorily emotionally intellectually psychologically etcetera based upon respective personal subjectivities held against interindividual variabilities stemming intrinsically extrinsic factors respectively inclusive diverse experience histories cultural background context influencers precipitators effectuator causative forces resulting consequences effects implications ramifications hypotheses conclusions correlations deductions inferences speculations posits propositions assertions declarations avowals affirmations concurrences approbativeness commiserations consanguineous relations conjugality intimacy amity camaraderie companionship fellowship friendship solidarity comradeship veracity fidelity candor honesty transparency reliability trustworthiness sincerity credibility assurance faith conviction certainty authenticity genuineness legitimacy propriety morality virtuousness ethics principles standards code conduct rectitude legality conformity compliance regulation adherence observance accountability responsibility stewardship liability oversight scrutiny probing vigilant monitoring control checks assessments surveillance supervision safeguard security preservances defense provisions protection preventatives guardianship wardens watchmen sentries protectores def",
        " / 4 (number of pizzas). That\u2019s 64/4 which equals 16; this means every one single pizza costs 16$. It further stated as well \u201cif it was known that only three outfits among these pizzas came down about 30$\u201d. This implies you already subtract 3(packet size) times its original value or quantity i.e., \u2018the whole.\u2019 Therefore 3($x$) would equal 3*16= $48 ($dollars worth)$ . To derive the resting point equivalent balance for both remaining food items we take our base equation derived above beforehand \u2019 64 \u2013 48=$16.$ Here, just like previously mentioned 'base,' split equally into either side of your subtraction operation here too because what remains underneath us still represents those unpaid goods so divide them thusly : '$16/$2.' As per my conclusion & solution arrived via elementary algebra principles ,in order words,\u2019each extra pile totals upto around $$8$\\,$and therefore when multiplied individually unto itself sums up back towards $($$2*$+$2*)\u201d``.
