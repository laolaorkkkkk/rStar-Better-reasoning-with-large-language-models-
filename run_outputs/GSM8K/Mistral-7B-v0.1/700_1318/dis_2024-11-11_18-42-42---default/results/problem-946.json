Since this result represents \u2018fourty\u2019 more but here I misread instead let me correct my steps again starting from multiplying without error. Seven times Sam\u2019s count would indeed be 7 * 70, equalling 490, not just four hundred forty because multiplication directly corresponds to repeated addition \u2013 adding another group or units repeatedly based upon quantity indicated by scale factor(in this case \u201c7\u201d), leading us back to our original calculation mistake rectified henceforth following accurate mathematical logic.
