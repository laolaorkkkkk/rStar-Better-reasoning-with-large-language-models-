Since we want John\u2019s remaining quantity i.e., what remained after removing both Pete\u2019s as well as Patty\u2019s portions so if you subtract all those quantities i.e.: original stock \u2013 peter\u2018s share \u2013 patty \u2018s part therefore , resulting amount finally remains i.e..=12 \u2212\u20093\u22121=\u20098kg Hence , our desired output here henceforth becomes : Eight .

That means together Peter and Paul want about half so far -- roughly 8 kg combined. Since we can not split apples like this into fractions without considering smaller denominations \u2013 it seems likely these transactions involve dividing whole apples rather than halves; thus our initial calculation remains valid regardless if pears remain intact as units while consuming them both only once fully divisible among everyone involved!

        " wants based on their fractions; Peter gets one fourth (1/4) which would mean he takes up 1/4*12= 3 kg of apples while Paul takes three times as much than what peter took so it translates into taking up 1/3*12 = 4kg of apples since tripling means multiplying the quantity by 3 . To find out how many Kg of apple\u2019s remains we need calculate firstly whether the amount taken was lesser or greater comparing them to initial supply i.e compare amounts Taken ,i.e Total consumed \u2013 Remaining Amount initially present=(Together Both Wanted)+Total wanted(Initial Apples)-Remaining Initial Quantity Therefore adding all quantities together gives us :Sum Taken=.+Consumed By Two Boys===>(.+(.)-(())=- Sum Taken.=()===(-)=<Quantity Left>=().

        " so divide 12kg by 3 getting 4kg (since 'a quarter plus three thirds equals all'). This implies both peter and Pierre get together half or 6kg out of original amount which leaves us with remainder i.e., 12kg \u2013 6kg = 6kg remaining for Jacob as well because we only know about amounts taken already not who took what yet apart from pair combination including James but individually anyways let\u2019s assume everyone takes equal share considering just asked question hence this leftover would theoretically divided equally among them leaving none specifically alone without sharing evenly if needed further clarifications required still due lacking data here! ",
        " as mentioned earlier because he wanted less than what Peter requires. Therefore, Paul takes up (1/4) * 12 = 3 kg. Calculate combined consumption which equals sum of individual amounts. That would mean consuming all together; thus adding everything we get 4 + 3= <<4+3=7>>7 kg consumed altogether. Subtract this amount from the original quantity available i.e., subtracting those taken away from our starting point or base value, therefore going back into calculating leftovers. From initial purchase before any division among friends starts(which means just taking stock), you deduct whatever portion ends being utilized meaning if out of every start batch everyone decides who take part&how big piece go eat till none remains finally james having remaining untouchable fresh fruits like not changed yet no need anymore simply stating stayed unaffected while others took action leaving him still holding same amount minus nobody touched hence stay intact fully functional whole unit remain exactly mirror image compared pre meal vs during post sitting breakdown & restock stage. Hence using these steps calculate Joseph\u2019s share assuming initially allocated quantities per friend already assigned accordingly accounting only distribution impact considering nothing else but mere allocation without further implications affect change state stability maintain absolute balance ensuring everybody enjoys fairness enjoyment equanimity across board regardless personal preference bias etc resulting identical equilibrium evenly distributed equal shares amicably respectfully amongst participants equally rewarded despite difference demography age ethnic nationality religious sect gender status income education profession occupation family background economic circumstance geopolitical climate cultural norm political ideology social class societal structure organizational hierarchy power dynamics influence collective conscious awareness interpersonal relations communication skills empathy compassion understanding sympathy tolerance acceptance forgiveness mercy patience humility grace charisma charm popularity appeal attractivity likability magnetism draw attention desire demand supply scarcity abundance wealth prosperity happiness success failure defeat frustration anger aggression resentment jealousy envy competition cooperation collaboration compromise negotiation meditation mindfulness relaxation stress reduction anxiety management self esteem confidence body language speaking articulating clear concise expressively informative educator inspirer motivator leader teacher advocate supporter mentor guide encourager altruist philanthropist activist reformer visionary idealist innovator creativist artist inventor designer poet writer scholar scientist engineer researcher technician medical doctor nurse",
