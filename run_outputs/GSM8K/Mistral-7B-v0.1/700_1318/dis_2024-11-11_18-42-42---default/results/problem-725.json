Adding such numbers yields seven twentyeighths times ninety seconds instead eight parts worth seventeen fourths minutes divided equally into twelve intervals within four weeks plus ten months resulting back once again towards original duration calculated earlier but multiplied accordingly due less consumption speeding along so fast!

        " time required by both cat and dog together taking one piece (i.e., when combined) becomes 'x+y'. This happens since we don\u2019t see any mention made about them finishing it simultaneously as their efficiency differs based upon consumption rate or speed i.e., R=V/(T). Therefore according to this concept if V remains constant(they consume equal no.) T goes opposite way meaning lesser rp => higher r and vice versa. As per problem statement \u2018both dogs & cats consumes SAME NUMBER OF BODIES but not same INTELLIGENCE OR SPEED; thus \u201cEfficiency\u201d varies BETWEEN THEM WRT CARE AND ATTENTION ON CONSUMPTIVE PROCESS.'
