Therefore, if Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Carl\u2019s height therefore equals 5+1=6ft; so since the cane\u2019s length equaling him is called \u2018x', Carl\u2019s age could simply mean xx/2 which makes me get 'X'.

Therefore according to the third statement it follows logically that ned being smaller hence standing only  6ft_tall(because islanders who stand too high could never grow into lowbouncing ones like us). We also know this conclusion matches our first piece saying carl would therefore need to sit just beyond necks size which align nicely when considering another fact telling about carls unusually small head not able to support him without assistance due to its lightweight nature adding up roughly   5-inch heads .
