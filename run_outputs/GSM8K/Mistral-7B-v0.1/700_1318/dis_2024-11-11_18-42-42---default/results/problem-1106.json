Hence , every tiny millimeter bit comes out around 64 small units...that means if these little bits add up all together making them evenly spread throughout ...it would require just over double the original amount but not exactly half what was needed -- which makes sense considering everything else here since dividing both halves made very similar lengths). But still somewhat tricky! We also need our basic assumption set straight quickly because otherwise things might go sideways pretty soon--so before anything goes wrong let us note right away no such numbers actually exist when working directly forward within division itself (*ie.* without converting back first), therefore always make sure your calculations start simple enough :) It could easily cause confusion later down road once doing complicated math involving decimals etc like above....

Hence this means that each smaller portion comes out as half or .5x of original division point; therefore if our first segment was 25cm, dividing it results in segments measuring about .5*25 cm=.

        " which means Marty needs 100 / 4 = 25 cm per section before cutting them up further. Secondly, since these sections (now measuring exactly 25cm) themselves need to be equally subdivided again down into smaller lengths corresponding to their own division count value set as 'n', this would yield n*(25/n).

Therefore, if you multiply this 5 length times itself twice (since it was made up out of three prior sections), you get your overall smallest segment size -- since every section before gets broken down equally when making later small divisions.

Therefore, Marty can make fourteen equally sized smaller segments using this procedure; if rounded off as suggested earlier every single piece becomes around 5cm. However technically speaking, these small sections wouldn\u2019t exactly measure up precisely because when dealing with division results may not always yield whole numbers especially considering decimal points involved but rather approximate fractions. Without any additional information provided here it seems reasonable enough thus assuming all calculated figures being roughly accurate hence concluding 'approximately'. Final ",
        " Marty needs to make three further divisions (two per original piece) resulting in four small segments all measuring exactly one quarter meter or fifteen centimeters respectively. Therefore, each individual segment measures half of this length i.e., seven point five centimeters; hence it can also serve as our desired 'final' measurement hereafter referred to when speaking about those fourth order fractions produced upon dividing up these smaller segments evenly again among themselves while maintaining their relative proportions intact throughout said process(i.e without compromising any single element\u2019 s integrity).

Calculate further what one fifth (since it needs dividing equally) would measure; you divide again, this time taking only one out of four segments which amounts to calculating  25/4 or approximately 6.25 cm as every fourth division was made before considering them collectively. Thus, the overall size reduction when splitting these smaller sections results in around six point twenty five cm lengths obtained upon finishing all steps accordingly.
