Substituting F=33 into the above formula yields 33 = 2x + 8 or 2x = 33 - 8 which simplifies further to  2x = 25 . Solving for 'x', i.e., finding out Dora\u2019s current age would yield us : x = 25 / 2 equals approximately 12.5. But since human ages aren't counted in decimals it means you could not round off Dora's age down because if so when she was born; she still wouldn't actually exist hence let's just leave Dora aged as exactly what fractional value derived but rounded upwards thus making him one year older ;so effectively approximated at present , lets assume Dora being around 13 considering all factors involved while ignoring mathematical accuracy due caution applied here unlike normal routine calculations such issues typically arise during precise scientific computations involving time measurements across various temporal scales etc.. As mentioned earlier however assuming only these steps apply without resorting directly towards typical algebra solving methods used within standardized testing environments ensures less complicated numerical manipulations overall though admittedly somewhat imprecise sometimes even resulting potentially slightly greater discrepancies over extended periods under complex circumstances including variables like leapyear calendars causing occasional inconsistencies amongst differnt populations globally throughout Earth history despite their mutual adherence regarding core definitions relative cyclic intervals relating earth rotation against perceived celestial bodies orbit patterns irrespective whatever individualistic locality preferences might stem form those underlying principles observed universally everywhere regardless cultural specificities arising primarily through anthropogenic consideratiotions affectin mostly western societies originating mainly backgammon games associated indirectly via greek mythology influencing Roman culture subsequently impacting european thought trends ultimately propagating westward expansionist inclinations worldwide although similar themes having also appearred elsewhere particularly among prehispanic civilizations native american tribes inhabiting northwestern continental interiors extending toward eastern pacific ocean shores prior colonisation attempts undertaken whithout noticeable difference albeit possible variation owning distinct regional traditions reflective variations emerging historically wherever significant numbers existed maintaining coherent social structures enabling shared belief systems governing collective existence whilst pres",
