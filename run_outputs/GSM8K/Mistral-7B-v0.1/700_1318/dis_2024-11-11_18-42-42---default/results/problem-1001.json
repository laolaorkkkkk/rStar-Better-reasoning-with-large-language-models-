Subtract this sum (converted into hours which makes it around 2hours and 50minutes )from your desired serving hour i.e., starting off from 'serving hour'. That means if you want people over dinner who starts about say, let us assume here 8pm(it doesn't matter exactly because basically the idea I am trying to express only matters).So subtract approximately 2 hours and fifty mins leaving roughly enough gap upto maybe arounf 6 or so since timing might not be perfect most often but its always better late than never hah!

Cooling down requires not just one hour but also conversion into seconds which becomes `1*60` multiplied further again considering we need times required both ways hence resulting overall adding up around `(2+2)*60=2*120=240`, finally writing out explicitly leads us towards `frosting` getting rounded off till nearest multiple higher than `freezing/baking`, thereby forming equation like below.\r",

Therefore ,the task needs to begin no later than 1:30P.M if Jordans plan was correct according their schedule. However this result means starting too soon as well because most importantly once you calculate till when your preparation phase starts including mixinging the ingredients adding them one by another until things get mixed together etc.;it consumes even longer duration.

Hence we need not convert everything into seconds or add them up as per their occurrence sequence but instead find out when the last task finishes, which allows us knowing precisely our 'cut off point'. Thus: Cooling ends first since its duration is most extended i.e., 2 hrs= 2*60 min.=120 mins later, starting exactly right away means you wrap this around till about ~9:14 am . Baking starts immediately post mixing (at roughly noon) & takes half hr , wrapping round again until nearly  5:10pm... Icing commences simultaneously while cooker turns cold(say~5 p.m.)& completes within few moments....Thus serving just before dinner!
