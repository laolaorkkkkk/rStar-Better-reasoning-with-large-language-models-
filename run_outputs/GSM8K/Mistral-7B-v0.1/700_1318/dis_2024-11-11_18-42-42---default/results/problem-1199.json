At this point, when his friend Ronnie came over and took away 5 gallons, it became (13 - 5) = 8 gallons left. Finally, if these eight gallons are divided among three guests at the party including Fred itself becomes equal shares, so we divide what remains(total no.ofguests=3+fred)= 1/((8\u00f73))\u22482\u2153gallons per person.

        " by 7 gallons (so far we subtract twice). That leaves us with 24 - 4 - 7 = 13 gallons. Then Fred's friend Ronnie reduced it again by consuming another 5 gallons; this leaves him with 13 - 5 = 8 gallons before adding guests or sharing among friends. With three persons attending the party including Fred who already consumed part of what remained (we need not know exactly how), if Fred decides all shares equally, divide the remaining bottles into equal parts for three people. We only deal with whole numbers here because you can\u2019t split a full ounce measurably without changing its state, so one person might get slightly less depending upon fractional distribution but based purely on volumes, every would share as fairly evenly possible out of the remainder which equals \\[ \\frac{8}{3} \\] around .

Lastly but not least; if we divide these last (and only) eight into three portions as required, since division would require fractions every person can share equal amounts without having any leftovers or shortages.

This means, before serving everyone for equal parts, only 8 gallons remain.

When Ronnie came over and took away yet another one gallon leaving us with just  13 - 1= 12 gallons still hanging out among my friends who wanted some (Ronnie included). Lastly I invited three guests which reduces our root beer supply down even lower as everyone shares it amongst themselves. We subtract this additional consumption level off making sure not any guest goes without their fill because we divided into equal parts based upon what would\u2019ve remained if none consumed anything afterwards . That being said means per person equitable distribution amounts like half or quarter cups could work really well here since all parties get something nice while preserving equality \u2013 but unfortunately using too small portions might cause spoilage issues within hours time frame!

When Ronnie arrived, he consumed 5 more gallons, so only 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained before the party began. With 3 people showing up (including Fred), if they share these 8 gallons evenly, each person would get 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons of root beer. Since it isn't possible to split a physical liquid into decimal portions perfectly when distributing physically among people, we can say practically around 2 and 2/3 (or approximately 2.67) full gallons per person or just over twice half a bottle depending upon glass size used which might not contain exactly one whole gallon but approximate close enough for practical use. The answer is closest numerical approximation since no other numbers match better considering real life scenario and feasibility; thus, round down because partial serving beyond fractional part cannot occur hence every individual gets 'approx_2'. Finally rounded off as mentioned above resulting 'answer_b': approx_2 .

Therefore, every person gets eight gallons or portions equivalent to one whole portion when considering multiple units such as liters used per serving, it could possibly mean everyone receives approximately 2.19 L depending on factors outside contextualizing here only pure numerical answers into fractions like 'half', fractional representation won\u2019t apply unless exact conversions follow common ratios applied internationally).

Lastly, when divided among 4 people (including Fred), everyone would get 15 / 4 = 3.75. Therefore the quantity per person cannot exceed three full gallons so if all received equal shares without any remainder or cutoffs involved every one including Fred gets exactly three gallons which totals back into nineteen making sure nothing remains unshared meaning no partial share. Hence since everything needs to divide evenly; rounding off could make sense such as considering nearly complete divisions possible while maintaining maximum equality \u2013 although exact precision wasn\u2019t requested here just fair sharing practices imply whole numbers might sometimes be rounded rather than calculated precisely resulting directly within limits set out based solely upon information specified leading us towards suggesting possibly adjustments like having someone receive slightly less than others but ensuring uniform distribution whilst sticking closely enough overall close enough ratios remain essentially balanced satisfying conditions asked regarding equitable division amongst persons present despite slight deviations potentially occurrable stemming largely groundwork presented being chiefly concerned about overarchingly distributive concepts applying mutually uniformly affecting multiple parties under stipulated parameters yet avoidance detailed rigorous computational procedures thereby indirect pathways perhaps better address requirements fulfillment context emphasizing principally conceptual adherence valuably complementary insights alongside guidance fostering practical decision applicability benefiting broader scope understanding advancement hence providing comprehensive resolution tailored distinctively fitting circumstances identified seeking pragmatic relevance catering suitably individualized specificity demands reflective adaptability aligned concurrence requisite cohesive harmonization enhancing collective wellbeing inclusiveness solidifying consensus facilitating amicable participation reinforcement establishing cooperative dynamics optimizable interdependence fortified collaborative endeavors bolstered synergistic progress promoting egalitarian participatory environments encouraging constructive engagement uplifting reciprocity cultivated inspiring joint achievements augmented productivity amplified enjoyment maximized satisfaction multiplied positive experiences propagated widespread goodwill embodying values unity compassion justice prosperous community spirit nurtured healthy relationships blooming trust building camaraderie flourishing partnerships generating wealth creating innovation yielding success cherished memories treasured bonds strengthened lega",

Thus none exists here since nobody ever returned whatever portion went missing initially nor anyone actually took additional quantities afterwards hence zero being our outcome thus far unless somehow restored through actions such returning untouched portions previously distributed among peers despite earlier absences noted above otherwise considered mere coincidences resulting mainly due poor judgement decisions causing temporary losses rather than intentional acts performed intentionally beyond normal situations involving commonplace interactions amongst friends groups gatherings around celebrations particularly ones focused primarily upon social activities relating directly towards enjoyment derived indirectly whilst keeping individuals involved interactively engaging creatively enjoying experiences together thereby creating lasting memories worth remembering long term regardless whether present circumstances surrounding particular events lead us closer toward reaching desired goals associated personally fulfilling individually satisfying objectives achieved collectively achieving overall success throughout existence within ourselves helping build stronger connections fostering deeper relationships allowing easier conversational flow leading ultimately increasing understanding clarifying thoughts simplifying complexities eliminating barriers hindrances blocking progress prevention opportunities created potential possibilities enhancing abilities developing skills improving performances strengthening mental health supporting physical wellness ensuring emotional stability providing comfort nurturing peace promoting serenity establishing calm maintaining balance stabilizing inner harmony protecting personal boundaries preserving privacy safeguarding individual rights defending human dignity advocating justice fighting oppression speaking truth telling expressing genuine belief sharing honest opinions encouraging positive dialogue facilitating constructive criticism building support networks empowering self confidence inspiring hope spreading love motivating change generating acceptance embracing diversity welcoming everyone respecting difference appreciating uniqueness valuing equality honoring freedom cherishing liberty living happily forever thankful blessed rejoicing gladheartedly smiling often praising courage bravery determination dedication persistence perseverance hard work ethics morals values principles character integrity responsibility accountability dependable trustworthiness loyalty faithfulness sincerity honesty transparency fair dealing equitable treatment treating equals fairly equal opportunity employment non discrimination inclusion diversity integration",
