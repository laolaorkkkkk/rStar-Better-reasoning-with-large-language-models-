Subtract this quantity from the original number of pizzas available before consumption begins so you can find out the leftover amount once all groups finish consuming their portion; here it means subtracting what was used up i.e., remove these amounts only [since no specific instruction indicates subtraction], hence we get remaining_pizzas_gluehclub= 20-(20*7/10)=6.

It represents doubled value which implies multiplying something again or simply additive multiplication since order doesn\u2019t affect addition but not defined whether increase its size proportionately or just multiply altogether like if adding ten apples instead of tripling etc..

Remember our formulaic structure follows [{(club[a]+(multiple[b]*quantitiesforA)*eatsForB)}]/[(originalcluturesum)]=[remainder]. Substituting these variables yields [(greececluborders*(1-.7)+footballteamorders*(multiplesorces*totaldishes*.8))] / originalclustersum = remainder Let us substitute into equation set forth above using following equations resulting thus:[{(.2)(20)}{}+{.4}(40)](Remainer)=[[SumofClusterItems]]Since quantities per group or multiple value used was specified only as being equal let us assume uniform grouping size i.e., one item makes another unit whole ie.. 1 .

Sorry if it seemed confusing before. Actually let me break down your request again. Firstly, according to what you said initially both teams consumed all their pizzas too right ? That\u2019s not possible but I see why someone might misunderstand\u2026 Well here goes :Glee Club consumes or used up `((70/100)*(number_of_greeting))` i.e ((70/(100*(2)))).That leaves us `(remainder)=  2`Great !So ,Football Team orders doubled Gretchen order..i.e,(order_football=(total_initial) / initial_team)-used_gleeks`.This comes out to:`<FILL IN>`After Football eat its own share (`share`) we get remainder like so ..Remaining=`Total ordering\u2013used_from_first_club \u2013consumption`And hence our result would look something similar below \u2026.(after filling blanks)(final answer)```python Number representing whole Pizza count.= Initial Count \u00d7 Percentage\u00f7Whole value\u00d7Initial Value[Pizza]+Left overs\r",

Well here goes if i understand properly! It seems like everyone enjoys their own version so let me try another approach based off my understanding below maybe?. What follows I believe may clarify things further including what remained untouched because others might see these items differently than those present during consumption thus providing alternate results.. This way both teams can enjoy without any confusion due primarily caused by incorrect interpretation within our initial discussion above itself especially when dealing only w/ numerical values while completely omitting relevant physical entities responsible regarding ultimate distributional changes applied across all involved categories post said events .. And therefore , one could propose considering either individually examining per entity group rather simultaneously grouped thereby preserving context specific detail needed effectively answering desired inquiry ; albeit somewhat complex calculation process required perhaps\u2026 But still worth trying right ?

        " but only kept aside (or didn\u2019t eat) their portion so it means when calculating what remains you need not take away anything since this calculation refers solely to those remaining among all orders placed thus far meaning nothing gets deducted here hence leaving us still having the first order; thereby resulting into your initial stockpile being maintained despite said consumption yet ensuring its survival over time regardless! Similarly applying these rules helps one understand better why reducing food intake could help preserve weight especially during dieting regimes while allowing unused portions stay fresh longer providing easier replenishment options downstream later requiring less prep work etc.. Thus answering using similar logic applies equally whether dealing specifically just about individual items or regarding entire assortment combined would simply reflect different proportions depending directly upon specific percentage values involved ultimately determining correct figures respectively accordingly consequently proving useful within broader general contextual frameworks too .
