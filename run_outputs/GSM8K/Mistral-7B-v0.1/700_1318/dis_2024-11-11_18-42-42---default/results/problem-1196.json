        " the quantity of black pens (i.e., Number_of_black_pens = Red_Pen_Count * 2). Calculate Total pen count based upon their color categories Add all quantities together as this equation shows Pen_count=Red_pen_pack*Quantity_per_red_+Black_pen_count+Quantity_Per_black_. Hence we get Pen_count=(Number_of_Red_Packs* Quantity per Pack) ((Number_of_Red_Packs*(Number_in_each)_package)+(Twice _the_Number_of_Red_Pens)(Numbers_In_Each_Package)). Thus,(Pen_Count)=((Number_of_Red_Packs)*(Quantities_In_Each))+(2\u00d7(number_of_red_packages)\u2217(quantity_in_each)), which makes our formula equal to:(23 Pens)=[(5 \u00d7 5)] [{(5\u00d72)}].

Therefore substituting actual values results in:[Pen Count]=[(Fifteen)]([(Qty Of Black Pens Buy])).
