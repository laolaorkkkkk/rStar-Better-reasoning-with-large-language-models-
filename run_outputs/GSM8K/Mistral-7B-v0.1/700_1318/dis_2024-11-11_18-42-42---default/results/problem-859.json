To find out exactly how much Julieta earned subtracting the calculated decrease ($80) from Rafaela\u2019s earnings which resulted in $(800-$80)=$720 .

        " would be calculated by multiplying the number of customers (40) times the value of one tip ($20). Therefore, this can be represented mathematically as follows: Total Tips = Number_of_customers \u00d7 Value_of_one_tip= ??? Let\u2019s solve it together: We know that Number_of_Customers= 40 And we also know that Value_of_One_Tip= $20 Plugging these values back in our equation for Total Tips we get :Total_Tips$ =  40 Customers $\\times\\ \\$20 /\\text{customer}$(since \u201cper\u201d means divided by or /), so let us carry out multiplication first according the BODMAS rule followed upward calculation hereafter:$Total\\ \\$\\ =\\ (\\$)(\\$40)(20)$ which yields,$Total\\ \\$\\ =\\ -\\$$800 But since having negative dollar amounts doesn\u2019t make sense while calculating physical real world tasks like such ones ,we just take positive part only.$So,\\$, thus,\\**Rafaela*got*\\total\\_tips*\\$\\ = +\\$800\\. **Now let\u2019s move forward finding figure associated along with***Julieta*.****As per problem statement,Julietta gets 10\\% Less Money Than Rafaelella From Their Employees As Per Problem Statement .We already found That \\[\\underbrace{\\Large=\\}_{} RF =+\\ $800\\] Here R denotes Rafaela whereas F denoted Fernando because generally person letters written alphabetical order.<->Similarly J represents Julietta Also note that both people works same place i.e., restaurants Where People comes To Dine At Hence Equality Between Both Would Make Sense.$$Placing Our Values\\;Inside\\;Equation:\\;\\;Janet\\;Would\\;Get\\;Equal \\;to=-\\frac{1}{10}\\$(Since\\%;\\,Means)\\,%=.1And:-\\\\MultiplyingBothSideOfEqvationsToSolvedItForMoreClarity,-J=\\$=(-\\dfrac{1}{10})(-800)\\\\=-j=-(-\\$;)=+\\$80 \\\\Thus,\\**the figerure obtained regarding ***\u201c\u2018Judietal Earnings\" was +\\$80^\u2020$[Note:{\u2217Although Sign Of Negative"
