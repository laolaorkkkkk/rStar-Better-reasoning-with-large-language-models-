The problem says she uses 3 boxes containing 5 fires prints apiece which yields another 3 boxes * 5 fires prts/boxes =<<3*5=15>>15 personal fires prts . Add together these quantities to find the sum displayed or viewed by Hannah overall during this event. 120 displays seen directly through living quarters + 15 fired personally = 120 + 15 = 135 total displays observed due to either source within sight lines.

        " means the city puts up 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks altogether. However, Hannah can only see 40% of these, so we calculate 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks which represents what she sees overlooking part of the parade or setting within viewable range. Therefore if you add those together it would equal 15 (in yard) + 120 (visible portion), making a total of 15+120=135. The answer is: 135.",

Next, identify the percentage of these fireworks visible from Hannah\u2019s home which is stated as 40%. To find out what this represents we multiply it against the total display calculated previously i.e., .4(Fireworks_display). This comes up to (.4)(300), resulting into seeing about 120 Fireworks. Remembering addition because according to the question, there would still be personal contribution or usage involved here; add those additional ones made using 3 sets bearing within itself three bottles all containing exactly five lights inside \u2013\u2013that totals another fifteen candies [(Number_of_sets\u200a*\u200a Number_per_set)=\u2009Total]. We calculate both results ((total visibility)*percentage)+personal use=the overall amount seen when combining together viewership plus setting one aside while enjoying them privately[(visibility]+private enjoyment ). Thus ,this expression cancels downto :\u00a0((number_of_bottles\u00d7amount_in_each)/100+additional count).

Besides those visualized over the sightline provided by one dwelling, another part comes from within private properties such as home yard; here we understand Hannah intends further augmentation through personal contribution.
