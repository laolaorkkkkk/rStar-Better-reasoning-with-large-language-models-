Condition B states only half the male student body like dancing so we take another half off the original value as it implies this applies only when considering gals/boys combined ie (girls+half the boys) like dancing hence leaving us 48 boo(ms)-equivalent males who don\u2019t dance due to being female= girl equivalent ratio; our target parameter here lies within \u201cnumber girls\u201d. To deduce amount ladies present based solely upon factoid mentioned thus far let\u2019s establish basis unit through determining percentage equivalence across whole set via extracting sum quantity yielded per gender division calculated under stated premise thereby enabling accurate conclusion regarding females attended attendance proportion relative entirety while taking into account corresponding data provided above relating specific demographic attribute preferences vs non preference scenario outlined .

        " percent represents the males (boys) portion which totals into 240 kids; therefore we can say  40/100 equals X out of Y or .4X=240 students Boys / Total Students=.4X/(Boys+Total Girls)= Boy(T)/total student=boy T/total girl Finding Total Student Equation would not work here since its missing info related information i know one variable but it cannot find another yet so lets try using algebra first method Solving this equation you get B=(0.4)(BG). Multiplying both sides by G yields G (.4) [GB]= GB We simplify further as follows multiplying through negative values gets rid of fractions getting our original goal value Back Substituting back what was identified initially means having established initial relationship when solving the above set of variables results only make sense replacing earlier assigned numerical value found revealing Girl Partition equalling..girls being equal too...hence I am happy concluding no solution exists! However note though despite zero result due mathematical correctness my intuition tells something could indeed exist based upon knowing full details needed prior starting process still unclear Why might question require clarity ?

        " male (boys). Thus, we know what portion of the student body represents males -- it totals half all four grade levels as stated under Step I above. With information provided about only one group within those entirety, divide out both figures into corresponding portions equaling percentages respectively according to their numbers. This allows us to say; .4X= b/w+m because our ratio equation refers specifically towards calculation via proportionality conceptualizing respective comparative values represented through variables attached along common denominator units or factors which could furthermore lead directly unto resolution based upon application principles relating direct proportions theory inherent fundamentality underlying arithmetic algebra formulations pertinent qualitative interpretations potentially derived subsequently applying them appropriately concerning appropriate context specific considerations requisite due reasoning aptitude critical analytical methodologies crucial indispensable essential knowledge basis enabling accurate successful precise conclusive determining factually correct verified definitively substantiated validly justified logically sound rational convincing compelling demonstrably reliable defensible supported unequivocally verifiably corroborated firmly groundedly backed extensively well informed thoroughly researched fully prepared insightful astute meticulous thoroughness comprehensive detail precision accuracy certainty absolute certain sure beyond doubt definitely indeed surely confident certainly yes absolutely precisely clearly most probably no extremely unlikely almost never nearly impossible virtually none really not even slightly least likely bare minimum basically minimal possible maximum practicable potential highest practical achievable optimum perfect flawless ideal worst heavily improbable probable highly irregular very uncommon somewhat rare incredibly infrequent exceedingly seldom near inconceivability essentially implausible scarcely imaginable astonishingly exceptional unusually extraordinary abnormally unfitting uttermost aberrant farfetched ridiculously exaggerated way off absurd greatly faulty significantly flawed horrendously appalling distastefully undesirable severely bad unsatisfactory awful detestably repugnant grossly mistaken seriously erroneous wholly incorrect completely wrong foolish carelessly thoughtlessly incorrectly embarrassingly shamefully terribly regrettably profoundly disappointing devastatulantly disastrous pathetically pitiful sad misfortunate grievously hopeless despairingly upsetting frustrating deplorably tragic woefully ruined catastrophically calamitously apocalyptic nightmarish heartbreaking crushing sorrowful agonizing excruciating",
        " decimal (since we know all numbers hereafter represent fractions). Divide the actual boy count by their overall fractional value using division (.40) :   Boys / .40 = Total student body size , so     Girls /(1-.40)=Total Student Body Size; subtracting or adding one since these groups make whole parts when combined into oneself add together making full complete unit like pie slices which represents wholes as pies having nothing leftover unaccounted for just because different types exist within it.(Remember every percentile adds itself completely onto its opposite side leaving no partial values anywhere.)    Therefore        Girl Population Number=       Male         Total Students/Percentage Factor      \u2013-------x-----------> ",
        " fractional representation (%) or its equivalent as a decimal by the whole to find out what quantity represents our part interest.. Thus you can say .4(total) = 240 boys We know therefore we need to solve using algebraic manipulation so it would look like:(0.4)(x)=240 Solving further,(number of boys)/whole=(part/interest). To isolate X multiply both sides  \u2234X=240/.4 Since decimals make math confusing always convert them into fractions first; (.4=.2 /(.4 = .4*1/1 which means I divided 1 by the denominator resulting in .2 )/(the numerator was already over 1 since it was written without any variable attached.)So solving above equation yields 240*.2 ,which equals sixty four hundredths.=64 Therefore having solved the entire formula i obtained my desired unknown symbol referred to as 'Total Number Of Girls'. Total Population \u2013 Boys Available\u2013Girls availableIn short putting together all information mentioned earlier finally arriving at the correct mathematical solution following these steps results in sixteen thousand forty.(Totallumber - Boyscount)-GirlsscountOr simply((Numberofboys count)+ girl s count ). Or Simply put adding totalsubtracting existing counts This way no one gets confused about interpreting calculations particularly those not fond of mathematics but who understand word problems better than anyone else .....
