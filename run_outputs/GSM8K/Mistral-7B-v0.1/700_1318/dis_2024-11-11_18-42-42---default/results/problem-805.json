Replace dollar sign since its just representing values here (${Diamond Cost} ). .$ {Premium Percentage}(decimal)=   Expand expression inside parentheses first according to BODMAS rule i.e order of operations. This implies multiplication before addition which results into ${ Dollar Value}. Simplify further based on what you already know about percentages.. To calculate percentage increase we multiply initial value by the ratio expressed as decimal form. Decrease means subtracting away so when calculating decrease like if something decreased twenty five % because remember thirty is one hundred minus seventyfive ten out of twelve equal fifteen per cent... We use subtraction rather dividing numbers up equally among multiple parts making them smaller proportions hence reduction occurs causing overall down size adjustment due tothe negative change represented numerically through division symbolized below ; %.

        " It also mentions the gold costing another $300; therefore both items together would cost $600+$300=<<600+300=900>>900 prior to markup. Calculate the additional value due to the craftsmanship (the mark up) as follows: $900*30/100=$270 This amount represents the increase over what was paid initially ($600 & $300), or this sum indicates extra payment which can only serve one purpose...in addition! Therefore adding them amounts so you find out how much James spent altogether before considering any other miscellaneous charges not mentioned in the question itself we get the following result:$600+$300+$270=(revised initial material expense)=$1170 ",

Substitute %.=$30$, $.${900}$simplify yield.${(.}*{)}{}{}$. Multiply the parentheses containing decimal places first,(.)*({}))result((.).{$}{}$,then multiplying both sets multiply their respective values result becomes ${{.}}{}.=${}Result:$378 dollaramount James paid forthe jewelry ",
        " sum ($900) by the premium percentage (30%). Calculate this as follows: .30(.($600+$300)). This simplifies to: .30($.900). Therefore, James paid $.30*.$900 or a grand total of $270 plus the original price minus what was saved due to discounting the product via premiums. Thus your subtotal comes out to about $1083 before taxes. To determine what you spent we subtract our initial costs: $1083-$900=$183 extra! That\u2019s quite a bit less than most people would expect upon reading those numbers only because all jewelry stores offer \u201cbuy one get another\u201d deals; meaning if someone purchases over X amount like here above its worth taking advantage every opportunity possible.. Our example scenario seems fairly realistic so let us assume no such promotions apply since nobody really wants double rings anytime soon\u2026 but sometimes special circumstances call them otherwise anyway ;) Finally , however when asked directly \u201dHow Much Did You Pay?\u201d my best estimate considering everything mentioned thus far turns into ~$225 based mainly off research conducted within hours prior publication\u2013though additional calculations may yield different results according too individual preferences while shopping per usual :) Cheers everybody ! Hope I could help clarify things down below ^_~ Enjoy exploring further yourself \u2019cause learning never ends :D Bye/Till Next Post Thanks Lot Again ;-) Randy Cobb Jaxxo & @wizardofozz "
