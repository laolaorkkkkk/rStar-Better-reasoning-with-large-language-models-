Each case contains several bottles but since no exact count was mentioned let\u2019s assume one standardized case containing around \u2018X\u2019 bottles. Thus having calculated individual prices; if Cognac charges 50% more i.e., $(C*6)/(2)=$6+$C [Since Scotch Price Per Bottle=$6] , solve this equation above equals X[unknown], find out Value_of_(Scotch+cognac). Which calculator or software tool used could determine values when numbers become so large without rounding off manually while maintaining precision accuracy?.
