Hopefully soon others may learn lessons regarding etiquette etc surrounding game rules regulations ensuring fair enjoyment across generational lines thus making experience smoother together than alone sometimes ;-) But again thank YOU guys folks providing info shared previously (: Enjoy playing though!!! :-D Cheers fellow members ~~~~ Edits :::: Editing mode ended ^_^ LOL EDIT :p Expected result:$2+($0*4)=$1+$2=$3 ($3 remaining). Total expected revenue(including profits)? Well obviously no profit was gained due lack proper planning ahead despite obvious shortcomings made evident via simple math calculation process demonstrated during previous example...but still important consider 'cause ignorant mistakes tend occur quite easily even moreso among newbies like yourself:) Anyways hopefully understanding overall concept explained briefly shall serve purpose better vs repeating unnecessarily similar comments seen elsewhere causing confusion rather clarity needed instead thanks(: Dear readers My apologies once again having taken things further beyond necessity intended initially thereby confusing somewhat clearer approach suggested lastly requiring additional explanation required priorhand knowledge necessary including relevant points mentioned concerning both scenarios provided early discussion thread contextually appropriate reference materials possibly offering insight upon topic covered effectively utilizing various methods discussed later alongside demonstration illustrations useful towards solving stated problems potentially resulting improved comprehension desired outcome subsequently enhancing awareness pertinent factors significant effect yield specific circumstances identified specifically question addressed raised particularly prompting responses elicited accordingly encouragement received whilst striving continue provide accurate information accurately convey messages intend express clearly understood concepts presented clarify unclear aspect arising misunderstand assumptions basis assumption incorrect interpretation leading wrong conclusion derived",
        " if applicable within calling duration timeframe (less than or equal) according to rules. It says 'after 16', so any calls made beyond this first portion count towards our next calculation using different rates. Therefore calculate only remaining part i.e.,  36 \u2013 16=money spent before rate change occurs m_beforeRateChangeHere; thus amount calculated under old pricing structure.(callDurationTimeBeyondPriceDropRule).

        " $0.2 per minute after 16 minutes. Calculate any additional charges beyond this period because we can apply the discount rate only when it happens according to the provided timeframe. Since our intended duration (i.e., calling length) exceeds the limit threshold as mentioned above ($16$ mins.), determine if extra payment applies over these limits; thus considering whether or not charge adjustment occurs during calls longer than what was outlined using information gathered within context clues about pricing strategy changeups past stipulated durations. Hence conclude no changes happen unless stated explicitly henceforth applying uniformity till reaching expiry point specified otherwise being nonexistent herein scenario laid before subject matter exploration phase initiated immediately upon introduction prompt sequence unraveling process progressively commencing proceedings accordingly pursuing accurate calculation results aimed toward satisfying requisite criteria thereby achieving desired endpoint outcome achievement status validation confirmation acquisition subsequently concluding analysis progression continuance forthwith completion marker reached therefore deem absolute termination post immediate action undertaken ensuring optimal effectiveness achieved fulfillment satisfaction ensuing result delivery realization execution culmination successful fruition attained state celebratory acknowledgment reception bestowed universal concurrence affirmative approval expressed universality wide acceptance collective consensus embracement broad spectrum assent acclaim accord comprehensive concordant unity harmonious resolution recognition full understanding certainty confidence faith verification trust reliability solidified bonds secured strengthened relationships nurtured growth potential realized shared success multiplied benefits exchanged reciprocal gains derived cooperative synergy collaborative effort joint accomplishments cumulative productivity optimized output efficiency maximized performance delivered value accomplished milestones celebrated victories relished triumph rejoice victory share joy happiness cheerfulness excitement elation euphoria ecstasy bliss delight pleasure contentment glad heart warm affection friendly neighborly kindness generosity goodwill benevolence charitable spirit altruism caritas compassion patience tolerance empathy sympathy concern love patient listen active hearing listening attention focus concentration concentrate deliberate reflect introspect meditate deep thought contemplation prayer inspiration motivation drive ambition determination dedication hard work diligence careful precision craftsmanship artistry technique skill proficiency mastery expertise knowledge wisdom experience learning lessons life teaching mentor guidance counsel direction purpose mission goal vision dream aspire realize potential actualize capabilities leverage advantage explo",
