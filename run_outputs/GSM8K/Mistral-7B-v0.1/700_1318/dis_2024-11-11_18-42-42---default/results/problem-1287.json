We also know three sisters who are both 16; therefore together they add up to 3 x 16 = 48. Adding everything together yields us a result of 48 (all sisters combined) + 36 (the two brothers), so a grand total of 84 years among them when you group them as either boy or girls rather than just counting individual numbers because generally people refer back totals like this instead of cumulative count individually without contextual grouping since those kind of calculations might seem confusing due its repetitive figures overlapping within groups/categorical classifications . Therefore if considering individuals separately would yield something very different while accounting pairs etc., thus why not include such details explicitly even though technically feasible too based upon understanding personal relations better through direct association but mostly avoided out of preference convenience & clarity purpose wise unless necessary specific situations demand otherwise especially involving complex familial hierarchies potentially causing distortions affecting numerical accuracy negatively thereby possibly misinterpreting intended intents behind queries hence preferring alternative options whenever possible keeping cognizance towards maintainin general simplicity alongside precise calculation results according common sense practical logic applied across majority scenarios typically encountered routinely daily life existential experiences albeit varying slightly occasionally depending largely influenced primarily via unique circumstances present during any particular situation arising under influence surrounding dynamics shaping respective interpretations accordingly differing perceptively amongst various parties involved particularly subjective perspectives impacting views held distinctly apart despite aim striving identical overall cohesion unitary goal achieved collectively sharing congruent mutually reinforcing cooperation ensuring stability sustainable progress harmonized balance equitable prosperity flourishing unity diverse inclusion fostered integration encouragement dialogue exchange constructive critical analysis collaboration teamwork synergy innovation entrepreneurship leadership guidance mentorship empowerment support self reliance initiative development autonomy independence responsibility freedom integrity honesty fairness justice equality respect rights dignity honor culture diversity inclusivity representation voice advocacy activism solidarity community fellowships friend networks associations clubs organizations societies fraternities sororities student unions athletic leagues halls churches temples mosques places offering solace gatherings celebrations festivals events ceremonies traditions customs rituals",

Total children including them was stated before therefore removing themselves takes out  16+16+old brother without accounting mother yet so subtract them thus : 48-(younger)(older)-(daughters)=mother's present age . Mom currently seems like being exactly middle among kids ages adding back herself ; hence average kin makes overall equally divisible over its length making parent aged median..

        " so that makes him 24 years old. Two other brothers could potentially vary but since no information about them was provided let us assume their ages also as per oldest known being equal (to make it simpler). Hence assuming both remaining brothers together summed up equals 2*12=24years .Now adding everything; 3 sisters aged collectively yielding (3*16) or 48 ,the one younger brother contributing exactly 12 ,and lastly  our presumed set of twin brothers sharing another 24collective ; Total comes out to be :  48+12+24=84    But remember this only holds if we suppose that twins hold identical age else result may alter based on differing individual factors..So without exact details regarding additional distinctiveness among triplets its safer estimate under mentioned assumption yet remains subject too varying actualities sans specificity detailing upon dissimilar aging progress amongst kin groups ..",
        " other two younger brothers knowing their ages add up with the elder (we know only that together they\u2019re not as numerous as or even just equal to Sister Count): Eldest Brother=Age+Brothers_Count; Subtract this value once it matches neither criteria so we can exclude either Brothers Together > Sis_count OR Not Even numbers but also greater than Bros count) We get Age+(Bros together excluding eldest)=<Subtraction result>=(Elder)+(Younger); Exclusive if >= Sister Count/>= Sister Total). As both results need to meet criteria none of them fit into second calculation therefore oldest Brother aged 24 fits our rules!
