Instead let us assume that only those three different kinds existed before consumption so here goes : assuming just four original varieties , if kira purchased  3 units apiece corresponding respectively with categories denoted above ; consequently having acquired thusly exactly twelve respective entities prior; minus finally whatever quantity consumed equals ultimately what precisely remains untouched ?
