        " According to the question it stated, the dentist drilled (or removed) four of those thirty original teeth . We need this information because we can deduce if someone gets their teeth capped ,they usually cannot take any further action upon them . Therefore identifying exactly which ones get treated first becomes necessary when solving problems like these.. However since here instead counting just one set as \u201dtoothless\u201d(i mean only temporarily till full recovery happens),it simplifies things tremendously! This means before proceeding lets remove all possible cases involving partial removal or non functional removals such instances being handled already separately later alongwith similar treatments applied accordingly elsefor every complete single treatment procedure carried out results directly into either whole restoration scenario within limits allowed currently available methods followed generally accepted internationally thus making calculations required straight forward except perhaps small corrections made due individual variables takeninto account depending mainly mostly largely most probably based purely statistically not individually yet still having minimum margin errors involved even though very rare events occur occasionally during overall process especially considering wide variety among various populations worldwide .. Nevertheless keeping above mentioned concept clear enables us easily visualizing our situation regarding calculating percentages correctly without confusing ourselves unnecessarily while performing complex math operations needed whenever dealing mathematically precise quantities representing real life situations happening often times requiring high accuracy numerical values calculated precisely according specific formulae used frequently employed throughout history scientifically proven universally practical applications commonly practiced globally including healthcare fields widely regarded efficient albeit somewhat controversially debated aspects relating specifically medicine related subjects particularly concerning issues surrounding human race intervention towards its wellbeing improvement efforts nevertheless promoting collectively strives toward better understanding together creating harmonious coexistence aiming achieve holistic integration leading eventually resulting enhanced quality standards across diverse geographical locations spanning continents entire oceans providing optimum potential benefits ultimately ensuring comprehensive satisfaction thereby prevent negative consequences arising consequently affect individuals themselves irrespective ethnic origins belief systems customary traditions etcetera owing sole responsibilities inherent unique characteristics possessed particular species existing naturally evolving via numerous stages evolution cumulative effect causing changes occurrences emerging repeatedly recurring phenomena manifestations perceived initially observed subsequently interpreted latter reevaluated continuously updated revisited extensively analyzed evaluated thoroughly investigated systematically review studied critiqued scrutinized carefully considered experimentally verified tested corroborated supported confirmed validated empirically research substantiated quantifiable demonstrated qualifiably conclusive certified",
