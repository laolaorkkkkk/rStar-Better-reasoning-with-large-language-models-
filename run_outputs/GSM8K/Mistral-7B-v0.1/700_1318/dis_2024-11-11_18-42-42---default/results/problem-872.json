Thus adding these amounts together results into $9+$4=$13. Therefore, if David wanted three bottles of soda and two bottles of water it would add up to $$13$. This tells us just simply state \"$13.\" As your next part suggests you can create similar problems like this one but increase complexity based upon themes suggested within my previous answers such as mathematics involving calculation and algebra relating quantity/cost or comparison skills etc., I suggest looking through existing data related areas which may interest our client base when generating new content material. Examples could include statistics regarding consumer spending habits across different sectors/products classes over time periods \u2013 allowing analysts better understand market trends thus influencing decisions made among investors groups alike..
