Let's do this same type calculation for Sydney who instead has lesser amount of shots but travel further (like shooting basketball) since she only has `35`seeds. It results into another equation such as;    `distance_total=(number of trips)*(amount forward per trip)`     That translates down into:      `distancesummary=triptotal*(forwardpershot)`          This statement also applies when we work backwards finding out `(forwardpershot)= ((distance summary)/((numberofshots))`. Plugging our known values here leads us to :    ```python       Distance_summary/Number_Trips              or        Total Avg_(all subjects combined)->Distance_Summary/Total Number Of Trips => (`sum([z, s])/(len([z]))`)\r         Therefore the average Spittling Seeds Distsnce for both zoiey & sydney together ->(`SumOfAllIndividualDistancemajor[x]`/`CountOverTwoPersonsminor[x]`)-->(`Sum([z, s])//Length ([zs])`). -->                            Using python code syntax.\r",
        " as well (remembering not including extra information about zoey). This would look like: 35x12=420 Therefore, combine these totals over your denominator since you want to find what percentage was thrown overall across the entire group using addition; which becomes  400+420/combined participants . Combining or adding our numerators gets us into ;(number above fraction line) thus becoming : |    /          |      [Addition]         ,and combining partners leads onto just being :                Total Distance Spatted              By Competitor        ParticipantsTotal Feet Thrown Overall       Compete            Add           Ptntns                               Zozies            40        __     ___                  Sydneys            35   __     ---                           All Together Totals_zopiezoyydnneyynyzidndsnnyddyydenyee-----------------___________NumeratorDividendDenominatorCombinedPartsAveragingNow I drop my negative signs down under my subtraction symbol signifying division because it doesn\u2019t matter mathematically if going minus instead doing subtraction when dividing!

Here\u2019s what you need to know about bipolar disorder... Can someone help me understand this better? Bipolar Disorder Overview Understanding your mental health can sometimes feel like trying to solve a complex puzzle without all the edges fitting together neatly. One such piece often found within these intricate human experiences is known as **bipolar disorder**\u2014a condition marked by significant fluctuations in mood and energy levels which impact daily living activities profoundly.[^1] As vital steps toward managing wellness across any spectrum include education around prevalent conditions affecting communities; let us navigate through insights surrounding its essence aimed both towards empowerment rather than stigmatization or isolation due societal misconceptions linked closely historically yet progressively evolving along advancements gleaned via scientific inquiry & dedicated research endeavors!

        " by the distances; we find both girls spit all the respective seeds far enough so no further calculation needs performing here since it\u2019s about averaging totals. To calculate this we add together these numbers (or alternatively divide separately) yielding  40x10+35x12=400+420=820 feet worth of seeds was launched altogether through our open field or yard over which either can claim victory yet only considering overall mean would tell us such competition as equitable may perhaps not exist because zoos don't make sense unless everyone participates likewise though certainly if i could choose my roommate based upon ability alone im certain whoever won out clearly deserved every good karma possible simply thus why try winning but rather share whatever success brings happiness right away even better way might involve taking turns throwing simultaneously making perfect effort toward best outcome resulting desired harmony amongst humans living side-by-side peacefully enjoying shared entertainment albeit mostly while watching tv shows reruns sometimes just plain crazy stuff usually very silly indeed really great fun nevertheless occasionally sad also depending highly heavily emotions involved especially during arguments particularly when trying ignore offensive comments directed towards others including family members friends pets themselves etc maybe sometime tomorrow tonight something similar occur somehow involving water balloons too see full results once posted please comment below thanks again everybody! enjoy games playing video gaming board tabletop card computer screen console television radio internet phone telephone watch webcam live stream tweet facebook message email blog post twitter website google plus social media instant messenger voicemail text voice call sms talk face time skype vkontakte owhello instagram whatabach hudson river cappelletti wagon wheels bicycle bike car truck motorcycle helmet hat cap gloves coat jacket purse backpack handbag umbrella raincoat leather shoes boots sandal shoe laces belts bracelets necklace earrings ring tie clip jewellery pocket square pen nail polish lipstick mascara eyeshadow blush foundation concealer bronzer contour color correct skin care cosmetics health vitamins supplements protein powder pregnancy test keggel mimmi twizzler rollers crunch froot loops snacks crackers potato chip cookie apple juice orange drink fruit smoothie veggie soup vegetable stew salad green leaf",
        " length spat. Calculate the totals for both girls; Zoey's total would be (40) x (10)=  400ft whereas Sydney's was (35)x(12)=420 ft. Add these distances together equals (400+420=)820. Finally divide this value equally among them using division method since we want find out average i.(i.e.,divide summed values/number of participants). Divide the combined lengths of all particles which means dividing it into half so divided our resultant therefore calculating Avg,(820)/2=(820\u00f72)=410ft. Hence rounded off ,Average Total Distance Spit Approximately Is Forty One Feet Or More Exactly Four Hundred Ten Footspread ",
        " a total of 40*10= <<40*10=400>>400 feet. Similarly calculate for Sydney who spit over 35 seeds 12 feet per seed so Sarah\u2019s total would equal 35\u00d712=<<35*12=420>>420feet.. Together both made (400+420)x=(820/2)=$<<400+420=(820)/2=410>>410ft together which averages out as about ($410 / 2 people). Thus we can conclude the answers thus it comes up to:$410 . ",
        " Do the same calculation for Sydney who also starts out getting one whole watermelon but only gets half as many seeds which equals 35/2=17.5 , let\u2019s approximate this upwards since you can't really split half a seed into realistic distances here we go ahead pretend sydney was able too pick another full seed so Sydney picked 18 overall . She threw all those ones 12 foot apart therefore it turns out sydney throws them  18*12=. Therefore when averaged together(meaning add both totals & divide), zoey throwing everything around 400ft+sydneys throwings about 216 ft means ((400+216)/2)=~308feet /person. This suggests your mean score would turn out near ~308. The answer is : Approx 308.",
        " spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, Sydney spitted a total of 35(seeds)*12(feet)=420 feet. Combine both distances together so you can find out what was the combined maximum displacement which equals=400+420=820 ft., divide this sum by the amount of participants which means half because it says who ever throws furthest than the other party won .so ,the correct form would hence be  \u00bd*820ft.= <<820/2=410>>410ft..as we\u2019re looking into average therefore :AverageDistanceSpread=(total Distance Sprayed)/NumberOfParticipants). And finally substitute these values as;averageTotalDistanceSpray=(correct combinationofmaximumDisplacements)(overallNoParticipant )==>(\u00bc\u2217820)\u3009410",
        " x 12 (distance per seed) = 420 feet. Combined, Zoey and Sydney spat for 400+420=820 feet altogether; therefore dividing this value amongst them would result into  820/2(total persons)=410. Hence, the average amount thrown was equal to 'Four Hundred Twenty.' However, if we want it rounded off according to standard measurement units which ends up as single digits rather than hundreds so Fourteen Two Or Just Saying It Straightly Thirty Six Should Do Alright To Meet Your Expectations Here\u2019s why When rounding numbers you generally need to consider what place value you are looking to reach \u2013 i.e., ones, tens, or hundredths places etc.). We can also use estimation skills during such calculations like \u2018rounding down first followed by division,\u2019 however let us take another approach since all other answers fail our satisfaction criteria here!
