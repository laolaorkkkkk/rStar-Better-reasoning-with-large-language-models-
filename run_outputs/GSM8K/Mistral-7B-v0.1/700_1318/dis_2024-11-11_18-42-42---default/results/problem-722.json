Hence, overall savings can roughly estimate around ~$255 just considering direct monetary value (damage prevention). However keep note other indirect factors may add onto such financial benefits like reduced future risk related to vehicular wear & tear etc., but exact values might vary according individual circumstances hence subjective comparison based mainly upon immediate cash outflow vs perceived vehicle lifecycle impact too plays considerable role affecting net realized 'value'.

Therefore, by choosing to act against regulation, he actually saves potential costs minus consequences; so $450-$195 totals savings of $255 before considering moral or legal implications which may apply here too depending upon contextual details beyond monetary calculations alone.

As such, compared against this amount, taking care of the problem saves him $(195)-(450)$= $-255$. Since we don't subtract negative amounts when discussing savings -- meaning here one shouldn't consider saving since repair costs exceed possible compensations due to nonfixation -- we can take its absolute value; |(-255)|= $255 , hence solving this equation leaves us ruling out any kinda positive sum resulting 'out', but rather points towards considerable financial loss upon neglectance ..
