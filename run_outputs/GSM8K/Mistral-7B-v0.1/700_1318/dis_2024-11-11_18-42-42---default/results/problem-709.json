To find out how many quarts could be produced overall per hour when both types are being created simultaneously we add their respective amounts together, i.e., 50+12.5=62.5 quarts/hour. Hence in any amount of time during which production happens simultaneous productions take place (hours) such as say 't' this value times t equals our output quantity hence 62.5qts*48hrs = 3000qt(quarts). This means; if they keep up these rates without stopping or breaking down all throughout those entire four days its possible for them to produce thirty hundred individual one quart size container servings of delicious frozen treat delight!
