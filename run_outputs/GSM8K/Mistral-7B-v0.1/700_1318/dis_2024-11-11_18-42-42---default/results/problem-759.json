Mary can go swimming three times during Week 1 because Monday being considered Day One, Tuesday would not qualify (third day), Wednesday could count but Friday falls under our restriction criteria too since Sunday came out of bounds. Thus resulting into four successful attempts rather than thrice proposed initially.
