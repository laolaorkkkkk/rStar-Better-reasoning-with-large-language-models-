Half would mean dividing our set size(us states) by `x` means if i divide my set into halves then I get y parts meaning `(y/x)*set_size=number needed`. Substituting values above equation becomes (`half*total`)+4=(50)/2+(4)=<<50/2+4=29>>29 thus making our assumption valid since Indian states supposedly sum up totals of around about its own population numbers.(which isn\u2019t strictly true but works well enough within assumptions.)

Thus ,there would appear eight U.
