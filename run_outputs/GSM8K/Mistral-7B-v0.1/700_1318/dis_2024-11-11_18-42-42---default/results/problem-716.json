Given one unit(egg) takes up half part compared to another item like meat or vegetable since both required same quantity, if you consider any such non uniform object/ingredient which took smaller fractional measurement than anything else included within itself , i mean say measuring cup taken inside kitchen drawer . here comes importance : always make sure whatever measured portion remains constant irrespective upon different type usage during preparation time etc... because nothing gets mixed unless otherwise specified but only combination exists based around original size units being maintained throughout entire process prior reaching cook stage until actual consumption afterwards !

        " 450 kcal. Similarly, because we used exactly one portion (oz) as required according to conditions b & c, this means all six servings represent both items equally since 'equal amounts'. Therefore calculate these together first: add up caloric content contributed individually using their defined ratios which equals to 2*x(eggs)+y(ham). Substitute values found into equation above such way it becomes : y=((b)(a)/c)= ((6*x)*3/1), therefore substituting known variables results yields calculation like following simplified form or another valid mathematic expression based upon individual choices about order of operations but ultimately representing same resultant quantity; here denoted simply by letter z thus forming algebraic formula expressing desired outcome .
