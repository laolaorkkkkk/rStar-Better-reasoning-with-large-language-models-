Nonetheless , let me explain briefly why my previous assumption regarding calculation difficulty was correct : Each individual part comprises certain units known variables whose quantity affect change accordingly while interactively changing value amongst varying components therefore requiring additional steps necessary making overall outcome considerably greater compared directly versus using average/mean formulae instead simply calculating sum quantities divided equally regardless differences present during summation process even taking distribution rate changes under consideration . Still being aware results won differ somewhat depending specific circumstances involved hence reason behind considering averages alongside raw values becomes important sometimes despite apparent discrepancies resulting lack consistency needed ensuring accuracy maintained wherever applicable situation arising !

This quantity tells us just about every third month or quarter year bobert works outside of weekend workshops --sooner than half allotted!

Bobby also spends half an hour (or thirty minutes) for lunch every day; hence, if you combine this amount with the time spent on breaks it totals three periods lasting one and a quarter hours or 1.25 hrs altogether since sixty minutes make up just one hour.
