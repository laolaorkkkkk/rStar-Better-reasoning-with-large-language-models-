        " but mentions she worked twice as long as it took to tend the garden (which means four times as long since we only consider Amalia), meaning if Amalia\u2019s time can represent half or quarter hour blocks due to rounding purposes; thus three quarters would equal 3 hrs., making Megans job double that amount equalling six and one third hours spent walking the dog i.e., 6\u00behours approximately . Find out what duration tasks performed by other kids exceed compared to those accomplished by Amalia. From the question statement : \u201dDior had taken up doing household chores including cleaning dirty windows , dustpan sweeping and organizing stuff\u201d This implies that Dior might take about eighty percent lesser time overall because basic housekeeping activities usually last no extended period when considering efficient execution under usual circumstances even without mentioning explicit numerical detail within provided text segment ; therefore calculating around twenty seven fifteen hundredths [ ((2 / 5)\u00d7x ) ] minutes approximated equals seventeen point oh seconds rounded off hence close representation could either come near zero plus thirty \u2013 fifty minute range depending upon interpretation accuracy level chosen based respectively applied scenario variations thereby causing slight fluctuations resulting adjustment measures across different analysis interpretations owing differential context specific variances present amongst potential application cases whilst utilising generalised equation parameters such described hereunder regardless particular usage details notwithstanding any applicable mathematical constraints arising via said deviations during actual process undertaking phases conducted per standard normative protocol adherence requirements imposed primarily through associated relevant regulatory provisions governing designated operational procedures mandated exclusively specifically contemplating stipulated statutory guidelines etc..

Do not forget about diora's activity being described as 'well over four hrs later'; however no exact numerical value here implies we can assume any suitable amount larger but still adherent enough without getting into excessive granularity leading towards impractical outcomes or complexities thereby making simplifying approximation reasonable under certain pragmatics such asthatthismuststillbeoverthreeandunderfivehoursdifferentsomainthanfourwhichwouldindicateitsjustslightincrementfromourpreviousestimateofsixtothereforearwitha slight increasewecansettethetimeatseveralhoursexactnumberdoesnothingtochangeresultcalculationsofcoursesinceonlysummariesuchparametersintoabiggerwholefigureisnecessarywhereitshouldcountsoleydirecttimeexpendeddirecttaskexecutionrathernothingaboutotherfactorsspecificlikepersonalityproclivitiesintroducingvariablesforworkefficiencietyetcdueoinsteadavariablesnecesarreregardlesswhatanyprioritysettingdecisionmakinginvolvedetcthereforeyoucouldhaveachosenumberhereaftercomputingalltotaltimeswhateverthecaseletsusimplicitknowthattheywillgetsomekindsortsustableanswerthoughonepossibleoptionamongmanyvalidpossibilitysinfacteverysinglesecondsavedimpliesproductivityenhancessimpleaseneededeventhinkingforwardwithoutadditionalconsiderationsorcomplexlogistrumentsusefulwhencomparesimplifiedassistantsimplificationhelpingsomeobtainrealizationwhileminimizingmathematicalcomplicationpotentialerrorsriskpreciselybecausereducedemphasisonabstractdetailspermitsfocusmaintenanceconcreteobjectivesensibleoutcomevaluatedrelevantdatacollectionusingessentiallybasic arithmeticprinciplesusedbothapplicationalreasoninganalyticlogicstrategisingempiricalevidencebasedapproachefficientproblemsolvingguidedbypragmaticoptimisationmethodologiestargettingbestresultsattainedthroughmeticulousscrutinyperfectapplicationpreciseevaluationdetermineddependentactionsaffectchang",

It says Dior spent over four hours longer finishing the job compared to what Amaal needed for cutting grass.
