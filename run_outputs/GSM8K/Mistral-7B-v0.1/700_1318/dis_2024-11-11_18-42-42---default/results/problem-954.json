Hence multiplying again but taking away all those extra units since per single count(unit),we already halved everything; thus reducing original measurement quantity thereby getting rid off any unneeded elements while still maintaining accuracy within mathematical operations performed upon them throughout entire equation sequence process.(In summary these numbers represent what remains inside containers once removed.)
