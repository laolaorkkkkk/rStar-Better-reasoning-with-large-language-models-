Herein lies your solution: since both differences equal \u2018ten,\u2019 you could divide them across four parts (which represent teams individual contribution towards Team Totals), creating pairs like so (B - A = Ten)(A - D = Fourteen)= Zero(a situation suggesting equality amongst these participants.). Therefore one segment stands as Six/Two= Three which signifies every pair contributing respectively. Using this deduction reveal Bahati's highest possible marks within range bounds dictated by other competitors.(For instance if Bethaniya gets zero...Then\u2026Kwame also acquires zero...)
