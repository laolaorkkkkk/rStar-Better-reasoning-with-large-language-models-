This means that before building any houses during those two years, the house quantity stands at 12 (year one) plus 36 (from Year Two), which equals 12+36=48 already constructed housing units within fourteen months. Adding up both quantities yields us our required solution; thus resulting them being able to construct twice as many homes (or equal to their current home stockpile combined with additional newly developed ones): 12(existing unit)+36*2(for doubles)=12+(2*36).
