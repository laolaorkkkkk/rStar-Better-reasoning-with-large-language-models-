        " she spent (a)quarter(b)(c). Calculate what quantity this represents as percentages or fractions equivalent values ((d)). Recall we want a value equaling half their initial monetary amounts ($((e)) so solve for maggie\u2019s original sum using percentage arithmetic if not already known; otherwise perform arithmetical subtraction operation directly! Convert fraction into decimal representation (. . )and multiply it through corresponding variables $((. Find out ratio numbers comparing totals remaining= $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)\\times{(m)}=. \\quad Multiply across numerator denominators respectively leading towards forming compound expressions such=$(h)/$\\mid$/$(i); simplify expression under proper order yield result being less than=\\($\\underline{\\qquad}$ per person.) Thus finally answering part three considering combined efforts thus concluding $$j+k=\\$$where j=(x)$+$r+(x)*y$. Solving linear equations algebraically yields following solution sets:{p=$%\\%$, q=&q&} End task Execution",
        " what she had (which was previously stated as being equal to Riza). Since we know this equals actual dollar values ($60), you can determine it follows the equation X / 4= 60; solving for 'x', which represents their original combined balance yields X = 240. Thus, Maggie began with half or $120. Because Riza would also begin with an initial value equivalent to Maggie\u2019s starting point due to our assumption above regarding balances prior to expenditure, subtracting all amounts used determines remaining funds accordingly according to respective percentages consumed per person based off information provided earlier within these instructions relative to each individual subject matter scenario respectively henceforth yielding answers following below thusly:$45+($12)='$57'.
