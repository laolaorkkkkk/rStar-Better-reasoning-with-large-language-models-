        " (1/4) * 20 trucks failed. This equals 5 trucks. Thus, only 20 - 5 trucks successfully delivered their cargo, which amounts to 15 trucks. As mentioned earlier, each successful truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, these 15 trucks transported a combined total of 15 trucks * 20 tons per truck = 300 tons of fertiliser reaching the intended destination. Hence, the remaining amount would reach the actual customers or recipients i.e., this refers to the 'farms'. Consequently, out of every ton distributed across all the failing vehicles, we need to find what proportion actually made it through; essentially finding equivalent fractions such as comparing quantities. Since failure happened among one fourth initially, half (= 1/2), meaning 2 legs compared to original distribution quantity can make us derive effective ratio values. Accordingly calculating further results into equaling totals based upon known facts leading up till here within relevant contextual bounds using fundamental arithmetic logic constructively alongside algebraic operations like proportionality calculations when required alongside other mathematical concepts pertinent towards solving said problem effectively inclusive but excluding complex higher level mathematics otherwise unneeded due consideration necessary under current situation.

        " equals 15 functioning trucks remained (those which delivered). Since each truck carried 20 tons, those remaining can carry 15 times 20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons. Hence only these delivered 300 tons but originally it was supposed to carry double amount hence its worth would be twice as high i.e.,  300 * 2 or otherwise known as 'a full batch'. Therefore if we subtract this half loaded capacity of fully functional vehicles [i.e.(doubled)]from their actual load value[i.e.(half)],we get; Full Load Capacity \u2013 Half Loaded Value/Full Load Capacity = Difference Between Values ;( Double Tons\u2013HalfTonnes)/Double Tonnage=(Total Quantity of Fertility Delivered); [(2 *300)-(150)]/(2*300)=[(600-(150))]/600=[3*(150)]/600=150% . As percentage difference means relative change compared against one complete quantity,[as mentioned above]therefore Total Number Oftons Reached FarmerOn That Day Is 15%.

Halving 400 results into reduced transport capacity; hence logically assuming full success post initial mishap leaves us effectively needing recalculation based purely upon survivors/remainder.
