        " Monday, since Tanya taught 4 classes (more than 3) for 5 hours: Earnings = ($15/hour \u00d7 5 hours) + $5 = $75 + $5 = $80. Since this was only one day\u2019s work, we still need to calculate Wednesday\u2019s payment as well before combining them together into a single sum: Calculate Weds'. This case shows Tanya didn't meet the extra condition \u2013 it doesn't mention anything about earning or not earning any add-ons beyond regular paycheck. Hence here no addition needed besides simple multiplication based upon rate times time worked; We can solve all problems related directly linked toward either base rates multiplied over particular durations OR conditions which grant financial bonuses above usual compensation levels when predefined qualifications happen according contextually presented facts within texts provided earlierly introduced scenarios throughout current discussions amongst participants involved while ensuring accuracy remains maintained through precise usage descriptors relevant towards outcomes sought via established methodologies deemed best fit considering individual perspectives inherent those individuals hold personally regarding perceived effectiveness methods optimizing resultant output yields obtained post interventional actions enacting during initial stages set forth under examination purposes specifically focused around hypothetical situations described initially conveyor prior articulation processes henceforth proceeding accordingly applying principles gleaned following detailed observation analyses conducted systematically analyzed data interpretively processed derived results consequently deduced conclusive understanding facilitators designed utilize said information thus producing viable insights beneficial further applications potentially expanding scope extending breadth across multidisciplinary domains leveraged opportunities capitalized advantageous exploration ventures undertaken thereby advancing collective knowledge growth contributing meaningfully elevated societal comprehension enhancement practices implementing innovative approaches continual learning pursuits essential progress promoting sustainability nurturing humanity holistic development fostering harmonious coexistence universal welfare maximization efforts collaboratively executed amidst diverse cross functional teams harness synergies exploiting varied skills expertise generating unparalleled success stories inspiring aspirational narratives shaping tomorrow leaders empower transformational change embracing positive impact catalyst driving paradigm shift reshaping future possibilities manifest technological breakthroughs deliver tangible benefits improving lives quality experiences joy happiness fulfillment purposeful existence meanwhile challenging conventional wisdom disrupting status quo encouraging critical thinking",

Doing the same calculation as above but replacing one value changes nothing about the method or result; therefore calculate again for Wenndnes using new values ($2 instead of four).
