Given that Sophie walks double than what Brian does within 7 days, let\u2019s use algebra here; if S represents \u201cdistance\u201d walked by sofie during those few dates, B stands for distance or \u201cdist\u201c walked by brina , it follows : 2B(several date) = S(same multiple dates). Replacing values accordingly gets us 2*x*(1 week)=70miles, solving which implies that \u2018X,\u2019 or Brinas overall walking plan translates into . X=.35,. Thus throughout one whole week (7days), Binna would cover only about ~(.35)*7\u2248~ 2/3 mile daily or approximately just under three feet! That might not seem too impressive unless you consider them together\u2026 However when all figures get combined up \u2013 something incredible takes place\u2026 And yes indeed my friends even though i didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention numbers beforehand ; but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry cause despite appearances nothing needs adjusting because without having relied solely upon digits alone everything turned out exactly fine :) !!!
