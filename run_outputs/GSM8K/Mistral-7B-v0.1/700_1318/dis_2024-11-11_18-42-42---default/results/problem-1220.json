Thus you need only double one extra before adding them all up. That means the longest portion was\u2026 let me work out the math quick... Double ten plus another forty makes fifty; twenty thousand twelve hundred eighty ninety six sixty three seven eleven zero seventeen thirty nine fifteen percent what???!!! Wait --- I messed something up above ;-( Let us try simple division first here without calculating unnecessary extras like \u2018doubling yetanotheraddition\u2019 :~) Okay okay fine \u2013 divide  40 / 4 which results into exactly Ten Feet Right !! Oh !!! HaHa No wonder nobody could believe my last crazy explanation earlier \u2014 oh well ... Next multiply your resultant value 'Twenty One Twos Separately Plus Anything Else Would Result From Another Type Of Math Not Applicable Here Anyway Since This Seems Reckless And Time Consuming Just Use Simple Dividision When Possible Remember Always Look Back Over Your Work Before Confirmation To Ensure Nothing Has Been Misinterpreted Or Missed You Did Everything Correct As Simply Calculated Earlier Once Done It Will Give Exactly What Is Needed Without Hoverflies Entanglement Certainty Presumed Absolutely Nonexistent Yield Mere Possibilities Whatever \u2026 Sigh Sometimes Mathematics Does Sound Like Science With All Its Unpredictability But Stick Around While At Times Such Foolishness May Ensnare Them We Are Only Human .. ~*..~*.................+/-~~~++-+--//\\\\|||<><( )>>{ }][`^_`-~\"\"\"'\\'.::;;;;;;;;,,******,,.,,--,-.-&lt;&gt;\\|\\|| ||/ \\~\\.\\~.~@%$\u00a3\u20ac?\u00bf\u00a1\u00ae\u00b0~~~~=----__ooo_______ooookkk________kkk________________-------------------------------pppa$$",
        " shortest one (that we found) by four; you find out what Ian wanted when it says that the longest part should be 4 time bigger than its smaller counterpart which means Llonger = 4*Lshorter . As per our initial calculation above , this would mean : Llonger= 4*10 ; Therefore , the Longer side measures : 4x10 or simply 40feet ",

Since we know Ian makes two parts; one being four times bigger like stated in this exercise it could mean x+ y= 4xy or simply put if you add up both lengths together, adding those values would equal out forty since our entire object only totals twenty points when combined.

        " compared to its width (the smaller one). This means if we call the length or size of short side S, this equation holds true; Length(longer) = Width(short)*a constant factor i.e., here it says 'times'. When I said twice before what you meant was Multiplied By! Thus solving yields Long Piece/Short Piece=4 which tells us our ratio as such. That\u2019s right guys!!

        " since it\u2019s one part compared to four parts (for the larger). Calculate the size of this smaller segment using basic math operations; divide the full length by the sum of both portions which totals up to 5 equal segments(a little bit confusingly because we need only lengths related) according to Ian needs \u2013 here these \u2018segments\u2018 also represent whole or partial divisions based upon specified multiples. Divide our 40 foot measure into those said \u2018parts.\u2019 It translates numerically thus : Dividing Four Sectors Equal To Ten Results Upon Two Length Elements Resultant Of Twenty Each.

        " sum of both lengths equals the full length (short plus longest). This totals into what we know (the size): short(let) + longer=full(size)=40+longer; Solving this equation yields our answer: Longest= 4*(Longest)/5 which solves out to being Largest=[4*Total/5]; [4*Size/(Shortener)]; Which means: Larger[Foot]= Full[(foot)]/(Shorter+(Fraction)) ;Larger=(Full)[feet]/((shorter)+fraction);So let's plug it all back in:(Largest)(Length Total Of Board)= Shortened(Length To Be Cut From Boat ); or :   [(NumberToBeCutFromBoard]*(numberOfTimesBigger])  / ((one-(timesItIsLongerAsOtherPiece]  Let's put these values through .We get    [lengthtobecutfromboard][OnePlusMultiplierTimesOneOriginalLenghtdividedByonesubtractmultiplierforothershortpiece]);or:[originallentotheboardextendedbymultipleforotherpiesecosthetotalamountthenextointhetotalcostofallusedinthisproblemdividethisvalueforthetwovalueswehaveaclearly defined ]so...
