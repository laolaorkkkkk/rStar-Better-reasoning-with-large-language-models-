This means subtracting the amount of time needed under normal circumstances (using traditional or 'old') conditions minus what we find upon introduction ('new'). Thus, this implies taking out only seconds without round off until finding just whole values. Subtract these times within individual units not beyond hundredth figures so precision can\u2019t occur during practical calculations but still maintain clarity; thus eliminating decimals altogether while simplifying our mathematical representation hence arrives at : T_diff/paint=T_{New Var}/Painting - T{OldVariance}/Painting .
