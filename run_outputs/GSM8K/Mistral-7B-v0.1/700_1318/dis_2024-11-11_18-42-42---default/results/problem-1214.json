Hence, Jordan alters exactly 5 diapers every single day; one set for each kid since their quantity was not specified beyond shared totals herein presented as individual sets. ",
        " daily (for one parent), together they require 10 diaper changes a day. Half would mean the other parent or others handle about 5 diaper changes since this quantity includes both parents equally sharing responsibilities according to usual scenarios when considering only 'half.' Thus, Jordan also uses another 5 diapers during these times which adds up to a collective usage among all responsible parties without any specified distinction \u2013 hence we could imply it as shared duties here even if not directly stated but logically deduced due to lacking further specific context indicating otherwise; therefore, the most likely distribution based on common practices mentioned might suggest around approximately fourteen points six rounded off slightly above because fractional values typically signal unallocated/unassigned tasks so rounder figures seem fitting while preserving fairness within domestic environments such those discussed implying practical divisions rather strict numerical precision).
