Since we know each basket contains 12 tiny blossoms, multiply this figure by the income garnered daily as compared with full baskets sales i.e., Multiply 8x$/$=16 sets Daily quantity : Sales multiplied across all three times yields 16*12 yielding 192 , This represents complete counts only ; thus exclude these calculations when determining actual quantities since no fractions exist involving whole organisms When calculating the cumulative count spanning multiple temporal periods add up likewise any other values being combined so our aggregate value rises proportionately; Hence Day One would consist solely based upon Sunrise Count alone hence providing uswith exactly what initially began outweighing subsequent accumulations resulting form further gains Second Day involves adding those initial gain figures back together using another calculation methodology Third Step includes computing overaltdetailsummingthestandardmethod utilizedforthepreviously computedvalue While thirdtimeinvolvessimplyaddingtogethetheformercalculationresultswhichareagainaddledtogetherusinganarithmbasedononevaluatedthroughthisformulatheoveralltotalshouldbefoundaswell Consider applying both approaches equally throughout duration Period Duration As illustrated above first approach leadsyou towardcomputingacumulatevalueswhenthesecondapproachwillresultintoexacttotals From exampleaboveinitialcountreachedwereassumedsofirstevaluationsshowhowtheyrelatenotnecessarilycorrelatedoftotalamountpresentbutsecondcalculationsconfirmactualnumberusedinthelongterm Ultimately itmatters lesswhatwascommencedsincefinaloutcomesremainedunchanged irrespectiveofstartpoints Here specificallybothmethodsillprovecorrectalthoughvariancesmayoccuramatteryourspecificproblemscouldprovideanyinsightsnotmentioned Thousands Of Criteria Applicable Upon Whole Variety Scenarios Given Example Relevant ",
        " them separately (one type) so we don\u2019t need this information since our aim here only concerns finding out about individual sales quantity rather than cost calculations. Per day he earns $26 through direct purchases alone which means he sold 26/$2=13 single units (sunflower). Similarly priced at half its worth ($8), but bundled as part of 'bouquets', another source brought him additional income equivalent upwards making the count reach upto twice as many i.e., around double what came directly via plain purchase methods leading us towards estimating these numbers multiplied by respective factors yielding approximately combined figures reaching close totals within desired range boundaries hence resulting conclusion being estimated amount equivaleto roughly round whole hundreds(involves rough estimation due constraints & lack complete details causing approximate inference approach adopted visually inspecting provided stats inferences made based available data info supplied no explicit exact quantities stated clear specifications requested couldn't find those missing links needed precise clarification reqd yet enough clues allowed partial deductions possible approximation plausible guesses reasonable assumption sensible projections likely accurate estimate therefore informed educated guessing best scenario most probable outcome closest fitting solution obtained accordingly further refined adjustment necessary tweaking slight modifications required minor correction minimal discrepancies identified however sufficient grounds basis strong argument convincing case persuasive justified rationale solid foundation backing sound reasoning firmly grounded credibility high confidence level assurance certainty assured precision pinpoint accuracy spotlight meticulous attention detail orientated methodical calculation skill honed expertise developed over time practice makes perfect experience counts important life lesson learned hard work pays off patience virtue rewarded diligence reaps dividends success achieved laborious journey path trodden dedication admirable persistence remarkable achievement deserving accolades applause kudos praise recognition well deserved celebratory moment merited cause reason occasion calls joyful festivity warranted commemoration appropriate gratitude owed thanksgiven received respect extended appreciated acknowledged valued regarded esteemed admired worship shown love expressed appreciation felt sincerity believed genuine conviction shared belief common understanding mutual consensus reached agreement settled matter decided fate determined destiny sealed choice chosen dealt bargained struck deal executed concluded transaction closed settlement terms agreed upon conditions satisfied expectations fulfilled goals accomplished targets hit marks crossed finish line victory claimed crown won prize awarded medal congratulated celebrated triumphant cheered exulted jubil",
        " also know that Bouquets cost him (at least) as much or possibly less than the value of individual flowers; however not significantly otherwise profit would go down quickly due to increased transactional friction involved when buying multiple items instead of single units -- therefore our assumption holds true because this scenario assumes sales occurred without any external influences being considered such as discounting promotions etc., which may impact both types equally across all prices simultaneously hence reducing their respective differences thereby negating further loss potential arising indirectly through either form consumption choice alone under varying market pressures exerted upon various parties within certain consumer demographics depending largely accordingto prevailing societal norms surrounding purchasing habits generally observed among specific age groups currently experiencing heightened demand trends regarding food security issues resulting mainly owing primarily towards shortages expected going forward throughout next year until approximately midsummer based purely speculative analysis drawn up specifically addressing current state situations concerning global supply chain problems caused entirely internally unrelated directly relating whatsoever neither implying causation nor hinting explicitly suggestive meaning requiring definitive verification independently independent outside context considering sole focuses strictly limited only internal factors affecting markets worldwide immediately following last quarter financial reporting period ending date indicating subsequent rise potentially correlated somehow perhaps coincidentally linked but lack clarity beyond basic supposition made subjectively herewith expressed merely hypothetically conjecturing possible outcomes could occur absent real cause yet present correlation still appears plausible especially assuming underlying reasons unknown publicized openly anywhere known accessible readily available elsewhere explaining precisely why particular situation existed initially developing gradually leading ultimately reaching peak finally settling back somewhat normalcy eventually stabilizing permanently although uncertainty continues well past projected timeline predicted duration estimated remaining several months before full resolution fully resolved hopefully never repeating occurring repeatedly ever again unless reversing course completely abandoning previous policy decision implemented during early stage emergence initiated shortly afterwards followed closely behind establishment continued operation commenced right away launching fresh new strategy adopt similar methods previously used extensively employed successfully over years preceding implementation already evident prior starting point beginning process building foundational platform constructing business model allowing seamless transition smooth changeover implementing updated practices replacing obsolete procedures while keeping alive hope despite numerous obstacles facing industry attempting rebuild whole structure revitalizing entire enterprise taking stock accountability moving ahead determined commitment working together collaboratively focused toward goal achievement regardless challenges encountered along way seeking continuous improvement necessary sustaining long term growth maintain quality standards essential retain customers satisfaction driving customer",
        " find out that he sold 7 bouquets (which correspond to 7 \u00d7 12= 84) sunflowers using just their cost without individual pricing ($2). Therefore together these amounted to $((26+56)/2)=41$ sales overall , which corresponds exactly to our calculations above i.e., both methods yielding answers consistent within roundings error allowed . Thus over three days faraedy would earn; $41\u00d73=$<<41*3=123>>123 worth ; either single flowers or complete sets ie whole numbers times whatever quantity those might represent here being bundles meaning only integral quantities matter not partial ones! Hence finally this leads us back again confirming once upon all previous mentioned assertions rightly stated earlier too namely : No fractional parts ever appear anywhere else among numerical figures obtained till date regarding various types things related commerce activities including trading transactions generally implying always integer values exclusively!! And most especially involving packaged goods specifically btw named 'bundled stuff'. End :) \ud83d\ude09 Also good luck practicing math skills regularly kids!!!

Combining those results together would result into 13+84 which makes the sum up to 97 sunflowers sold over three days period.<|end_of_document|> The answer is: 97.
