Substitute known values into the formula so you get:`100.5 = x + [9*X]`, simplifying further :`100.5 = X*(1+(9))`Rearranging terms would lead us back to finding value of our unknown variable denoted as 'X'. Solving these equations together leads us to find out that Bobby's shoe measures approximately 10.2 centimeters or about 4 inches tall when rounded off.(Note: To convert cm to inch divide your results in cm unit termination points closer to 2/10th markings.)   ** The answers lies within those calculations performed above until reaching the point where no steps remain unaccounted.

This equals approximately  10 centimeters long as Shoe size varies among people but using basic conversion rule it would equate to around . To check this calculation let us add back the amount deducted initially i.e., dividing by 9 resulting into about ((96*9+1)-1)/9=96 ,which also suggests our initial assumption was correct so rounding up may not always work here because sizes generally don't follow simple division rules exactly especially when involving different units like cm and inches hence my previous statement might need corrections although still mathematically valid within its scope I am sorry if earlier misunderstanding caused confusion Here you go! Given Topher's footwear dimension translated directly results being incorrect due inherent nature variance across brands & measurement systems; Let S denote original value correspondingly interpreted via arithmetic operations thus applying inverse function yields approximate estimation approximated thereby yielding result 'approximately 8 inches'.
