To find out net remaining sum following all transactions follow these steps: Subtract first purchase cost ('comic') from total previous balance -> resulting figure becomes next starting point for further calculations (-$5), leading us back upwards towards accumulating value rather than diminishing it unlike case seen earlier during deducting second item purchased('puzzle').

Subtract this cost from the previous total to find out what quantity remains; so, $32 - $5 equals $27 remaining funds before purchasing any other items or making further adjustments. Perform another calculation identifying next transaction i.e., spending $19 on buying a Puzzle; deduct this value from Ray\u2019s existing balance ($27). Hence new savings totality becomes: $27-$19= $8 .
