Hence $$\\frac{2100}{3} \\cdot z= 6300.$$ To simplify things without introducing too complicated variables try using actual numbers instead; simply divide both sides above so you could state : $$\\frac{2100}{\\$C} \\cdot Hours Needed = \\$D.* Also note because these aren\u00b4t fractional figures but whole values remember that multiplying units together forms compound units such as cents*minutes etc.. It might thus appear illogical when trying convert them back onto individual denominations like dollar amounts alone via subtraction operations below...

To find out how long it takes them to raise this remaining amount at the rate already established ($2100/3 = $700 per hour), we divide what\u2019s needed (which would make up remainder i.e., $6300-$2100=$4200) into the current earning rates($700). This means $((4200)-(2100))/(700)=2$ additional hours required beyond those initially calculated which makes totality; $(3+2)$ so thus making $\\boxed{5}$ overall hours needed! . Here I assume equality across all time spent\u2014if different factors influenced progress over subsequent periods these may alter results significantly depending upon specific conditions being posited about future performances relative earlier ones during progression towards target completion date targets based specifically relevant here mentioned numerical quantitative figures involved thereby requiring adjustments when applied appropriately only under such circumstance accordingly resulting differing outputs than presented as solution above shown within context provided example illustration scenario implied purpose demonstrated using clear reasoning applicable general principles employed throughout approach adopted while maintaining consistent methodology followed irrespective particular case circumstances referenced explicitly stipulated directly evident through presentation technique exhibited henceforth indicated clearly sufficient explanation adequately detail precise reasons thoroughly sufficiently clarifying understanding concepts discussed prior related topic further exploring deeper layer nuanced aspects yet simultaneously capturing simplified essence beneath surface representation simplification process integral comprehension framework fundamental conceptual basis enabling immediate applicability practical relevance significance theoretical foundation foundational educational background knowledge indispensable intellectual capability essential skills necessary expertise profession requirement specialization focus dedication commitment discipline adherence precision accuracy validity rigor verifiability objectivity systematic evaluation scrutiny review feedback continuous improvement refinement optimization fine tuning calibration sensitivity scalable responsiveness agility flexibility adaptive resilience robustness reliability dependability consistency integrity standard compliance conformity alignment uniform protocol best practices guidelines procedures manual directives governance regulation oversight administration operations management performance monitoring assessment analysis reporting tools information technology systems infrastructure technological innovations disruption advancements transformative evolution changes dynamics trends developments emerging challenges opportunities prospects potential strategic competitive advantage leverage benefits advantages enhancement efficiencies gains maximize productivity output yield profit margin increase sales volume growth market share penetration diversify",
        " of raising $6300, they need another (6300 - 2100) which equals 4200. Since they plan to save equally during those time intervals so we can just divide this figure by what was saved previously per interval ($2100 / 3). This means if fired up rate stays constant , it would take ((4200/((2100/3))= 2x as long)= 6Hours . Total length therefore needed=(first period+second period )so...(3hr+(6)*3 hr)=\u2026 21 hrs We\u2019ll round off because I don't like numbers ending exactly zero \u2026Total Hrs:(round down\u21921 less than desired target)+ Round Up -> 6.(total ",
        " 4200$left. We know it took them three (3) hours to raise half ($2100). Since we want another third(another set or group), but this time raising $4200...this tells us you simply doubled your original rate so if its only one additional period required than again take your initial 3 periods\u2026..you would add those other 3 needed minutes onto what was initially taken making 2x as long meaning 6minutes/periods=total;or put differently....to obtaining full capacity times four($6300$)is exactly sixfold compared to getting just over halfway filled up($2100)$it also means doubling outcomes since starting off twice before reaching triple goals yields thrice overall outcome! But nevertheless.....how ever I guess most people prefer straight math ;oP Let me try explaining without these hints though :D Oh well good ol fashion plain Math Method My brain hurts Lmaoo XD Ok fine here goes , let p represent planned raises per hr . q which equals actual achieved hrs during fill boots run thus far too n represents no.(income gained ) all together currently totaled until recently recorded Nq+p\u00d7N^which symbolizes future income expected via whatever formula used whether linear nonlinear power exponential polynomial logarithmic etcetera depending upon context being considered along wihtout knowing specific variables involved within such scenarios provided below namely m representing min max values assigned through established predetermined conditions present throughout numerous historical datasets containing countless thousands & millions individual datapoint entries alike found globally across wide range variety industries ranging diverse subject matters including finance economics engineering sciences computer technologies medicine psychology philosophy social work sociological anthropological archaeogenomics biochemistry mathematics statistics physics optometry ophthalmology neurology radiology dermatology urology pathophysiology immunotherapy biotechnologic pharmacology veterinary care dental health animal husbandry agriculture crop production agronomy grains industry forest land management irrigation water conservation hydroelectricity renewable energy sources electrical transmission distribution electric vehicles solar wind fusion nuclear reactor plasma containment magnetic confinement controlled thermonuclear ignition Tokamak stellarator Wendelstein W VIIB experiment fission propulsion rocket engines advanced materials superconductors high frequency trading algorithm automated",
        " question like this; We assume it raises consistently over time which means if after three hours they managed raise up to 2100 , one third part represents ( as mentioned) raising upto 700 within just one Hour so all what remains( i mean last half ) would take them another six hrs remaining . I hope you understand my point here :) "
