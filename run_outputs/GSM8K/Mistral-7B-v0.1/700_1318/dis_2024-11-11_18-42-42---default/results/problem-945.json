        " Alex travelled before stopping on Island Eighty Six. Since Jame sails until reaching one-third (which we assume) into Lake Sixty Two towards Islands Daring and Delicious. One third multiplied by sixty-two equated to twenty zero point six seven or less than thirty kilometers if rounding down due its impossibility because water bodies don\u2019t exist partially like cities/countries would hence rounded up totalling to about thirty three. Hence sailors reach forty four kilometres away form Isle Fantastical which isn\u2018T actual but rather symbolic since this marks division points being twelve minutes duration so adding them together amounts seventeen hours without considering any stopover breaks within those travelling stages thus leaving us eighteen hrs fifty eight min exactly although other factors influencing arrival times aren \u2018T taken into account such weather conditions .
