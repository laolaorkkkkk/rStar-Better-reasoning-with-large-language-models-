Finally calculate savings as ($50)$saved$/$week so multiply saving rate against one working duration i.e.$50*7=$350 therefore reduced cost becomes less when compared to initial pricing structure making it seemingly advantageous over time if no other factors came in play..

Next calculate current expenses employing similar logic as above; i.e., find out the amount spend when purchasing tomatoes through their present provider which implies doing this product sale price currently (.4)*future production size (=500)=$, therefore ,= $$200/. Hence determine savings simply via subtraction formula utilizing numbers found below such as so :- [previous spending]-$current spending[$175$-$200]$=-[-$25].
