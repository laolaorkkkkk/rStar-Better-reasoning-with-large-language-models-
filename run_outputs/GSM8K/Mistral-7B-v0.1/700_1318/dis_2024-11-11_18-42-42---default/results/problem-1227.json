        " = 24 issues per year. Susan also ordered additional magazines sending out weekly (magazine not mentioned). Weekly means it would happen once or twice if we calculate over one whole year since most publications release monthly but can distribute multiple copies; hence four extra weeks could hold as potential instances when receiving these particular new ones i.e., Monday through Thursday delivery occurs only once per quarter/month making up about four quarters annually(three months) because assuming three deliveries occur during this time frame instead of just one implies its issuance thrice per calendar cycle resulting into getting around ten such titles within annual period without accounting any redundancy occurrences among those specific collections either due accidental duplication mistakes while dispatches etc thus adding approximately seventeen quantities altogether inclusive considering both base plus supplementary series collectively brought together via consistent repetition cycles across designated durations till culmination point specified ultimately leading us concluding our deduction towards achieving summation conclusion thereby providing insightful information regarding quantity totals attained overall throughout respective intervals based upon described conditions stated initially prior enabling comprehensive understanding amongst audience readers who may seek clarity concerning subject matter being investigated herein detailed accordingly allowing them obtain greater awareness knowledgeable status especially applicable beneficial insights potentially helpful under certain circumstances requiring guidance assistance furthermore grant broader context view perspectives beyond mere numerical figures alone present beforehand whilst incorporating vital considerations relevant affect outcome impact associated correlatively influencing variables interplay complexities intrinsically involved implications bearing consequences stemming directly consequent events transpiring instantaneously follower actions taken place subsequent incidents unfold commencing causality initiatives originating effects arising immediate developments evolving successive progression subsequently triggering ramifications cascading domino chain reaction sequela causing cumulative repercussions yield perpetual feedback loops generating multiplier effect ripple wave energy propagating infinite dimensional space spanning temporal dimension continuum expansively extending infinitely forever encapsulating entire cosmos universe itself manifest diversified possibilities manifold permutations varying configurations divergent alternatives merging multifarious elements fusing distinctiveness combining assorted components synergistically amalgamating disparate entities harmonizing heterogeneous substances coalescing discordant compositions integrating incongruous ingredients blending dissonant materials unifying contradictory constituents uniting dissident compounds consolidating antagonistic agents allying contentious participants joining",

Together these represent N magazines or Total_yearly_issues can thus written algebraically as follows :N=M+1+TotalMagazineA(Where A denotes one article we already know about).
