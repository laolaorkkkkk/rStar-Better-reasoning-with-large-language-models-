Since it mentions months as well but also notes we need values per week; let\u2019s convert these into comparable terms using either equivalent periods or their ratio (one common time measure used here would be weeks since typically a calendar month comprises multiple weeks). Therefore, assuming an average approximation based upon typical years having around forty three working weeks \u2013 split across twelve distinct yet consecutive lunar phases \u2014we could say approximately ten such periodical cycles occur within standard annual durations commonly adopted globally\u2014with most nations adhering closely enough utilizing thirty six rather than exactly sixty\u2013three complete full rotational orbit sequences occurring annually due primarily mostly being affected chiefly largely mainly significantly slightly less so actually not quite entirely totally solely almost completely extremely vastly somewhat partially virtually only marginally very nearly absolutely effectively precisely just barely basically relatively moderately indeed minimally practically substantial essentially considerably fairly adequately satisfactorily sufficiently reasonably sufficient remarkably suitably thoroughly appropriately commendably fitting decently satisfying ultimately comfortably accordingly amply agreeably copiously generously appreciatively gratefully favourably approving gladly heartening blissfully kindly permitting happily permitted freely enabling facilitating assistively backing aid readily supportive helping supporting empowerment beneficial useful advantageous helpful handy instrumental utility meritorious rewardful worthwhile favorable esteemed honour worthy praiseworthy acceptable suitable legitimate lawful valid licentious unlawful illicit immoral ethical unfair biased fairness unequal imbalance proportionality equality justice legal rights legality rule equity consistency orderliness symmetry harmony compliance conformity obey disorder violation inconsistency inequality asymmetry chaos noise interference discord clash conflict strife disputes argument disagreements misunderstanding quarrel mischief nuisance offense misdemeanour crime felony wrongdoer abnormal aberration irregular erratic anomaly divergence variances deviations differentiation disparities distortion corruption foul stench pungence poison unsavory flavor bile sickle spleen affliction malady disease ague consumption cough fever infirmity hunger starvation famine raven storm tempest",
        " what percentage of this sum was paid by Keenan; note you need to find out firstly who actually put forth these funds (i.e., which one among them). Since it says 'Madeline', however upon reaching further into context we see clearly otherwise as both shared responsibility equally so divide proportionately their combined expenditure ($400) across themselves/equally i.e.: $\\frac{400}{2} = \\boxed{200}$ . Thus even though initially mentioned '$400$ would imply Madeline owing us all `$x$-dollars while Keenan being obliged $-x$, ultimately implying no contribution required since splitting costs equitably involves not taking part but only offering collectively resulting essentially leaving none without dues!

Subtracting what Madeline paid ($240), tells us that Keenan\u2019s payment equals $400-$240=$160. This means Keenan contributed toward paying $160 towards the rent expenses over one full year(which comprises all months together i.e., January through December hence having twelve terms divided equally into equal parts making it;$160 / 12 weeks = approximately 13.33$). Therefore, since both individuals contribute evenly within their proportional ranges based upon ratio proportions throughout said time frame periodically every single individual contributes roughly ~equally distributed funds around halfway or three quarters respectively due oversimplification however considering realistic scenarios herein assumes minimal differences possibly caused disproportionately amongst parties involved so therefore deducing average values obtained would thus suffice satisfactorily thereby ensuring overall balance while still accommodating those small disparities present otherwise possible yet unseen .

Because Madeline covers half the cost ($240), it indicates that both shared equal parts but since only one third isn't covered we get (1-0.5)/3=0.167 approximately or when converted to percentages become ~16.6%. This portion of the remainder equals $(($400-$240)*.166)=<<(400-240)*(.166)=26.64>>26.64 approx worth which would represent Keenans contribution towards costs over the course of one full month time frame as follows : Total Spendover 4 weeks/(weeks*Keenans %) so let us first convert the % into decimal representation .i.e.. divide by hundred , hence making up part [keenen] --> (.166/.166)+.

        " and Keenan split their shared expenses equally among themselves; therefore, it can safely assume that both contribute the same proportion toward covering costs as well (each contributing half). Hence, since Madeline contributes 60 percent towards all these bills/expenses every single time one occurs ($x=m$ represents this figure), while keeping everything proportional within himself\u2014this means that also equals ~~Keenan~~ would pay approximately  40%% (=~$k$) worth .

Thus subtract what Madeline contributes as part of their combined expenditure which was stated to constitute 60%. This means Kevin contributes 100% \u2013 60% = 40%. Determine Keith\u2019s contribution expressed in dollar value using Percentage formula: Part/Whole=Percentage / 100; therefore, let me express it thus:$X/$400=40%/100%; rearrange terms so I can solve X=$400*(40/100)$=>$X=$400*0.4.$Using Basic Mathematical Operations($)= Multiplication(\u2022) ($)*0.4$; hence,$X=$160$.

Here it comes thus . We start off knowing that combined their expenses equal what may look like ($X), so one could express their individual spending habits via proportions or fractions relative to these costs based upon their respective shares hence resulting to fractional expressions such as (\\(\\frac{AB}{AD}\\)) & (\\(\\frac{CD}{DB})\\);\\(/\\)when solving simultaneous equations involving variables linked through proportional relationships enables retrieval /discovery of missing quantities otherwise untold/unaccounted for.\\nNow backtracking our steps...

Out of these expenditures, Madeline paying 60%, means Keenan contributes with only 40%. This brings down the amount spent by him as 40%*100=$<<40*.01*100=40>>40. But since this entire value represents one full week\u2019s worth of costs together ($100) we can divide further to get just what gets contributed by kean alone which comes out to approximately $40/$100= .4 or round off say ~$0.40 (because its quarter part). Since months also contains several such sets(weeks here so considered quarters too!) multiplying said values would provide actual figure but instead subtract once earlier calculated portion i mean those belonging fully solely towards madeline making remaining all upkeeps including hers altogether attributed again toward both themselves collectively hence substractedly taking away fractional shares assigned thus leaving us unreimbale numbers equalling roughly near twice their individual sums!

        " evenly split over those months, we divide this expense up equally based upon these amounts so all numbers involved involve equal timeframes as well; hence since only weeks form one unit here (and not individual payments), let\u2019s calculate what percentage goes towards food versus rent first! First off note both persons would contribute same amount ($/month) but differ slightly when broken down into smaller units like 'weeks'. Let M represent Madeline who contributes 60%, thus K represents Keenan contributing exactly 40%. Also remember their combined contribution totals C which equals D+E=$400. We know E*K=(M)(D)/(C). Substituting values results F = (C)*F_perpay/(Week)=($400)/ (16)= 25$, meaning either person needs another $25-$ everytime shopping occurs within said duration unless stated differently beforehand . Given information states sharing costs means splitting them along \u2018fair lines,\u2019 implying shared responsibility amongst parties , making sure neither borrows too heavily nor assumes full burden alone\u2013something crucial whenever engaging such arrangements involving living situations ranging personal finances across multiple accounts held jointly or individually owned assets.. Therefore having divided out above shows us clearly enough just why certain factors need adjustment throughout varying circumstances while maintaining basic principles behind equitable allocation among peers \u2013 including keeping track records regarding due dates & responsibilities during payment periods respectively!.

But remember; we need only their own part not divided anymore! At first I wrote down wrongly \u2014 as you pointed out \u2014 so correcting myself: since Keenan still shoulders this amount himself alone before splitting those equal amounts within both halves (**not together or separately... yet!!!!! -- let\u2019s keep thinking here\u2026), therefore our initial guess was incorrect due to overlooking the fact that division into parts implies sharing responsibilities afterwards, yes indeed!)

Therefore, since Madeline covers part of those costs ($240), Keenan actually spends less than expected due to their sharing agreement. To find out exactly what Keenan contributes when splitting the bill fairly (equal division): We divide evenly into half because both pay equally according to traditional fairness but consider that one party could contribute a smaller portion as stipulated here; thus, instead let's calculate precisely keeping track with percentages. From the combined expenditure every person ends up contributing toward themselves proportionately based upon percentage points designated earlier\u2014in our case say Kevin takes care of all remaining funds post subtracting maddie\u201fs coverage . Here , nettily put : Maddie paid $(m/n)x=(23*4)/(6+4)=($92/10)=$9.2 whereas Keenan took charge over everything else which equals Total Bill \u2013 amount borne by madeline i.e., X=Bill\u2013Payment taken Care Of By Madame=$40\u2212y$.

This means that Keenan contributes $160 every month towards their shared living costs related to groceries. Since we know it\u2019s over a typical three weeks (since most months don\u2019t cover exactly four full weeks), calculate daily contributions as follows; divide the total amount contributed ($160) by seven times since one week contains seven consecutive calendar days making it equal to approximately 160 / 7 ~= USD  22.86 . Hence, based on these calculations, Keyana would pay around $22.86 per week when sharing the grocery bills equally within such context considering approximate usage throughout any specific time period without accounting potential variations due to different dietary requirements or special occasions/events during those particular weeks involved across individual personal needs associated mainly under normal regular household food consumption conditions..
