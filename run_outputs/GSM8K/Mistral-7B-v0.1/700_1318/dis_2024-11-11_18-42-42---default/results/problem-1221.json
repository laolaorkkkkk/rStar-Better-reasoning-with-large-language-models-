        " We know one pound yields sixteen meatballs. Therefore if we want eighty meatballs (divide this quantity/sixteen), it means three whole pounds of minced beef would suffice. As per our recipe notes, you add two tablespoons of your special sauce mix for every single pound used. Multiply thus amount times total required portions; therefore double twelve equals twenty four \u2013 meaning forty-eight teaspoons or exactly half cup measuring spoon full! ",
        " it takes (1/16)th\u00a0pounds of ground beef to produce one meatball; therefore four times as many [i.e., (1/16)*(4)] or (1/4)\u00a0pounds of ground beef can create eighty meatballs if multiplied through so this amounts to [(1 / 4 )] \u00d7 [80]. This equals twenty (20). Hence we see clearly that eighteen pounds of ground beef would result in sixty meatsballs being made while thus only ten extra meatballs require another half lb (or .25)\u2019 worth of Ground Beef which thereby necessitates adding just under doubled amount ((1/(1/4))\u00d7(1)).

        " 80 meatballs, so let's find out how many pounds he\u2019ll use; we divide 80 (total desired meatballs) by 16 (meatballs produced per pound), which equals 5. That means Aiden requires 5 pounds of grounds beef. Since this recipe calls for using twice as much steakhouse sauce spice for ever one lb of meat. We take those  5 pounds \u00d7 2 Tablespoon/pound= 10 teaspoons or about half cup..

This works because mathematically speaking\u2026 well lets call them 'mathematicians': ;-) !!! Math can often seem intimidating but trust me\u2013there exists only three basic rules within its realm called division/multiplication alongwith fractions(ratios); these rule set helps simplify even complex problems such mine just fine :) ;) . As always remember\u2014practice brings mastery hence practice hard kids :D But before going off into any other mathematical musings again allow me too finish quickly say something about food like so :-). It seems certain ingredients may require different proportions depending upon quantities being prepared however generally keeping everything else constant means applying said proportion linear scaling right away wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone might actually save time saving lives maybe ?

You get this as you divided both sides of your equation which simplifies down into 5 pounds if it would not simplify further than necessary.

        " pounds of ground beef. As mentioned earlier one pound needs two tablespoons of seasoning so therefore; if you use 5 pounds it would take ;5 times 2=<<5*2=10>>10 tablespoons..

Therefore, considering all options provided initially; option C or D would technically seem possible as both include quantities divisible into our exact requirement but when scrutinizing further 'D : Two bottles contain fifty millilitres.' , it indicates twenty grams less than what was asked which makes this choice incorrect based on calculation discrepancies even though their measurements might appear closer numerically due to units not being identical hence remaining undetermined still . Subsequently opting back onto previously calculated needs rather leads us conclusively towards 'C'.
