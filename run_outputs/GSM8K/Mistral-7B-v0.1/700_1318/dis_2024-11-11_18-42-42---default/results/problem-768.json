Next, since Ezra decides to read 150 more books within the same hour when initially counting only those first reading instances; these additional books don't change the count because all actions took place over just 'one hour'. Hence, both together during any specific hour would still mean they collectively contributed towards their respective totals without affecting each other directly. Consequently, summing up separately\u2014in terms mentioned before which didn't entail time extensions post initial calculations\u2014Ezra has not surpassed beyond his existing ledger mark due to subsequent pledges made under specified constraints despite further intentions expressed or pursued independently afterwards regardless unless otherwise stated explicitly connecting such follow ups.

Combining their reading capacity over 1hour yields three hundred plus fifteen equals Three One Hundred And Fifteen [315]. As such when Ezrah decides later to add another quantity equivalent to fifty percent less than what Azhar achieved; namely seventyfive[(((1*15)*FiveHalf)MinusSevenHalves)]BookHe could possibly achieve.
