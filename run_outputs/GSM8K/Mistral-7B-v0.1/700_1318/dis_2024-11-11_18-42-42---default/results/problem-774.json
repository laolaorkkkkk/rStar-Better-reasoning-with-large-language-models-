To determine remaining available times we subtract six(hours)-three=(-3)(hrs). Therefore Jack was absent/gone from home (-3 hrs ). The answer is: \"-3\".

Firstly since both ways need equal amount same equation applies , hence doubling up figures involved as well ; i mean assuming travelling alone without any stops takes entirety needed duration regardless location specifications mentioned anywhere else other than actual journey direction itself.. That adds another ten minutes extra because those activities add quite considerable chunk too!

Consider also the fact that jack stays out at the museum for additional six hours before travelling hence totalling four plus six equal ten or eleven respectively depending if you count returning journey too but either way this doesn\u2019t matter because we need only initial departure duration!
