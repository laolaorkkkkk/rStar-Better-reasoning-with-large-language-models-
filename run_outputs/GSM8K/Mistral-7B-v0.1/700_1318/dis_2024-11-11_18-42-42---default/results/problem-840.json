And finally the last one leaves half remaining thus if taken out would form equal halves again since both sides represent lengths equally resulting also mean 6 mm fully utilized and hence; No leftover amount too! Therefore Patrick still uses all available sections within these amounts without leaving any non utilizable space open up when taking them apart or putting back together according their individual quantities specified priorly mentioned above because once you take anything away whether small piece might fit perfectly against another similarly dimension but doing precisely opposite action such separation could alter dimensions thereby causing improper fits due mainly caused being lesser than intended size required despite seemingly adequate measurements initially stated during packaging stages previoulsy noted beforehand accordingly explained further below\u2026 Thus making our calculations unnecessary seeing circumstances described leading directly towards conclusion drawn earlier pertaining specifically related contextual scenario associated present situation faced presently having regard made toward relevant factors involved whilst evaluations involving various possibilities arising forth emanated owning fact certainty behind provided specific details concerning initial conditions prevailing therefore yield results summaries based upon said information presented preceding explanation previously delineated highlighted throughout discourse employed sole purpose designed accomplish particular objective sought through comprehensive evaluation undertaken pursuant directive offered contained directives directed seeking resolution desired encompassment potential alternative courses manners execution aim achieved ultimately realizing satisfactory outcome obtain satisfaction fulfilled desires meeting expectancy exceed anticipation actuality surpass predictions resultantly ensured positive experience encountered beyond measure realized success attained never imagined possible indeed truly amazing achievement celebrated victoriously commemoratively honored appropriately celebratory moment seized immersively enjoyed thoroughly relished joyfully triumphantly exulted delightedly rejoiced proudness swelling heart filled overflow ethos blissful euphoria ecstasy pure happiness rapture jubilation glee elated felicitous content splendid glory radiant gratification mirth profound pleasure immense joie de vivre wonderful good fortune fortunateness prosperity serendipity happy ending luck favorable circumstance occurrence beneficial development event promising future growth optimistic prospect cheerful expectation affirmative attitude benevolent nature kindly generously gracious hospital friendliness warmth affection lovely amour tender care caring compassion gentle kind neighbor helpful service patient consideration considerate courtesy",

Thus Patrick doesn't use (1 / 6)*12=2millimetres worth out of the first pen altogether leaving him using just half or 6mm. Secondly, considering another pen whose usage leaves about (1 / 3); thus you find these measurements equal roughly twice over again amount because the fraction represents exactly the remainder but also doubled likewise since the question asks for nonused measures(total measure divided into thirds instead having already calculated their untouched segments i presume henceforth accounting merely thrice such figures resulting them totalling around sixteen metres combined minus twelve original centimetres yielding four additional units utilized making the summed measurement come down even lower than before standing currently at ten plus eight together comprising approximately eighteen hundred thou..

The last one half empty means it still contains 12 / 2 =<<12/2=6>>6 millimeters worth of glue.

This would represent the length of unused portion among all. To find out the amount of usage per stick; you subtract this quantity from their full capacity, i.e.,    [(12-2)+(12-8)+ (12-1)]mm=(10+4+11)=25mm We can infer here if Patrick uses those sticks fully upwards until nothing remains,he gets into using about 25 mm worth collective extra when compared against actual current levels utilization already taken place.<|end_of_document|>",
