Finally divide this amount among those who wanted food; since there are four people including Henry himself, we need to find out what remainder would leave when divided by these four individuals(the 'quotient'). Therefore, use integer division (denoted as /). Thus, dividing the resultant quotient over 4 amounts yields three whole slices remaining before even getting close to equal distribution amongst everyone involved. Or another way around could involve subtracting away every fourth slice right down until no divisible groups remain\u2014this time yielding six additional full shares split across our group making it feasible!

        "/4 or approximately 1.75 pizzas (since you cannot split up actual pizzas). Since one whole pizza yields 8 slices when divided among four individuals would yield three sets of four equal parts which adds up totalling twelve portions per individual (three quarters multiplied by eight equals six), so if we multiply these together \u2013 it implies everyone receives sixty percent less than half. Therefore ,each friend ends up receiving exactly twenty-four slices as shown below;  7 \u00d7 8 / (4+3) . This comes out to forty-one sixth, rounded off this equates roughly thirty point seven five six but actually only about just over eleven.
