To conclude , we see that as every transaction happens once within this period i.e., each time only during any particular point in the timeline not repeatedly therefore no compounding effect takes place..

        " to find out how much this would cost over one week (as months generally refer to longer time frames than weeks). Each day costs three times, so daily feeding totals $3 ($1/fish \u00d7 3 fish). This means every single Sunday through Saturday sums up to sixteen periods within April itself (consider four consecutive Sundays plus another Monday \u2013 Tuesdays until the last Friday) equals sixty-four portions (sixteen multiplied by their respective duration; which averages roughly eight meals across most seasons since no specific timing was provided), resulting into $64 spent during full moon or new Moon phases because those lunar calendar alignments might inspire increased pet spending habits due to heightened emotional states as observed amongst our ancestors tracking animal behaviors associated with such events..
