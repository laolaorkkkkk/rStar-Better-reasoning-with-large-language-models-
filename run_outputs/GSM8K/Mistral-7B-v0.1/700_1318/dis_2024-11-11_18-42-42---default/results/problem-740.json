Subtract these values we determined above concerning baking , breadcrumbing and tennis court activities from our starting count therefore; subtracting both ten lovers of making cakes plus roughly seventeen gamers makes twenty-three minus thirty yields negative seven but since you can\u2019t really get less than zero members I reckon my initial assumption about relative population sizes was wrong i needa make adjustments :if n represents the student body size(which equaled fifty) p% represent percentage favourite sports other than table tennis hence calculating them results into ; [p/100*(n-(b+k))=fifty/(10+(2*five)=twenty]this means only fifteen enjoy musical pursuits because twelve remain thus eliminated due their allegiance to virtual escapism..now go back up stairs remove all fans including ones mentioned earlier leave us with just eleven remaining fellowship enthusiast!",

As our original group consisted only of  50 individuals we could easily infer what remains thus remaining numbers equaling :  50-(25+Video game players). Subtracting all these figures equate itself into being exactly the same count equivalent to Video Game Lover groups i.e., [50 - 25 ] / 2 equals precisely half hence yielding 12 Group members dedicated towards gaming activities exclusively.

Hence it makes up N(students), such that N=(Total no.-of-students)-[No.(baking)+ No.(baseball).] Since Basketball includes both male & female participation so let's consider only males here too because females would fall under Video game / Music participants but not necessarily equal distribution across them since girls may also go together for sports rather than individual activity alone based upon their preference etc; thus leaving Male Base Ball lovers out completely without counting anyone else involved thereby reducing overall count downwards significantly towards zero hence resulting inequality equation becomes :N > [(Totno./males)*Female]+((totalf/male- Tbo)*totalf)/[(n-(tbo/mg))*(totl+(tbr)))], simplifying above expression leads upto simple formulation showing clear relation ie.

Since these three categories together account for \\( 25 \\) players which leaves us with \\( 50 - 25 = 25 \\) remaining members; therefore, \\( 25 \\) student choose their preference among plays musical instruments, video games.

Accordingly our next known detail comes via inference; assuming all remaining classes not involved directly but inferred through elimination processes include likes towards 'playing basketball'.

As these numbers represent distinct groups, sum them up before subtraction because none overlap; this represents all cases not explicitly mentioned as double counting another group--this calculation amounts to adding 'bakers,' 'players,' and potential tripled counts ('musicians') which equals to 10+5+(x*2), while deducting it results only once times itself due its inclusion thrice during initial addition phase [total_noback=summation-(doublet)*initial]. Subsequently identify unknown variable representation within solution formulation.
