Multiplying those by the pay rate of each job ($1.20), we find out what his daily earnings would equalize ((150*$1.2)/(daily)). Consequently this means $(1.2)*(150)=$180 income every single working day. When multiplied again by seven representing all the weeks or rather one complete business month (assuming here no holidays fall upon him), we calculate the whole sum as being worth exactly $((($180/week) * (the_total))=$<<1.2*(150=180)>>$). Hence assuming zero holidays within such fourteen calendar days period; We therefore deduce that the actual amount earned over a stretchy duration equivalenting precisely three successive periods ranging upwards towards nearly twenty individual nonstop operating hours during said timeframe amounts exactly toward $((($180 / hour)(14days)))$.
