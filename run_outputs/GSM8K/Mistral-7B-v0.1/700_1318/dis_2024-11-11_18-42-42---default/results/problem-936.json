Instead of taking longer than necessary, Cameroon can choose to take advantage of lower rates and spend less by choosing one night over four plus half a night which ends up equalling three full long time slots worth just as much per dollar spent. Here we calculate what price equals out again using our chosen prices above divided into same amounts like before--for both options being equal priced yet different times paid within limits set forth earlier such their sum matches those established ones exactly thereby making these choices seemingly affordable even though sometimes cheaper depending upon circumstances/desired spending patterns among others alike .

At the cost per extra hour charge ($70/hr), this adds up as follows: 10*$70=$<<10*70=700>>700.

Adding onto this amount costs extra; so those three remaining hours cost 3 x 70 = <<3*70=210>>210 pesos. Therefore if not charged extra beyond midnight (which wasn\u2019t asked), since it was within these initial available times without surcharges, he just needs to pay additionally only for what exceeds normal period until leaving which can be computed as below. As such, regular price remains unchanged up through full interval hence equals 1000 pesos initially plus no charge thus continues exactly till last checkout time before any post intervals come into play.
