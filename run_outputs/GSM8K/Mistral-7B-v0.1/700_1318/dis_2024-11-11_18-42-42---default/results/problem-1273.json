Thus we need to first reinstate all the ones taken because every time someone takes out something it means its also being split back into twice so instead what would really happen here is Dallas receives not 21+4=25 items(bags/marbles) rightfully through this transaction however since no mention of splitting overly indicates sharing among both children equally; therefore considering such implications leads us towards calculating half based solely upon shared quantities amongst pairs until further specification arises making calculations easier due fewer unknown variables involved when applying principles involving even distribution while maintaining fairness throughout said actions according provided context thereby offering plausible alternatives within framework allowing clearer interpretation without having conflicting premise inconsistencies affect overall logical reasoning process thus avoiding misinterpretations stemming potentially resulting conflicts concerning original intentions behind certain proposed statements specifically regarding equitable considerations needed during exchange dealings alike described earlier noted above Here goes our calculation ; To determine quantity mazia distributes fairly hence equals ((Dallas_before)-4)/2 This can easily evaluate via plugging numbers already presented yielding result 18 We deduce amount assigned Darsal equalizes accordingly achieving balance similarly calculated yet using inverse operation subtract ending sum achieved yields same specific value determined initially leading confirmation reaching conclusion : Both receive approximately identical amounts assuming prior conditions remain unaltered As previously indicated correct methods allow comprehension despite potential confusion associated issues mentioned requiring analytical skills applicable situation likewise necessitated critical thinking abilities demanded successfully resolving ambiguities encountered along way prompting deeper understanding encompassing relevant concepts required completing task effectively ensuring desired outcome attained precisely matching specified requirements Therefore utilizing simplified expressions simplifies computation whilst simultaneously preserving fundamental relationships inherent conceptual basis facilitating resolution clarity ultimately obtainable solution remains consistent regardless circumstances adjustments made alter parameters directly impact derived results modifying dynamics influencing factors subsequently changing expected consequences unless explicitly accounted modifications accommodated accurately reflected changes occurrences adherence maintained crucial element assurance sustaining integrity foundational tenets dictating accurate execution paramount essential success fulfillment guarantee effectiveness efficiency optimization accuracy precision congruence harmony coherence integration interoperability compatibility uniformity coordination synergistic efficacy achievement accomplishment objectives aspirational",

Hence, since Maizi distributed equally among both children, Darla would also get 17 marbles during distribution too. Thus, out of original collection of 52, if you add the remaining amounts together; it equals 48(Dallas) + 17(Darla) or 65 altogether. However this exceeds initial count so therefore assuming no loss occurred due to transferring into new hands ,therefore mazie didn\u2019t divide these 65 perfectly equal as either child might received less than fair share .

We know Dallas ended up having a total of 21 marbles; before taking out four into the ground this means Dallas received 21+4=25 original new ones. Since mazie only divided what remains among herself (not countd as any), all remaining amounts equals twice that one which belongs to either D or D again minus themselves...which therefore becomes(52-(Dallas_received*2)-Darla)...and since Dallas still gets same amount/half of whatever wasn't destroyed....that leads us here:  52 -(25x2) -> 52-(50)->-4!.....so both share equal shares unless otherwise specified ;) .

And this means that mazie actually gave darla only half of what remains so if you take away all remaining of those boys(which would leave us nothing), your original numbers stay still but divided into halves making each group receive just one out every pair resulting in exactly half or rather simply; Darla receives precisely 29/2=<<52*2-(4*(26))>>11 marbles. But wait! We want whole numbers not fractions right?. Well, when dividing items equally amongst friends using integers as answers doesn't result perfectly due to remainder always being involved no matter how close division results may look like. This reminder needs accountance hence round down instead towards floor function .

        " before he loses any when he drops them into the sandbox which means Mazie initially divided all Marbles (which amounted up to  52) equally among Dallas and Darla or split it so evenly as possible .That leaves either one or three extra ones if you don\u2019t know this , but because we can rule out one since only four was lost not seven (three would leave him having still over half remaining), I am going to go through both scenarios here first : When splitting everything equally ,Dallas could receive anything else than odd numbers right ? Since no fractions exist;we start checking every other integer sequence starting form zero(zero excluded as i suppose everyone likes something better). We find the following pairs ; [1 & 51], [2 & 50]...[etc.. ], [26&26]. Outer limit reached -> move next pair forward ! .... Next set starts immediately again ..moving another six values ahead ...and finally reaching back exactly upon same initial partner [[52/2]]=<b>[26 ]</b><br/>Thus Dale ended holding {{formatnum:21}} while getting {{{text|26}}}}. Finally finding these exact figures confirms our supposition above about equalizing division being what happened indeed.(Amazingly enough...) This allows us confirming directly without further calculation those few details mentioned earlier regarding surpluses leaving just calculating difference !!

        " his current amount:  21 (marbles) - 4 (dropped marbles) equals what we get before he lost any which means Dallas initially received double this because it was split among him & darla so multiply 2*21=42 marbles. This means mazie distributed all but four marblees(2+2), hence subtracting 4 leaves us with 52 original quantity minus these remaining marbles i.e.,\t52-(42+4)=52-46 or simply calculate distributing half first :(52/2) as initial distribution ,which gives same result if you take away last drop scenario into account .
