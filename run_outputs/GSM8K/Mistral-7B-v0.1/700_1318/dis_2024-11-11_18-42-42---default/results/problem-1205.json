Therefore , it appears only ~~half~~ almost certainly requires less than this but still just above exactly enough based simply upon distribution criteria provided here! We see none satisfies precisely double yet also slightly lower values simultaneously without contradiction nor conflict which seems quite reasonable considering potential random daily variances even within seemingly consistent averages over time periods measured differently like weeks vs months compared amongst animals possibly being fed similarly whether food consists mainly whole grains versus processed ones while doing things such playing fetching games back& forth inside home instead outside amidst nature environments away etc..
