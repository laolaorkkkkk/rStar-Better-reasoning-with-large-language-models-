        " that's (1/3) * 12 = 4 birds gone. That leaves us with 12 - 4 = 8 birds still unafraid. Later, another group comes along; this time it consists of 20 new friends joining the remaining birds \u2013 bringing up our count again to 8 original plus these fresh recruits which totals 8 + 20 = 28. Hence there would be twenty-eight birds hanging around Jeremy\u2019s cozy birdhouse domain post reunion! The answer is: 28.",
        " (because 12 divided by 3 equals 4) remaining. That means initially Jeremy sees only those who weren't afraid; thus it was also just like having original count minus these frightened ones which sums up as well to 12. This brings us into initial condition again but no change since all feathers flew south or west wind blew eastwards keeping the bird distribution same hence leaving counts unaltered. Adding another twenty sightings wouldn\u2019t alter our equation because this doesn't relate directly either time context wise nor population dynamics wise \u2013 instead implying merely additional observations made afterwards making cumulative result non impacting preexisting value(as newcomers). To calculate what occurs next however lets incorporate data regarding arrival times herewith : first batch observed includes full group plus newly arrived bunch post encounter ; second instance refers solely towards latter collection size i.e., sum excluding prior cohort inclusive within earlier sampling interval whilst third period embodies whole roster sans previously sampled specimens regardless whether presence during initial capture still prevails even if transient absence happened throughout observation sequence otherwise assumed temporary migration habits rendering current figure unaffected upon subsequent surveying effort under present study framework thereby suggesting negligible fluctuation rate irrespective preceding activity patterns pertaining fowl attendance ratio shift occurrences elsewhere independent influence potentially contributing minimal variance deviations despite incremental increase via addition following disjoint episodes conducted independently aside temporal considerations specific locality peculiarities distinct populations interactions consequent dynamic interplay factors inherently variable across diverse environments necessitating granular examination methodologies catering particular idiosyncratic conditions encountered pertinent research objectives being explored subject matter domain requiring further detailed assessments beyond simple aggregative quantitative analysis techniques employed commonly adopted mainstream investigatory protocol typically lack sophisticated depth sought aiming comprehensive encompassing insightful holistic viewpoint appreciating nuanced multi facet complex variables interact synergistically influencing collectively determining overall outcomes reflect multilayered integrative systemic processes intrinsic nature fundamentals shaping organism behavior adaptability responses adjustment survival strategy optimization ensuring sustainable existence equilibrium delicate balances orchestrating life cycles perpetually progress cycle continuum maintain natural order govern fundamental principles operating governing laws preserving harmony unity cosmos entirety existential reality manifest human experiences understanding purpose potential fulfill destiny unfold universe possibilities boundlessly limit",

Thus , take quarter fraction which leaves us  \u00bc*12=3(the rest remains). Next, add up both fractions using addition operation : thus combining these figures yields  12-(\u2153*12)+20 birds remaining hence summing upto all bird species within our set environment.. i.e., when counted altogether => { 12 \u2013 \u2154\u00d712+ 20} ~~=>~~>>>(this represents complete population gathered inside garden enclosure considering above scenarios & calculation steps mentioned ).
