Therefore we multiply them because it tells us \u201cfor every dollar\u201d i.e., multiplying these ratios would result into our desired amount which comes out equal to   $. His second transaction mentions the sale price here also being calculated through division thus indicating proportionality but no multiplication factors nor units therefore just keeping everything else same hence leaving only dividing factor causing change within proportion yielding    Price_$=Price_(sqm)*dividedFactor*(areaPerDollar)=($2/$sqrt{50})*.1*(80*$sqrt{50})\u2248$12+(-$2)=\\u20ac10 .
