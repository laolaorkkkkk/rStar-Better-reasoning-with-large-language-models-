Substituting known values(.[-('group alpha'-X')]/ X%)='team finders'; because those results belonged equally to them alone based upon original distribution scheme provided.)

Solution lies elsewhere perhaps unbeknownst yet...but hopefully sufficient guidance rendered sufficiently comprehensible even w/out delving deeper contextually meaningless particularities surrounding exactitude sought henceforth..:) Anyway enjoy solving! :) Your approach seems overly complex for such a simple calculation.
