Second alternative approach considers additional case based options beyond original problem statement\u2026as per usual.. :-):                --i mean basically dividing everything up according different possibilities         such as             --> [(a)&(&b)]              or          |           ---->[(c&d)|((e)->f)*g]->            Just keep simplifying till you reach single expression representing probability itself ; )*_*)).

We find ourselves getting caught up in nitty gritty details once again \u2014but thankfully thanks friends :) That said , looking closer perhaps combining them somehow could shed light upon clearer understanding ? I guess checking things via simulation maybe helpful ?? Ok ok time saved already enough why not try something like Monte Carlo Method possibly helping avoid errors due complex arithmetic calculations involved ~:) Good luck buddy !!

Of these cases, we need to account for both scenarios when either no students get an extension or even without them getting extensions, Marcus gets one because his dog 'ate it'. This second case further breaks down into subcases; firstly, not every student manages an extra time frame despite absence of their substitute -- this occurs twice as frequently as him personally being able to obtain said exemption i.e., only 2 times out of three instead of half like other factors might contribute towards it resulting in just over half(50%).
