Doing this calculation gets us 2*10=20. Thus we know there are 20 eggs in the other (second) basket. To find out all eggs combined into single unit just add up these egg quantities : Adding them would mean adding their individual values resulting in sum; ie., Total Egg Count equals Summationof Egg Count per basket , i.e.(First Basket+Second Bucket)=10+(20)=20+10 . Perform such summations leading to Final ",

Therefore; First basket+Second Basket=Total Number of Eggs Combined Total quantity of egg units can therefore represented mathematically using addition operations as follows : 10(first basket)+20(second basket)=total ",

Combine these totals into their respective entities ('put them altogether'). Addition yields \\(10+20\\). Thus, combining all amounts/numbers results in a collective value of \\[(basket~one)+(basket~two)=10+(20)=\\boxed{30}\\]. This means there would be \\(\\text{three tens}\\) (\\(\\frac{3}{1}\\)) combined quantities if placed side by side because ten groups (*each representing* twenty items) makes thirty when laid out sequentially.*Remember, this type of thinking isn\u2019t limited strictly to egg collections \u2013 apply accordingly!
