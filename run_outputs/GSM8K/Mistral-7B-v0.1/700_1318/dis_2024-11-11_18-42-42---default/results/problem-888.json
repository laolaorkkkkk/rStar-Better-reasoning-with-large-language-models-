To find out if both quantities are divisible by one another determine whether dividing first amount (the numerator), here being the 50 cookies, by second quantity(denominator i.e.,five). Thus yielding equals fifth remainderless since no decimal points emerge confirms perfect partitionation among vessels leaving behind zero residue.
