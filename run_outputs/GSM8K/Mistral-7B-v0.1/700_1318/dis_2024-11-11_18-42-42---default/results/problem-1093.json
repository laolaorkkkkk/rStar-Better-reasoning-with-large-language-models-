Good luck everybody ^_^* Thank you again guys Hopefully next time someone posts their problems directly towards us instead just saying HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM WHICH INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED WEEKS BEFORE THE TEST SINCE NO ONE SEES EVERYTHING TOOL TIME AND RESEARCH IS CONSUMED GOODBYE YALL MAKE MUCH FUNNIESS ;) Happy Solving Everyone ... ~Kaplan\ud83d\ude0a @matthewdavidchou Can somebody tell me whether i solved correctly please help?????
