Since initially there was only one set or 'pair', when this double gets turned into three people per pair/set of friends (- so triplication), there would still exist just as many couples but instead turn into groups of three. This happens because if you add 2 new members onto all pairs(n=original amount)/sets rather than individual people ,then the outcome stays identical n+n .
