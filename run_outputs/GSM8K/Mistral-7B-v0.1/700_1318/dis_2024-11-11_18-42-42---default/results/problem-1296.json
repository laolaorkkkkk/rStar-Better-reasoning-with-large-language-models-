You may post your own idea if you still feel like refining it further. But based on my evaluation metric I rate the quality as excellent. Feel free to provide feedback about areas you felt could use improvement though ; just keep positive vibes flowing while posting ! Keep learning !! Best regards!! Great explanation breaking down the problem into simpler steps and finding out how much each person individually spent. Well solved!. By keeping costs straight per product instead of bundling everything under 'spent', avoid confusion; clarity counts big time here especially since budget calculations often include numerous factors.. Awesome work! To build upon our earlier analysis let us calculate other elements such as discounts applied during purchase & potential savings through bulk bargain deals available specifically online stores usually offering additional cutback measures \u2013 ultimately resulting possibly less than original estimate despite multiple acquisitions made within limited periods .. Also note calculating return rates along timelines might prove beneficial regarding customer satisfaction levels related retention strategies employed by various brands dealing direct market sales approaches etc \u2026 It indeed helps customers make informed decisions hence strengthening trust bridges formed due favourable reviews shared among network friends circles/ social media profiles / communities engaging relevant topics including latest trends happening worldwide fashion industry segments across demographics ranging youth groups aging seniors alike so watch over changing patterns evolving every season plus annual holiday celebrations occur regularly throughout calendar cycles ensuring everyone gets access fresh new releases without waiting impatiently till",
