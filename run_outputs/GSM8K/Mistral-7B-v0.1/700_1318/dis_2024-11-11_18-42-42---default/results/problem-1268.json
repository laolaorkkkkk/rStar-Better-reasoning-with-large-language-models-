Set up and solve linear equations using all available data to calculate remaining variables i.e., calculating the count of other colored units making part of it; later substituting these values back into your main equation or expression revealing desired quantity among components comprising whole unit/structure etc.; likewise determining counts across subparts having significance towards overall solution thereby ensuring completeness throughout process until definitive outcome(means sum totals match those provided). Number words imply numerical relationships within context therefore interpreting them meaningfully helps decompose complex problems effectively enabling logical & systematic resolution methods leading toward accurate results without superfluous steps reducing computation overhead considerably while maintaining coherence wtih original source narration . Here we understand three colors constitute entirety whereas only partial quantities specified resulting necessity incorporation specific algebraic rules allowing conversion quantifiers based upon stated ratios hence forming fundamental basis relationality amongst constituent segments governing collectively influencing combined aggregate measures ultimately reconciling disparities exhibited thus rendering holistic representation valid against premises established earlier providing confidence regarding precision achieved concerning sought entity classification category namely 'red block'.

Subtract both these values away simultaneously : Blue Blocks+Yellow Blocks=Total Number Of Blocks\u2212Red Blocks , ie., Red_Blocks=(Blue_Blocks\uff0b(Twice As Many~As ~Blue))-(Totalself). Using algebra techniques replace variables with corresponding numerical expressions wherever necessary ; calculate resultant value through standard mathematical procedures like addition/subtraction etc.. You get your solution when equate any expression within parenthesis having same term names together which results upon simplifying further steps would lead back onto yourself!

        " first because we know these quantities already. There are four times the amount of blue blocks so this makes it four blue block multiplied by three (three color categories).

        " which also means there are 32-(4+8)=20 red ones. Hence, it can say that if we subtract both counts (blue, yellow) what remains would correspond only to those being red hence making them equal to 20; It can be concluded without using complex calculations or operations that because these last numbers refer directly into one color group while their predecessors contribute equivalently totalling up together another specific sum i.e., no further steps needing computation but just deduction leading immediately to the numerical result of this particular situation namely \u2018red\u2019 counting having yielded exactly \u2013 20!
