Since we know granma wants half this amount when consuming medium sized jello bars; therefore, divide 75/2 which returns us twenty seven point five or approximately thirty eight units since you cannot consume part of another unit. We conclude Granna needs less than these thirty eight medium jellybeans. Therefore, multiplying three times ten yields equal amounts means sixteen additional units. Consequently, fifteen nineteen jellybean quantities equate twelve sixty fourteen plus eighteen extra portions due again being smaller compared to what was needed initially using larger variants hence leaving out only seventeen jellybeans required if all sizes match perfectly.
