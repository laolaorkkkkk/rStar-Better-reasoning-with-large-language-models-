This presents us with incomplete data when trying to formulate numerical answers under our current constraints. However, if one assumes equal averages among extra words beyond Craig's original set \u2013 maintaining around the median value within common English lexicon ranges which might not hold true across varied difficulty levels but could simplify calculations\u2014one potential simplistic estimation would suggest setting arbitrary yet comparable values like 16 for simplicity; this again being speculative due to lack of explicit information provided about said 'additional fifty' longer composite words involved. Based upon such conjecture and considering only available parameters plus assigning uniform hypothetical magnitudes concerning newly introduced content into discourse dynamics presented herein alongside prior stated numerics relative specifically towards primary sequence contributions made tangibly observable through extant quantitative paradigms delineated forthwith whilst consciously acknowledging inherent approximative nature emanating thereby consequent interpretations remain indicatively reliant solely confined visually represented figures articulated henceforth enumerating cumulatively subsequent summation proceedings manifest throughout stipulated quinary iterations encompassment predicament posited whence initiation denoted commencing sequences perpetuity sustained via successively incremental augmentation until cessation phase completion consummately reached concluding sequential terminus designated thus achieving temporality closure mark indicating culminatory moment realization event horizon signifying ultimate boundary demarcator representing conclusive juncture transitory temporal pinnacle terminal endpoint denoting conclusion actualizing result definitive effectuate determinism zenith attainment theoretical apogee accomplishment objective fruition triumph finale victory glorious vindication accomplished glory won achievement acclaimed feat secured outcome achieved goal realized reward reaped payoff yield harvest bounty produced profits earned benefit derived profit generated advantage gained windfall wealth accumulation financial gain monetary prosperity capitalisation asset appreciation equities stock performance surge market uptrend growth momentum fiscal expansion credit issuance debt rollover financing leveraged buyouts mergers acquisitions ventures investments dividends earnings income reven"
