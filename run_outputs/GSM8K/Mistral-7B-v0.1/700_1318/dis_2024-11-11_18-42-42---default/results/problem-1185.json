        " size (number) per slice times pie. Since one whole cheese pizza contains twelve slices divided further it can cover six portions; thus you would only need three full Cheese Pizzas as such; i.e., 12 /(6*Pie)=2 Pie servings which translates to half a serving or just under half a piece because we cannot get part of our desired quantities when ordering food/baked goods like this due to baking constraints.\r",
        " 6 (friends) x 6 (slices/friend) = 36 cheese pizza slices needed. Since one cheese pizza contains 12 slices, divide the amount required by the number provided per pie; therefore you get 36 / 12= 3 cheese pizzas necessary. Similarly calculate it out for Pepperoni Pizza . Each person needs 4 slices which totals up to 24 slices altogether(considering all six people). With 8 slices available everytime , this results in calculating as follows :  24 Cheeseburger slices divided by 8 slices equals   3 servings or cheeses burger pizzas To find total quantity we simply add those values obtained individually i.e., 3+3=6 Thus kate requires buying a minimum of Six Pizzas Total ",
        " There are 8 slices per pepperoni pizza and Kate's friends will eat 4 slices each. So, there will be a total of  4 X 6= 24 pepperoni pizza slices eaten. Find out which type requires fewer pizzas since it determines how many whole pizzas you can get even if one part doesn't use up all portions. Since each friend consumes equal numbers (i.e., no fractional pie), divide both totals by their respective slice count; dividing the required amount consumed amongst people means lesser or equivalent quantity depending upon size of pizza i.e whether bigger(pepperoni)piece counts as same calorie/nutritional benefit as smaller piece counted towards nutrient requirement.\r Let us see what we obtain . Divide the desired consumption within your available options , therefore : Cheesy division results in 72 / 12 = 6 pizzas needed while Peppery segment yields 24 / 8 = 3 pizzas necessary but remember any 'leftover portion', regardless of its nature --whether veggie based like mushrooms etc,--or meat oriented like garlic knots--should not influence decision process ; ignore them ! We don't consider these because ingredients vary across brands & suppliers thus affecting comparable cost values associated w/in particular range bound under specific economic conditions . Keeping costs factor constant here allows ignoring such variables due diligence aspect leaving only simple arithmetic operations involved henceforth.. No!

        " will be a total of 4 x 8 = 32 pepperoni pizza slices eaten. Divide both amounts by their respective slice counts to find out how many whole pizzas are needed: Cheese Pizza Slices / Per Piece Cheese => 72 / 12 = 6 Pepperoni Pizza Slices / Per Piece Pepperoni => 32 / 8 = 4 Therefore, Kate needs 6 (for cheese) plus another 4 (pepperoni), which equals 10 pie(s). The answer is: 10.",
        " totals together; this tells us 72+32=104 which means we would need half again as much since you can not feed people whole numbers of pizzas (therefore double it).
