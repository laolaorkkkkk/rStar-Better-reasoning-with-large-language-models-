        " of 2000 apples as well as stated it uses standardized packaging (bags). To figure out the exact value just look into quantity/volume which refers all these parameters together. Hence we calculate following equation: BagCount=TotalQuantity/BasketSize -->  BagCount = TotalApples / BatchPerEachBatch -->   2000 Apples / Packages(perBundle)of EachPackage[size 10] ->      \\frac{2K}{\\Delta}.Here K denotes Apple Count ,\\Omega stands for Package Size [in Bundle],and \\Psi represents Revenue($). By simplification; We can conclude Price=\\frac {Pk}{D}=\\frac{\\frac{Price}{Product}\\times Quantity }{N} .We know Pk$ equals to ROS$, Product Per Unit cost=$CPU$; QequalsTo Amount SoldOnDay$(Q); NstandardsizeInEveryPackage$.
