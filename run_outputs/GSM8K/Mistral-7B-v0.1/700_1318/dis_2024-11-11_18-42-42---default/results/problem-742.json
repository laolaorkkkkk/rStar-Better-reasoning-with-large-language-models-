        " says it's 40%. Calculate the actual number of girl students per one group (or class) using this equation : Number_of_Girls/Number_of_Students*Total Students= Percentage_of_girls Given these values you get ((40/100)*X)=((x)). Simplifying gets us .4 X =(number_of_students). This means 2*(number_of_students)/5 or just n/(n+m). Using algebra we find out that m equals n squared minus 80 over n so when we substitute all our variables we know N stands for both groups therefore M=(N^2)-80 As such plugging back into earlier formula yields (.2)(M)+(N) which ultimately results as follows:(.2)[(n^2 - 80)]+(n) Or equivalently;.2[((x)^2)-80] + [x]. Plugging any whole value greater than equal too 1 lessened until true equality emerges would yield what I found being  2[(y^(2))-80]+ y Wherein reality if every possible solution was checked via computer program like PARI /GP but not me!
