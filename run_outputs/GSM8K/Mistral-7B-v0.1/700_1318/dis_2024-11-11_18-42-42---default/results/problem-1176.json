Given our starting point was half foot(.5 feet*)old chip*, what remains would actually translate into just removing another quarter of the current size leaving behind .375*.

Determine whether said limit exists within stated constraints.. Calculate the daily usage rate required under normal circumstances once again; i.e., always using exactly 20%.
