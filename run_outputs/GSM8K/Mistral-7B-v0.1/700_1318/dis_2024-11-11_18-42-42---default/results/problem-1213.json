However since our calculation only covers a single payment plan which doesn't go beyond twelve months hence considering no further compounding. Determine the portion being returned every month using simple math division operation i.e ,($6+$300) /$2*11=$15/month$. It implies during first eleven months; Stephens pays back part amounts worth $((300+6)*1)=$306 altogether across these periods. At last subtract what Stephen already put aside through various installments against debts . His balance still stands as follows,(300+6)-((25*(n))+(x)), n represents number od times when stephen makes timely payoff while X denotes value of remainder yet outstanding so substitute respective values obtained above such as ((306-$25*11), thus you get your correct required answer.(X=-$(306-275)).
