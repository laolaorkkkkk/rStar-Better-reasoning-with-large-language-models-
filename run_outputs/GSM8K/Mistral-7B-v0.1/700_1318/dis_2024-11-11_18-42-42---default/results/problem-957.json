Instead you can say something like this : Assuming all children develop normally regarding age appropriate mental capabilities,, roughly correlate these developmental milestones .

Here goes one possible explanation integrating both themes while maintaining coherence: Imagine our Solar System having undergone substantial variations over long periods \u2013 these include alterations involving planets moving closer to or further away from their respective stars due to gravitational forces enacted upon the bodies within system boundaries (e.g., asteroid belts influencing Mars orbit through mass relocation events known colloquially amongst astronomers as \u2018Planet Vigorous Maneuverings'). As celestial objects journey across space influenced by various natural processes\u2014from massive collisions shifting trajectories radically leading potentially catastrophic outcomes affect all constituent components involved directly; thus any significant modifications applied externally trigger internal responses depending primarily whether external factors induce disruptive dynamics capable instigating critical transitions among existing equilibria\u2026 Translated simply: Over vast epochs spanning billions of years since formation commenced via accretion disk phenomena generating protoplanet cores progressively coalescing into major solar entities comprising Sun itself coupled its surrounding retinue dominantly residing near heliocentrical centers govern regulated velocities yield predictable periodic alignments relative counterparts throughout stelliferous environments thereby forming recognizable patterns characterized frequently referred respectively either cyclical motions depicted specifically identified sequences called milankovitch precessional adjustment models dictating terrestrial axial spin rates modification interval timelines hence ultimately intertwining correlating effects pertaining climatologic vicissitudes experienced successive ice ages scenarios documented arch",
