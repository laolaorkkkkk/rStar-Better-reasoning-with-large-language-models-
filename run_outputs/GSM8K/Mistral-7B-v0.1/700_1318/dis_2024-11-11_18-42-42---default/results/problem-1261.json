Instead focus solely upon computing individual numbers first before any summations occur thus solving algebra problems easier! Knowing specifically whether things change monthly might help simplify matters slightly however right away calculating without considering changes isn''t recommended because variables could shift constantly across different periods making precise estimations impossible otherwise Therefore once again please refer directly toward simple arithmetic operations using basic rules described below..

Each item costs (assuming only one cost applies per type): 5x$5=$25 for all blouses;  2x$8=$16 for both pairs of trousers ,and finally     1x$6= $6    Costs sum up as follows:     Total bill amounts comes out:$25+$16+$6=$47 .

        " At a cost of $5/blouse, this comes out as (5*5) =$25; ($8)(2 pairs)=($16); And ($6)($1skirt). Adding these amounts together yields $25+$16+$(6)=(47)$. Since we want costs over 5 weeks only multiply $(47)$ times 5 which equals $(235)$. Therefore, the answer is : 235.",
        " corresponding cost as well (Blouse=$5.00; Skirt=$6.00; Pant= $8.00). We can use multiplication since these costs apply uniformly across all identical items within their category i.e., ($5*5 Blouses) or ($8*2 pairs of pants) etc.. Let\u2019s calculate individual charges first . First, we need to find out the single price charged for every piece individually :   Cost_per_blouse = $5/blouse ,    Cost_per_skirt = $6/pant ,     Cost_per_pair_of_pants =$8/pant ; Therefore using above formulas let us add up our numbers according below calculation::   Single Total Price = Cost_Per_Piece(Type)*Number Of Pieces Per Type ..This formula applies when calculating any part needed while determining totals...Now lets substitute values into it one item group wise ..We get following calculations :-For Each Week:-SingleTotalPriceOfClothesBoughtOnWeekOne:=CostPerPiece(${cost_per_blouse})*{pieces of {clothes:$_{number\\_of\\_items:%_(different__types)}$}}+....All similar steps till here ...Here goes Calculation Part--->Into Second Formula As mentioned before All Cloth Items Bought Over Any Number Time Period Is Same Here Its only differencetotheOnlyVariableChangingOverTimeIs 'TimesPeriodBeingConsidered',asMentionedBefore so That Value Would Be ${n} Times ....So substitutig Values And Running Final Calculations Given Below Combining Both Formulas From Previous Step&Substitution With New Variable n===>${nTOTALCLOTHESCOST}={singletotalprice@weekone}$x{${(timesperiodbeconsrinderd)}};Naming This LastEquationGiving OutputAs "
