Each girl can produce up to four litters within this time frame since it lasts all twelve moths ((3 mths / litter times 4 nuts per litter). With ten girls, their potential contributions would equal twice as high [(number of original girls multiplied by possible reproductive rate] or [ten women \u00d7 eight squirrel cubs]. Total additions made throughout these thirty six cycles equals eighteeny squirrellings (total increases).
