        " food before discount. Similarly, it says one (red) fruit basket costs $18. Calculate the cost of buying three (3) Basket(s). Next, identify what item receives the reduction ($x or y values). Here we see every Red Fruit Basket gets 'two dollar less'(their price reduces due to Discount). Lastly calculate Total Cost as per formula; `Total_Cost=cost+reduction`. Remember this equation doesn\u2019t include quantities when solving like terms. We already solved items individually without considering quantity hence these can safely skip here! Also note no need parentheses since multiplying comes prior over addition & subtraction.(multiplication occurs first within nested brackets followed later outside all those sets),but division follows along order operations rules unless mixed w/addition OR multiplication alone such case requires parenthesis around entire operation chain except its innermost set !

        " Calculate the discount per bushel of red fruit using this information: You receive a dollar amount reduction (the \"$\" symbol) followed directly by another set of numbers (\"$x\"). Thus $ means subtracting X... Therefore we take the original value ($18), apply the subtraction operator (-$), which signifies taking away or removing something.

        " problem says you purchased three (3) sets worth of both types of fruit; first identify what constitutes a 'set.' Each set consists of one basket of green food and one of red food since it was not otherwise specified. Determine how much discount applies per purchase. You said this occurs when buying items individually but as part of a 'set,' only the most expensive item gets reduced i.e., just apply the special condition once here because we are dealing with identical quantities of these fruits being ordered together so no double bonus reduction applicable under usual circumstances. Calculate overall expense without applying any reductions yet . That would mean adding all four individual prices which totals up ($25+$18)+($25+$18)+($25+$18)=$228 ; or alternatively multiply units times price points & add those values back again -- [(PriceXQuantity)/(Set)]+[(Another PriceY)(Second Set Quantity)]. This figure represents your preliminary spending before deduction , thus establishing grounds/baseline against comparison w/postdiscount amount. Subtract relevant savings based upon stated criteria : As every second instance requires saving twice over initial pricing structure while rest maintain original rates leading us towards (-x)-(-y); Wherein '-xi', signifies saved sum due solely attributed toward lower tier offering whereas '', corresponds directly relatable term denoting additional monetary outlay specifically earmarked explicitly within provided framework henceforth utilized during comparative analysis process ultimately deriving absolute net spendable resource allocation following application accordingly considering potential marginal offset applied exclusively through selective purchasing stratagem adherence parameters stipulated above rendering resultant equation ...
