        " annually on shoe purchases; this information indicates every single purchase counts toward our overall expenditure calculation (no need to divide among months). Given James acquires precisely twice as many outfits per calendar period (each three times), it would follow logically if we split said annual sum evenly amongst these transactions. Thus dividing $2640 by six equals approximately $440, which implies individual apparel pricing approximates about $440 / 2 or around **$220** ($440 divided by the quantity purchased\u2014two) per item unit price when considering any variation based upon fluctuations due solely to possible changes influenced directly by time progression over distinct periods throughout different seasons across years unaccounted elsewhere within data provided herein but rather inferred exclusively through deduction regarding implied seasonal relevance potentially influencing prices associated purely temporally sans additional contextual factors affecting cost variabilities outside explicit temporal confines set forth further beyond scope delineated via document content constraints exclusive otherwise limitable unto specific localities versus generalizable applicability.)

        " annual expenditure ($2640) by the number of months (12), which equals approximately $220 spent per month. Since James purchases two pairs of shoes every month, divide this figure by 2 to find out what one pair costs; thus you get roughly around $$$110$. Therefore, it can be deduced that if we wanted to find out exactly how much he paid annually for the six individual items(two shoe purchase made over twelve months translates into six different ones purchased throughout the years), just simply multiply their quantity against cost price hence getting exact result as follows:- Six times $110 yields about  $$$$= \\$660$, matching closely but not perfectly the original sum mentioned due possibly rounding off errors during calculations process..

        " total number of shoe purchases per year (i.e., calculate his unit rate). Since James buys shoes twice every six months or once every three months throughout one full calendar year which equates to four times annually; thus divide $2640 / 4= $660 spent/purchase. To find out what price represents one purchase i.e., determine the cost of one item sold if it costs $660 when purchased together as part of group referred above we can use division because this operation deals directly with \u201cper\u201d calculations like here we want to know about quantity pricing represented through items rather than sums so let\u2019s take our found value resulting from previous computation ($660) since \u2018it was stated these units came bundled therefore no further subdivision needed.\u2019 But still , assuming individual evaluation would result into same calculation ;so performing simple arithmetic(dividing again by count): $660 / 2 =$  $ 330 .

        " cost (or price) for one pair which comes out as ($110)/(pair) times 2(pairs)=$220/month. That means it takes him only three months, if he wants enough different kinds of footwear! Therefore, the average amount he spent over those three months amounts to $(220+220+180), divide that figure by 3 equals about $206.66\\bar{6}. We can round this value up when calculating expenses since partial change is generally not allowed; so we get approximately $207 overall.
