This means for every single instance within just one full calendar cycle or 'week'. Subsequently multiply that value again $(($5.25*1)*2)$= $10.5 because he performs tasks twice as often so you need double what earned him $5.25; hence he gets twice than usual only when performing those actions twiced within same duration compared to first statement saying \u2018once.\u2019 Total sum needed here includes not simply repeating previous calculations but also duplicating them because frequency increased according into another situation mentioned above!
