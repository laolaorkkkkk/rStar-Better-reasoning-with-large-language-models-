Let \u2019 s say three months worth since both employers want diversity while promoting growth through innovation too... No real change occurs except perhaps increased output overall however its obvious also increases stress levels significantly..

That may require planning ahead well past present moment circumstances when thinking forward far beyond immediate needs alone .. We need patience therefore understanding importance properly prior even taking small steps toward achieving larger goals later instead rushing head first trying everything possible quickly without regard consideration necessary along way hence why sometimes fail miserably resulting disaster especially unsuccessful endeavours involving venture capital partnerships commonly found among startup communities worldwide usually failing sooner rather never succeed anywhere close unless serious commitments made firm decisions agreed terms signed contracts executed fully ensured successful launch finally bringing profitability potential guaranteed promised return expected results achieved successfully delivered happily satisfied pleased everybody involved happy times shared hopefully years continued prosperous future look bright looking brighter tomorrow thankfully grateful thanks glad fortune smiled face expressed smile heartfelt hug welcomed warm hello returned respect shown kindness extended courtesy granted best wishes offered congratulations accepted gratefully appreciated celebration",
