Another 7 moved in after supper which makes up this count; meaning altogether the entire house housed around<<76+30+7=113>>113 people! However, because we know initially all rooms were occupied so even these ones accounting here cannot include any new guest checking into other empty beds or compartments within the inn but just move about throughout its common facilities like waiting spaces & corridors etc., hence taking care not forgetting others staying still (unlikely though) till their designated time slot i.e.-their usual sleep periods without causing nuisance whatsoever towards peaceful slumbers either way&no additional persons can possibly enter nor leave unannounced outside due law enforcement measures especially through security cameras monitoring such entries / departures continuously across premises under normal circumstances considering possible health related risks also attached too present COVID crisis climate affecting everyone including businesses alike worldwide... Therefore our original occupancy stands strong against external intruders coming specifically aimed only regarding disruptive behaviors occurring regularly every night leaving no chance allowed anymore regardless whatever might happen overnight next weekend let alone further ahead whenever required changes occur necessitated following emergency protocol put forth immediately wherever applicable thus ensuring utmost protection available currently provided via robust management techniques employed since times immemorial whilst maintaining high standards expected above industry norms globally recognised amongst top performers competitively rating among peers locally nationally internationally round robin style assessment conducted annually based upon feedback obtained directly personally spoken face-to-face interactions taken note prior approval granted thereby authorizing staff responsible dealing matters pertaining safety concerns raised occasionally usually arising once quarterly meetings convened monthly basis involving executives direct reports supervisory teams review procedures followed internally externally third party entities providing necessary oversight services offered independently versus integrated reporting methods deployed elsewhere else typically observed mostly corporate governance frameworks implemented universally adopted standardized criteria applied consistently uniformly upheld rigoriously strictly abiding rules established governing principles respectfully advocated religious tenets preached ide",

Later night came around and another count showed(30+15) i.e.,newly registered customers together making ten folds this particular hour equals nineteen minus seven implies eighteen individuals entered further increasing occupancy levels inside premises raising the overall headcount accordingly henceforth yielding higher turnover rate within said establishment leading thus forth consequently culminating towards reaching absolute peak capacity level present amongst visitors presently located perambulating throughout facility environs subsequently signifying conclusive numerical sum indicating totaled guesthead counts effectively reflective quantitatively denoting precise figure encapsulated thereby corresponding directly relatable numerically equivalent terminus valuation amount definitively enumerated precisely expressible through succinct mathematical construct illustrative representation concretely identifiable via symbolic equation systematically arranged sequentially structured formula computation procession methodologically conducted iteratively progressive computational analysis undergone rigorously performed logistical operations meticulously recorded exhaustive tabulation activities undertaken scrupulously maintained accuracy ensuring validity veracity authenticateness integrity wholly confirmed data reliability unquestionably substantiable empirically tested facts demonstrably affirmed corroborated unequivocal assurance attained absolutely certainty indisputably guaranteed thoroughly vetted information proven beyond doubt convincing irrefutable evidence presented factually based accurate records established impeccably verified accounts certified infallible details scrutinized carefully cross-checked multiple times independently reviewed comprehensively audited repeatedly monitored constantly overseen supervised closely observed diligently examined continually reevaluated frequently revisited regularly updated kept current always freshest latest version posted last modified most recent edition published just released yesterday recently printed earlier obtained shortly acquired quickly retrieved promptly captured instantly preserved permanently archived secure longstanding permanent record officially filed formally documented properly stored organized categorized appropriately indexed accurately labelled correctly captioned charted plotted graphed detailed diagrammatically delineated mapped geometrically depicted visually represented pictorially illustrated spatially portrayed top",
        " new arrivals equals half times this count because it states 'twice as many arrived.' That means (15+x)=2*((100-(24))/2). This simplifies to (15+x) = ((76)/2), which further reduces to (15+x) = 38 . Solving for \u2018x\u2019 we subtract 15 from both sides yielding x= 38 \u2013 15 or x= 23 Guests came in before dinner, so you add these together; hence initially during the stay there would still be only (76)+(23) = 99 guests remaining when evening comes around. Adding one last guest arrives post-dinner brings us up to a grand total of 100 again! Thus the hotel currently houses exactly its original occupancy once all calculations considered including any possible fluctuation due either party departures OR ingressions since commencement of initial full capacity.

        " afternoons can be calculated as follows: (15 * 2) + 7 equals to 30+7 which yields 37 new arrivals. Adding these together shows us that initially we ended up having 76 guests remaining unchanged; adding them into our count makes it totaled 113 initial guest changes over time period specified before breakfast serving times arrived or otherwise altering attendance numbers within stated hours. Therefore if both sets meet criteria described earlier but remain unaffected until post mealtime events occur following said service offerings etc., overall headcount stands increased due just simply because occupancy rates weren\u2019t yet affected till such point considered here upon mention about 'after dinner'.

Twice fewer stayed until after their last meal which could correspond roughly to later than typical restaurant times so doubled that would suggest approx three quarters past twelve maybe four PM thus halfway point might signify six individuals choosing extended stays i.e., up till eight or perhaps even nine depending if your interpretation changes slightly regarding what counts precisely for 'after'. Also importantly add further arrival count following such events occurrences; seven arrived subsequently indicated clearly within document text itself indicating latter addition onto prior summed amounts accumulated previously noted already through multiple entries made throughout narrative discourse segment specified under headings etc contained primarily consisting ones single entry(involved person figure).

To sum up find the total occupancy rate you get initial occupied count+newly checking into(afternoon)+additional folks arriving past midnight=(morning_occupied+postnoonday_registerees).
