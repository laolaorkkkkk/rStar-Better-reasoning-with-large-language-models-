Similarly, since Wendy receives thrice whatever Claire can achieve within a certain period, This equates to 3*1=3 badges/month(as well). We know their rates, so we just need them over a set period of time i.e., herein 1year or 12 months hence let us calculate accordingly assuming all received during first order of operations before subtracting otherwise results would differ!

Since these numbers aren't provided, I can only explain conceptually rather than provide a specific numerical value due to missing information such as 'twice' or 'three times.' However, assuming 'twice' means 2x claire\u2019s rate and \u2018three times\u2019 refers directly to their respective rates without multiplications affecting across different people because individuals cannot collectively triple themselves but individually maintain personal counts which add up separately \u2013 not together making tripleness moot when comparing pairs against each other. Thus considering individual progress through set timelines independently\u2014i.e., independent tracks even within shared temporal bounds; thus no literal doubling/tripling occurs vis-\u00e0-vis comparative advantage since concurrent pursuits persist irrespective amongst peers yet singularly contributing towards absolute metrics owning unique accomplishments yield cumulative totals respectively henceforth necessitating direct multiplication upon base quantities extracted solely unto self thereby engendering disparate outputs exclusive nonlinear amplifications absent standardized interactions otherwise delineating linear relationality among distinct performatives despite superficial concurrences apparent via sequential succession over unisonous stretches spanning uniform duration intervals.
