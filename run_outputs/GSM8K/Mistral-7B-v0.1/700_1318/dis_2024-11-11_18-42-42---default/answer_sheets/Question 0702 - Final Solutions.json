Condition 3: Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Condition 4: When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary combine their trucks, they can collectively haul 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than hers. So Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds. When all three of them combine their trucks, they can haul 11,600 pounds. That means Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 2,800 pounds. The answer is: 2,800.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
