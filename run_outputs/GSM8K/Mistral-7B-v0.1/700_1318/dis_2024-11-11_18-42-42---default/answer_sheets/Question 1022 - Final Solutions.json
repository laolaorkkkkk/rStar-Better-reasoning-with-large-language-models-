Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we have c_large = 3*c_small. Also, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we have q_large = q_small/2. Lastly, the total amount earned from the sales was $120, so we have c_large * q_large + c_small * q_small = 120. Combining these equations, we have 3*c_small * q_small / 2 + c_small * q_small = 120. Solving for q_small, we get q_small = (120 / 4) * 2 = 30.

Define the cost of one large stuffed animal as c_large, and one small stuffed animal as c_small. Define the quantity of large stuffed animals sold as q_large and small stuffed animals sold as q_small. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write this relationship as q_small = 2 * q_large. We also know that the earnings were $120, and that each small stuffed animal costs $4. This means that (q_small * c_small) + (q_large * c_large) = 120. Plugging in the values for q_small and c_small, we get 2 * q_large * c_large + q_large * c_large = 120. Simplifying, we get 3 * q_large * c_large = 120. Dividing both sides by 3, we get q_large * c_large = 40. Dividing both sides by c_large, we get q_large = 40 / c_large. Since we know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we can say that c_large = 3 * c_small. Plugging this into the equation, we get q_large = 40 / (3 * c_small). To solve for q_small, we can use the relationship q_small = 2 * q_large, which becomes q_small = 2 * (40 / (3 * c_small)).
