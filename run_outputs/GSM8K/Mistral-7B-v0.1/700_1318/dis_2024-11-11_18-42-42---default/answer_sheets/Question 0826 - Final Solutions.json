We are told that 5 green eggs, 2 times as many blue eggs as green eggs, 1 less pink egg than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Let's start with the first condition, which says that there are 5 green eggs.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second condition. It tells us that the number of blue eggs is twice the number of green eggs, so we can write it as B = 2G.\n\nNext, the third condition states that there is 1 less pink egg than blue eggs. We can use this information to calculate the number of pink eggs. Since there are B blue eggs and 1 less pink egg, we can say that the number of pink eggs is B - 1.\n\nFinally, the fourth condition tells us that there is one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. We can use this to find the number of yellow eggs. Since there are B - 1 pink eggs and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, we can say that the number of yellow eggs is (B - 1) / 3.\n\nNow that we know the numbers of all the different colored eggs, we can add them up to find the total number of eggs. We know that there are 5 green eggs, B blue eggs, B - 1 pink eggs, and (B - 1)/3 yellow eggs. Adding these together gives us 5 + B + B - 1 + (B - 1)/3 = 6 + 2B - 1/3.
