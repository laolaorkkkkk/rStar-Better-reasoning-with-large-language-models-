There are also yellow cars in the rink."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. There are 12 red bumper cars available. That means there are 2 less green cars than red ones. So there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. Since the number of blue cars equals 3 times the number of green cars, we can calculate that there are 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars. We also know that there are 75 total cars in the rink, so we can subtract the red, green, and blue cars to find out how many yellow cars there are. 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 23 yellow cars.
