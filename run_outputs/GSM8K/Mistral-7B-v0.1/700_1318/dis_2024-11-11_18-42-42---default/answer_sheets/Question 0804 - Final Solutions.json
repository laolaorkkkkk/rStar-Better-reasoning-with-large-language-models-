Condition 2 states that the first car travels at 60 miles per hour. Condition 3 says that the second car travels faster and passes the first one at 70 miles per hour. Condition 4 specifies that both cars maintain their respective speeds throughout. To calculate the time it takes for the second car to pass the first one, we need to find the distance between the two cars and divide it by the speed difference (70 - 60 = 10). Let's call the distance between the two cars x miles. Since the second car passes the first one at 70 miles per hour, it will take 70/x hours.
