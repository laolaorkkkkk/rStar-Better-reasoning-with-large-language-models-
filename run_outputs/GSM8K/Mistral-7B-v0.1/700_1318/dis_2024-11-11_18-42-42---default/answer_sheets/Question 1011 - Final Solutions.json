Day two - Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she pumped on day 1, and Ms. B only pumps 1/3 of what she pumped on day 1.

We know that Wanda and Ms. B pumped water into an 18,000-gallon tank. They did this over two days. On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons. So the tank still requires 18,000 - (4,500 + 3,375 + 3,000 + 1,125) = 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons to be fully filled. The answer is: 6,000.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 5}]
