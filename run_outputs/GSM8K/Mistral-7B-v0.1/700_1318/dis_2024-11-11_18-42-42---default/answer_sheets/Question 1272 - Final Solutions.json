Since Helen took 7 bus trips, the total cost of the bus rides is 7 * 2.6 = 18.2 dollars. To find the total cost of the hotel stay and bus rides, add up the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus rides. 26 * 3 = 78 dollars for the hotel stay. 18.2 + 78 = 96.2 dollars.

The first condition states that 3 nights in the hotel cost $80. This can be written as 3 * X = 80, where X is the price per night. From the second condition, we know that every bus ride costs 10% of one hotel night. So if we take n bus trips, it will cost 10% of n nights. We can write this as (n / 10) * X. Combining the two equations, the total cost is 3 * X + (n / 10) * X. Substituting values for X, we get 3 * 80 + (7 / 10) * 80, which simplifies to 240 + 56, or 296.
