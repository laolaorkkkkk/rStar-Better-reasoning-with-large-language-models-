Condition 5:  Both worked for 20 hours. Question: How much more money will Billy earn compared to Sally, in dollars?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate Billy's starting salary: $10 per hour x 20 hours = $200"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour. After two months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour. That means his new rate was $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour. That means his current rate is $11.50 per hour. His gross pay for working 20 hours would be $11.50 per hour x 20 hours = $230.\n\nSally started at a business where her starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary. That means her starting salary was $10.50 per hour. Her gross pay for working 20 hours would be $10.50 per hour x 20 hours = $210.\n\nSo Billy earned $230 minus Sally's earnings of $210, which is $20. The answer is $20.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
