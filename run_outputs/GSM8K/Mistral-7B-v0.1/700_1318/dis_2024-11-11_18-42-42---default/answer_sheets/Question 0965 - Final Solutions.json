We need to identify what the variables are in each condition and the question. In this example, we can say that the speed is a variable in Conditions 2, 3, and 4; the time is a variable in Conditions 2, 3, and 4; and the distance traveled is a variable in Condition 4."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Condition 1 says that a bird flew from its northern home to its southern home. Condition 2 says that it flew for 10 hours southward at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Condition 3 says that it then flew for two hours northward at a speed of 18 miles per hour. Condition 4 says that finally, it flew for five hours southward at a speed of 22 miles per hour. This means that the total distance traveled by the bird was 30 * 10 + 18 * 2 + 22 * 5 = 300 + 36 + 110 = 446.
