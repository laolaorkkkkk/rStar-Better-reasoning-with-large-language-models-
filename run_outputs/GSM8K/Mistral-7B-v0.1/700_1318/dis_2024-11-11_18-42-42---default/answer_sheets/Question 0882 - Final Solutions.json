Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.

She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.\n\nSo, let us start by determining the amount of money spent on each item. Bacon costs $2 per pack, so 5 packs cost $10 in total. Chicken costs $4 per pack, so 6 packs cost $24 in total. Strawberries cost $4 per pack, so 3 packs cost $12 in total. Apples cost $2 per pack, so 7 packs cost $14 in total.\n\nNow we can calculate how much money Kelly has left in her budget. The amount spent on all the items combined is: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $50. Since Kelly's budget is $65, this means that she has $65 - $50 = $15 left in her budget.\n\nIn conclusion, if Kelly has $65 in her budget and her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, her 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon, her 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and her 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, then she has $15 left in her budget.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart.
