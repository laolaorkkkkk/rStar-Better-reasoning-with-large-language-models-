Let L represent the number of large jellyfish and S represent the number of small jellyfish. Then we can write two equations, Total = L + S, and 1/5 * Total = L. Subtracting 1/5 * Total from both sides of the equation Total = L + S gives us 4/5 * Total = S. Dividing both sides of the equation 4/5 * Total = S by 3 gives us 16/15 * Total = S. We can divide both sides by 16/15 to solve for Total, which gives us 15 * Total = S. Therefore, Total = S / 15. To find out how many jellyfish are in the tank, substitute S / 15 into the equation S = 16/15 * Total. Doing this gives us S = 16/15 * (S / 15) = 4/3 * S. Solving for S gives us S = 6.
