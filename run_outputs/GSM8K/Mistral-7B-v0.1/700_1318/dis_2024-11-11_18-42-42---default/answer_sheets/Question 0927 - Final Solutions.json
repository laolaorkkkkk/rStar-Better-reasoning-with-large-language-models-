For condition 2, normal cinnamon rolls contain 600 calories and normal blueberry muffins contain 450 calories. For condition 3, mini pastries have one-third the calorie content of their full-sized counterparts. So we can calculate the total calorie count as follows:\n\n1) Calculate the calorie counts of the two types of mini pastries. For mini cinnamon rolls, it would be 1/3 of 600 = 200. For mini blueberry muffins, it would be 1/3 of 450 = 150.\n\n2) Add them up. 200 + 150 = 350.
