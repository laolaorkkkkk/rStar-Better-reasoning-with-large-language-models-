Now, the bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 individually or $3.00 per bunch. Since a single banana costs less than a bunch of bananas, this means $0.80 is less than $3.00. Dividing 40 by $0.80, we get about 50. Therefore, Jenny pays about $0.80 for one banana. The answer is: $0.80.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What amount of savings, expressed in dollars, can Jenny expect by purchasing the bananas in bunches rather than individually?", "subanswer": {"text": "We first calculate how much Jenny would have paid if she bought the bananas individually. She buys 40 bananas, which cost $0.80 each, so she would have paid $0.80 * 40 = $32.00. Now, since a single banana costs less than a bunch of bananas, which cost $3.00 each, Jenny would have paid $3.00 * 10 = $30.00 if she bought the bananas in bunches instead. Thus, she expects a savings of $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00. The answer is: $2.00.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
