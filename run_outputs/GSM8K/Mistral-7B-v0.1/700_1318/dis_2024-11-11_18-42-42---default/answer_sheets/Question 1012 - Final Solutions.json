It was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for 5 hours and then it was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for 3 hours. The total time was 5 + 3 = 8 hours. So, the battery lost 9% of the total capacity for 5 hours. That means 9% of the total capacity is (5/8)*28% = 14%. The battery also lost 7% of the total capacity for 3 hours. That means 7% of the total capacity is (3/8)*28% = 11%. We can add up 14% and 11% to get 25%, which is less than 28% so we know there was a remaining charge greater than 25%.
