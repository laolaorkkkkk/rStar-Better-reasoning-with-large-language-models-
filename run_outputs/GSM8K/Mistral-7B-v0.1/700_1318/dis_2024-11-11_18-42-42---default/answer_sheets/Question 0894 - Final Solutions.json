Condition 1: 80 dollars is Tasha's monthly income from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Condition 2: In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as often as she did Joe's. Condition 3: During the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as frequently as she did Joe's. Condition 4: Joe pays Tasha $6 for each lawn she mows. Question: How much income from lemonade sales did Tasha generate in this time period?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "In order to answer this question, we need to calculate Tasha's earnings from both tasks: mowing lawns and selling lemonade. Let's start with the former. According to condition 1, Tasha's monthly income from selling lemonade and mowing lawns is $80. As condition 2 states, during the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as often as she did Joe's. This means that if she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's three times, which translates to six total mowings. Therefore, Tasha earned $6 (the price for each mowing) six times for a total of $36 from the first week. Moving onto condition 3, it tells us that during the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as frequently as she did Joe's. Similar to before, this means that if she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's five times, resulting in ten total mowings. Consequently, Tasha earned $6 ten times for a total of $60 from the second week. Combining these values, Tasha earned a total of $36 + $60 = $96 from mowing lawns during this time period. Finally, according to condition 4, Joe pays Tasha $6 for each lawn she mows. Since Tasha's monthly income from selling lemonade is $80, she must have generated $80 worth of lemonade sales during this time period.
