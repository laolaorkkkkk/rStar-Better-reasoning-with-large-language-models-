It says Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. She can skip at 3 miles per hour. We need to find out how many miles she can travel in 6 hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.\n\nWe can start by converting the rate of speed into time units. 3 miles per hour is the same as 3/1 hours per mile. To do this, we divide 3 by 1 to get 3 miles in 1 hour. We can also convert the percentage to decimal form. One-third is the same as 0.33, and two-thirds is the same as 0.67.\n\nNow we can calculate the distance traveled while running. Distance = Speed * Time. Run speed is four times faster than walk speed, so we need to multiply 3/1 by 0.33 to get the distance traveled while running. This gives us 1 mile.\n\nTo find the total distance traveled, we add up the distances traveled while running and walking. So the total distance is 1 mile + (3/1 * 0.67) miles = 1 mile + 2 miles = 3 miles.\n\nFinally, we can convert back to the original unit, miles per hour. Since we have a total distance of 3 miles and we know that 1 mile = 3/1 hours, we can use division to find that the average speed is 1/3 hour per mile.\n\nSo the answer is 1/3 hour per mile.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.

She runs 12 mph, which means she covers 12 miles every hour when she runs. That is because 12 miles is the amount of distance she travels in 1 hour. But this only happens when she runs. She doesn't always run. So it depends on how long she spends running versus how long she spends walking. One third of the time she runs and two thirds of the time she walks. When she spends an hour running, she covers 12 miles and she walks 12 miles. So she covers 24 miles when she spends an hour running and walking. However, she only spends one third of the time running. So she would spend 3/12, or 3 / (3 * 12) of an hour running. And she would spend the other 2/3 of an hour walking. So when she spends 1/12 of an hour running, she would cover 12 miles. She would cover 24 miles in 1/3 of an hour.

Let's solve for R. 8R / 8R = 3 / 8R. 1 = 3 / 8R. 1 * 8R = 3. 8R = 3. R = 3/8. Dana can run at 3/8 miles per hour. The problem also states that she can skip at 3 miles per hour.

When Dana runs, she travels 4 times faster than when she walks. So 4 times the distance when she walks is the same as the distance when she runs. This means that the distance she travels in one hour when she runs equals the distance she travels in four hours when she walks. Let's call the distance traveled in four hours when Dana walks W. We know that Dana can run four times as far as she can walk in one hour, so we know that Dana can run W in four hours. Dana skips at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, therefore, her speed when skipping is (1/2) * 12 = 6 miles per hour. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour, this means that it takes her three times longer to skip a mile as to run a mile. Therefore, Dana can skip three times as far as she can run in an hour. In other words, Dana can skip 3W in an hour. Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she runs for one-third of the six hours, which is two hours. Therefore, she runs 4W in the six hours. She walks the rest of the time, which is four hours. Since she can walk four times as far as she can run in an hour, she can walk W in four hours. Therefore, she walks 4W in the six hours. This means that she walks twice as far as she runs. This also means that she runs and walks twice as far as she skips. Since she skips 3W in an hour, she skips 6W in six hours. Therefore, she skips 2(4W) in the six hours. Since she skips 6W in six hours, she can skip 1/3 of 6W in two hours.
