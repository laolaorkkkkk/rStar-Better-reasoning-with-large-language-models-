To find out how much money Tommy made from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to know the price of both and the number of brownies and cheesecakes that were sold. From the hint, the price of brownies is $3 per slice and the price of cheesecakes is $4 per slice. Tommy sold 43 brownies and 23 cheesecakes. The first thing we can do is calculate the total amount of money that came from selling brownies. We already know that the price of each brownie is $3. To get the total amount from selling all 43 brownies, we multiply the price by the number. 43 times $3 equals $129. The next thing we need to calculate is how much money came from selling cheesecakes. We already know the price and the number, so we can follow the same steps we just used for calculating the amount from selling brownies. This time we will be multiplying $4 by 23 which equals $92. Now that we have the amounts for selling brownies and cheesecakes, we can add them up to get the total amount of money that Tommy made. The total amount of money made from selling brownies is $129, and the total amount of money made from selling cheesecakes is $92. When we add those numbers together we get $129 + $92 which equals $221.
