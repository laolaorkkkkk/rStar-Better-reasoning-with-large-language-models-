One pound of beeswax and the wicks costs $10.00. There are 20 pounds of beeswax, so 20 * $10 = $200. That's his total cost. Next, let's calculate the revenue. Each candle sells for $2.00. We have 20 candles, so 20 * $2 = $400. That's his total revenue. We can calculate the net profit as follows: net profit = total revenue - total cost.
