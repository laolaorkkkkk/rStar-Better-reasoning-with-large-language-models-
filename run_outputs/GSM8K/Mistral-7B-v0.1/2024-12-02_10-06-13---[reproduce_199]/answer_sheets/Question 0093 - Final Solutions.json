We are told that Lee can run 400 meters in x seconds, while Gerald could run 400 meters in x+2 seconds. This means the initial difference was 2 seconds.\n\nNext, we are told that Gerald improved his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. To calculate this improvement, we multiply Gerald's initial time (x + 2) by 1.1 (10% increase). This gives us Gerald's new time: (x + 2) * 1.1 = x + 2.2.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles, given his new time and the information about Lee's time. Since Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in x seconds and Gerald's new time is x + 2.2 seconds, this means Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in x + 2.2 - x = 2.2 seconds.

Gerald improved his speed by 10% (from his original). Let's call Gerald's new speed g. Lee's initial speed was l. Then l = g + 2. And Lee's new speed is l - 10%. 10% of l is 0.1l. To find g: g = l - 0.1l = l(1 - 0.1) = l * 0.9 = l / 1.1. If we plug in l = g + 2, we get g / 1.1 = g + 2. Solving this equation, we get g = 36.
