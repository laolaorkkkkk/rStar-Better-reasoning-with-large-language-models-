This means that 40% of the boys are in the girl scout. So if 2/5 of the students are boys, then (1 - 2/5) of the students are girls. That is, 3/5 of the students are girls. We already know that 2/3 of them are in the girl scout. So we can multiply 2/3 by 3/5 to get the percent of girls who are in the girl scout. 2 / 3 * 3 / 5 = 6 / 15 = 40%.
