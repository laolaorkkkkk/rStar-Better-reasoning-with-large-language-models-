She traveled six miles in two hours, so she traveled three miles per hour on average. However, her goal is to travel four miles per hour. To do this, she will need to go faster than she has been going. To find out how fast she would need to go, we need to divide the distance left to travel by the time remaining.

The answer is 1.", "value": 0.6}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, we can calculate how long it takes Marissa to walk the first 4 miles. It takes her an hour to walk 4 miles, so her walking rate is 1 mile per hour. This means it takes her 4 hours to walk the first 4 miles. Next, we can figure out how many miles Marissa has left to walk. Since there are 12 miles total, and she has already walked 4 miles, she has 8 miles left to go. To make sure her average speed is 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk those 8 miles in 2 hours, which would mean her walking rate is 4 miles per hour. The answer is: 4.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
