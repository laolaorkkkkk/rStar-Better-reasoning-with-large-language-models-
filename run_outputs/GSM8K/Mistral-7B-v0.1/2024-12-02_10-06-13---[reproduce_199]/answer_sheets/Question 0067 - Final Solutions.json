Then it says that there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so if we call the number of rubies r, the equation would be 175 - r = 35. Solving this equation, we find r = 140. Next we see that there were twice as many emeralds as the rubies, so if we call the number of emeralds e, the equation would be 2e = r. Substituting what we found for r, we get 2e = 140, which can be rearranged to e = 70.
