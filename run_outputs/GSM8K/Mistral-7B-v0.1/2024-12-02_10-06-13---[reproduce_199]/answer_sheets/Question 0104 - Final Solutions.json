So let's find out what the remainder was first. 1000 - 250 is 750. 3/10 of the remainder is 3/10 of 750. 3/10 is the same as 3 times 1/10. 3 times 1/10 is 30/100, which can be reduced to 3/10.

Originally, there were 1000 jigsaw pieces. One quarter were already placed. So we have to find out how many pieces remain. We can do this by finding out how many pieces were placed by mom. To get the right answer, we need to figure out how many pieces are remaining. We do this by figuring out how many pieces mom put down. We know that mom put down a third of all the pieces that were left. That means that we only need to consider the pieces that Poppy didn't place. So, we can take the original number of pieces (1000) and subtract the amount that Poppy placed (a quarter). This leaves us with the amount of pieces left: 1000 - 250 = 750. But wait, this isn't all! We still need to account for the amount of pieces that mom placed, which was also a third of what was remaining.

The answer is 500.\n\nHint 2: Let's try again. To find out how many jigsaw pieces remain unplaced, we can take the total number of jigsaw pieces and subtract all of the jigsaw pieces that have already been placed. Poppy placed one-quarter of the pieces on the board, so she placed 1/4 of 1000 pieces, or 250 pieces. Her mom placed a third of those, so she placed 1/3 of 750 pieces, or 250 pieces. Therefore, the total number of jigsaw pieces that remain unplaced is 1000 - (1/4 * 1000) - (1/3 * 750), which equals 500.
