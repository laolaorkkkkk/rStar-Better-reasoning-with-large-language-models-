When Raymond was born, it was 6 years before Samantha was born. That makes her 6 years younger than him. So, she was born 6 years after him. So she would be 31 - 6 = 25 years old. 25 - 6 = 19 years older than him. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, then we can subtract that number from 19 years to get the exact time frame. 19 - 23 is -4 years. But since we cannot go back in time, this value is invalid.
