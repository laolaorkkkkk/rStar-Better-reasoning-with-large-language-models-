Now the problem says that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So the number of birds must be 1/50 of the photographs that Brittany can hold. Since Brittany can hold 1/6 of what Jamal can hold, that means the number of birds is 1/50 of 1/6, or 1/300 of the total number of photographs. To get the exact number of photographs we need to multiply that fraction by the total amount of photographs, which is 1800. So 1800 / 300 = 6. The answer is: 6.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
