It was stated that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the instructions, we need to identify the initial and final numbers of jewels for each person. Based on the given information, let's assume that Aaron and Raymond have the same amount of jewels. So, we can write: Aaron has 2 more jewels than Siobhan. And Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, Aaron also has 5 more jewels than 20 (which is half of Raymond's jewels). Which makes it 25 jewels. Let's write this down as well. To summarize, we have: Siobhan has 2 less jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 2 more jewels than Siobhan. So, Aaron has 4 less jewels than Siobhan. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 20, so that means Aaron has 25 jewels. Now that we know the initial and final numbers of jewels for each person, we can calculate the answer. The question asks us to find out how many jewels Siobhan has, so we need to subtract the number of jewels Siobhan has from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many fewer jewels she has. Remember that we already found out the number of jewels Aaron has. So, the answer is the difference between those numbers: Siobhan has 2 less jewels than Aaron.

First we need to identify the intial numbers of jewels. It says \"Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.\" So let's call the number of jewels that Aaron has \"a\". That means Siobhan has \"a\" minus 2 jewels. Also it says \"Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.\" So let's call the number of jewels that Raymond has \"r\". That means Aaron has (r/2) plus 5 jewels. Since Aaron and Raymond both have the same amount of jewels, \"a\" = (r/2) plus 5. Since we know that \"a\" is also equal to the number of jewels that Siobhan has minus 2, we can write \"a\" as (r/2) plus 3. To solve for \"r\", we need to multiply both sides by 2. That gives us r = 2(a) - 10. The next step is to find out the final number of jewels for each person. It says \"Raymond has 40 jewels.\" So the final number of jewels that Raymond has is 40. To find out the final number of jewels that Siobhan has, we need to subtract the number of jewels that Siobhan has from the number of jewels that Aaron has. Using what we learned earlier, we can use the equation \"a\" = (r/2) plus 3. The number of jewels that Siobhan has is \"a\" minus 2. The number of jewels that Aaron has is (r/2) plus 3 plus 2. To find the final number of jewels that Siobhan has, we need to subtract the number of jewels that Siobhan has from the number of jewels that Aaron has.
