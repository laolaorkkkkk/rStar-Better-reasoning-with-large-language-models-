The total cost would be the sum of the costs of each type of pastry. First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen of them, which means 3 groups of 12 donuts. Since each group costs $68, multiply this by 3 to get the total cost of the donuts: $68 x 3 = $204. Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.

Each group costs $55, so multiply this by 6 to get the total cost of the mini cheesecakes: $55 x 6 = $330. To find the total cost, add up the individual costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $704.
