Firstly, we need to rewrite the question into a mathematical statement. We know that 2r equals b, which means that r is equal to half of b. We also know that a red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie, which means that if the price of a blue tie is x, the price of a red tie would be $\\frac{3x}{2}$. Now we can plug these values into our original equation. $200 = \\frac{2b}{1.5} * \\frac{3x}{2}$, where r is equal to half of b, and a red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.  We can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by 3/2 and then dividing both sides by 2. $200 * \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2b*3x}{2*1.5}$, which simplifies to $80 = bx$.\n\nTo find out how many ties John has, we can use the fact that 2r equals b. $80 = bx \\Rightarrow 80 = (2r)x$, which simplifies to $40 = rx$.  Now that we have a value for rx, we can substitute back into our earlier equation. $200 = \\frac{2b}{1.5} * \\frac{3x}{2}$, which becomes $200 = \\frac{2(2rx)}{1.5} * \\frac{3x}{2}$, which simplifies to $200 = 4x^2$, which further reduces to $x^2 = 50$.\n\nTo determine how many ties John has, we divide both sides by 50 to get $x = 2.236$.
