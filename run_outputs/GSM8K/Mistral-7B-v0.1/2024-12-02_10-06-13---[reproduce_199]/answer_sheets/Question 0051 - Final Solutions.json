Let's say at time T, Tom starts at point 1. He sails forward until 4 o'clock. At this point, he is at point 4. From 4 to 5, Tom is moving backwards at 6 mph. So at 5 he is back at 1 again. We can write an equation like so:\n6 mph * time from 4 to 5 = distance between 1 and 4.\nSo 6 * (5-4) = 1 - 4.\nSimplifying, we find that the time from 4 to 5 is equal to 1/6 hours.
