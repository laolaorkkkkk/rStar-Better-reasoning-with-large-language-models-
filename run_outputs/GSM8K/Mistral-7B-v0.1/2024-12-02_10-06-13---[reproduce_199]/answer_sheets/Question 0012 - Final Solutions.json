First, we calculate the total income per year. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons and sells them for $1.5 each, so the total income per year is 7 x $1.5 = $10.50. Next, we calculate the total expenses per year. The tree costs $90 to plant, and it needs $3 every year for watering and feeding, so the total expenses per year are $90 + $3 = $93. We subtract the total expenses from the total income per year, and get $10.50 - $93 = -$82.50. We need to keep subtracting until we get a positive value. So, we repeat this process until we get a positive value. We have to subtract -$82.50 from -$82.50, and we get -$165. Every time we subtract, the amount decreases by half, so the next one is -$82.50 - -$165 = -$82.50 + $82.50 = $0. After we reach $0, we know that the difference between the total income and total expenses is zero, so Carlos breaks even. To start earning money, he needs to make a profit, which means he needs to earn more than he spends. To do this, he needs to subtract more than $0. The next step is -$82.50 - $0 = -$82.50, which is less than zero. So, Carlos will need to wait -$82.50 years (-$82.50 / -$10.50) before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.

So, if you subtract the $3, Carlos ends up making only 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 dollars per year. If he wants to earn money, he has to make more than $3 per year.
