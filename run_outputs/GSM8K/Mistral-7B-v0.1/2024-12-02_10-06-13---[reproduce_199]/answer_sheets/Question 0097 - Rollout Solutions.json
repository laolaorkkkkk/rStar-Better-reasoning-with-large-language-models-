When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use? Step 1: Let's start with identifying the number of ounces of tomato sauce Freda made. The problem states that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce was 32 ounces. Step 2: Next, let's identify the volume that one can of tomatoes loses when cooked into sauce. The problem states that canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce. Step 3: Calculate the volume loss per tomato. To do this, we multiply the volume lost by the number of tomatoes in a can of tomatoes. So, the volume loss per tomato would be half of 16 ounces, or 8 ounces. Step 4: Since each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, we need to divide the volume loss by three. So, the volume lost per can of tomatoes is 8 ounces divided by 3, which equals 2.67 ounces. Step 5: Use the calculation in step 3 to determine how many cans of tomatoes Freda used in total. We know the volume loss for each can of tomatoes, and we also know the amount of sauce that was made. So, we can calculate the total number of cans used by dividing the volume loss by the volume loss per can of tomatoes. The answer is (total volume of sauce / volume lost per can of tomatoes) * 3.
