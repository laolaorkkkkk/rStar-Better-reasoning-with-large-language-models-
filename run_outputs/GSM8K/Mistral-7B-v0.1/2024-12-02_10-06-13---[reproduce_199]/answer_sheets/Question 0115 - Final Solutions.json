Ten times 10 is 100. So 100. Then she has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. Five times 16 is 80. So 100 plus 80 is 180. That is the total cost for all of the wood. Now let's figure out the total revenue. That is what Sasha got when she sold everything. Each 2 x 4 x 10 board was worth 15 dollars. Ten times fifteen is 150. And each 4 x 4 x 10 was worth twenty dollars. Five times twenty is 100. So the total revenue is 150 plus 100, which is 250.

The profit is the amount earned minus the amount spent. That means we first need to calculate how much it costs to buy the wood and then calculate how much it earns us by selling it. To calculate how much it costs to buy the wood, we need to add up the price per board times the quantity of the board. So first we need to count the price per board times the number of boards of a type. For example, 10 x 10 is 100, which means that 10 * 10 = 100. We need to do this for all types of boards. Let's start with the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 x 10 = 100. Next, we need to multiply the price per board times the quantity of that type of board again for the other type of board, which is 4 x 4 x 10 boards. This would be: 5 x 16 = 80. Now we can add those together to get the total cost of buying the wood. It is 100 + 80 = 180. So the total cost was 180. Next we need to calculate how much the wood can earn us by selling all of it. This means we need to know the price of a board. The price of a board is 15 dollars per 2 x 4 x 10 board and 20 dollars per 4 x 4 x 10 board. So we need to find out the total number of boards sold and multiply that times the price of a board. The number of 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10. The number of 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5. So if we multiply these numbers together and then multiply the result by the price of a board, we will have the total value of all the boards. It would be: 10 * 15 + 5 * 20 = 150 + 100 = 250. So the total value is 250 dollars. Finally, we need to subtract the total cost from the total value to get the profit. The profit is 250 - 180 = 70.
