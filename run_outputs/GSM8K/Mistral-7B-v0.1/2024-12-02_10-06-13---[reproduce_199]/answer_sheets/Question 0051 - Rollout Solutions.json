It also goes 6 mph coming back. Let's say the trip takes 2 hours, which is not correct because the ship moves faster in one direction than another. The only way this could work out is if the ship travels 20 miles in 1 hour. But 20 / 10 = 2 which is too little distance traveled in too much time. This means our trip needs to take less than 2 hours to go both ways. Because the ship travels 6 miles in one hour. So 6 + 6 = 12 miles in two hours. That's too few miles in too much time. So our time is between these two times (1 and 2). It must be closer to 1 hour since our ship is traveling faster during its forward journey.\n\nSo we know our ship can travel 60 miles in 6 hours. That is 10 mph. So in 1 hour our ship will travel 10 miles. Our forward time is between 1 and 2 hours. So let's pick 1.5 as our midpoint between these two values. This is when we find that our ship travels 15 miles in 1.5 hours. This means our ship travels 15 miles per hour.\n\nBut we want to travel 4 miles, so we divide 4 by 15. And we get .266666666666666666667. Which rounds up to .266666666666666666667. This value is called our velocity ratio. We use it to determine how long it will take us to complete our journey. We simply multiply our journey length by our velocity ratio. So 4 * .266666666666666666667 = 1.06666666666666666667. That's 1 hour and .066666666666666666667 minutes.
