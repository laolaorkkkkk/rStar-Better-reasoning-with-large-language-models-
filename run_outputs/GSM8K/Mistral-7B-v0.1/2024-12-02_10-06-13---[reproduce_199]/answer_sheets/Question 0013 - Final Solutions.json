First, we know that Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners left. To figure out how many she started with, we can use the equation: (5 / 3) + 2 + (5 / 2). This tells us that Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners than she started with. Next, we can determine how many vacuum cleaners she started with by solving for the unknown. We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she started with 5. Solving for this, we get (5 / 3) = 2. Therefore, Melanie started with 2 vacuum cleaners. Next, we can solve for the number of vacuum cleaners she sold to the red house by subtracting 2 from 5. This gives us 3. Finally, we can solve for the number of vacuum cleaners she sold to the orange house by dividing 5 by 2. This gives us 2.5, so she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the orange house.
