Marcell's fruit roll-up has 3 x 14 = 42 square units of area. The average area is (48 + 42) / 2 = 45 square units. This means that one average fruit roll-up has 45 square units of area. Since each roll-up is 1 inch tall, this means it has 45 inches of length. One inch of a fruit roll-up has 1/45th of its area, or 1/45th of 45 square inches. That is 1 square inch. We can say that the area of one piece of fruit roll-up is 1 square inch. If Beatrice and Marcell ate 48 pieces, then Beatrice ate 48 * 1 = 48 pieces. If Marcell ate 42 pieces, then Marcell ate 42 * 1 = 42 pieces. This means that on average, they ate (48 + 42) / 2 = 45 pieces of fruit roll-up.
