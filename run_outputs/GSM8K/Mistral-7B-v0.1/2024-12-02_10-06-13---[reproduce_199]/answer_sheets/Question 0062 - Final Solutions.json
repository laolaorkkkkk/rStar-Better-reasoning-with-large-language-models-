If Marcy works for 40 years, she receives a 50k annual pension. If she works for 30 years and then leaves, she still gets her 50k annual pension but it increases by 5% per year until she reaches 40 years. So if she starts at 40 years, we can get our first number. We know she is going to get 50k annually. That is the base. Let's say that number is 1. Next, 1 plus 5% of that number gives us 105% of that number. This means that every year, she gets an increase of 5%. So let's take the 105% and divide it by 100 (since percentages are just numbers divided by 100). That gives us 1.05. Multiplying this number by itself gives us 1.05 squared. When we multiply 1.05 squared by 1.05, we get 1.1025. And when we multiply 1.1025 by 1.05, we get 1.157625. This gives us the amount of time before Marcy works for 40 years.\n\nNext, we multiply that number by the number of years she worked (30) to get the amount of time it took for her to work for 40 years.\n\nWe multiply 1.157625 by 30.

So, Marcy worked for 4 years before retiring.\n\nWith this information, we can calculate her annual pension.
