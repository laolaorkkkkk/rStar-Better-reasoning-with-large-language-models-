Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. So let's call the original number of vacuum cleaners X. Since she sold a third of them at the green house, it means 1/3 of X, or X / 3. To sell 2 more to the red house, it means X / 3 + 2. Finally, since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, it means (X / 2). These three sum up to 5. We can rewrite the equation as X / 3 + X / 2 + 2 = 5. We can simplify by adding terms with the same denominator. (X / 3) + (X / 2) = 3. We can then solve for X by multiplying both sides by 6. X = 6. The answer is: 6.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
