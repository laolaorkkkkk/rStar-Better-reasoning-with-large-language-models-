We know Bailey received a total of 100 dollars at the end of 8 weeks. Of this, 35 dollars was during the first 7 weeks. Since Bailey received 5 dollars each week, we can divide 100 / 5 which equals 20. So Bailey received 20 dollars during the last week. Bailey's original amount plus 5 dollars per week equals 20 dollars per week times 8 weeks. So the original amount plus 5 times 8 is 100. The original amount is 100 - (5 * 8) which is 100 - 40 which is 60.
