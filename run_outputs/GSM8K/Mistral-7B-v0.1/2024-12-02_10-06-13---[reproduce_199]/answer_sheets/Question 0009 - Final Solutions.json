Let's look at what we know and what we need to find out. We need to calculate the amount of money earned for the week. We know that the hourly rate per hour for the first 40 hours was 10$. We also know that the hourly rate for overtime pay is 1.2 times the regular hourly rate. Eliza worked for 45 hours this week. We can break down the calculation into steps. First, we calculate the amount of money earned for the first 40 hours by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked. Second, we calculate the amount of money earned for overtime pay by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours worked for overtime. Finally, we add together the amounts calculated for the first 40 hours and for overtime pay to get the total amount of money earned for the week. To summarize, we can solve this problem using the following equation: Amount of money earned for the week = [(Hourly rate for first 40 hours) x (Number of hours worked for first 40 hours)] + [(Hourly rate for overtime pay) x (Number of hours worked for overtime pay)] In our case, the hourly rate for the first 40 hours is 10$, the hourly rate for overtime pay is 12$ since it is 1.2 times the regular rate, the number of hours worked for the first 40 hours is 40, and the number of hours worked for overtime pay is 5. Therefore, the equation becomes: Amount of money earned for the week = (10$ x 40) + (12$ x 5) = 400$ + 60$ = 460$.
