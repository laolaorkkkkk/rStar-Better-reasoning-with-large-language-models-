This means Ben's iPhone is 1/4th as old as Brandon's iPhone. Since Brandon's iPhone is 4 times older than Ben's iPhone, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1/4th as old as Brandon's iPhone. We also know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, so it's 4 times younger than Brandon's iPhone. Therefore, if Brandon's iPhone is $X$ years old, then Ben's iPhone is $X / 4$, and Suzy's iPhone is $X / (4 * 2)$, or $X / 8$.\n\nSo, let's try to figure out what $X$ is:\n\nWe know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. So $X / 8$ = 1. $X$ = 8. We now know how old Brandon's iPhone is! The answer is: 8.\n\nHint 2: It can be helpful to write down an algebraic equation based on the information given. In this case, we could use the equations:\n\n$B = 2 * S$\n\n$S = B / 4$\n\nwhere $B$ is Ben's iPhone, $S$ is Suzy's iPhone, and $T$ is Brandon's iPhone. Using these equations, we can solve for $B$:\n\n$S = B / 4$\n\n$2 * S = B$\n\n$(B / 4) * 2 = B$\n\n$B = 2 * (B / 4)$\n\n$B = B / 2$\n\n$B = 2$\n\nThis tells us that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, then Brandon's iPhone must be 2 * 2 = 4 years old.
