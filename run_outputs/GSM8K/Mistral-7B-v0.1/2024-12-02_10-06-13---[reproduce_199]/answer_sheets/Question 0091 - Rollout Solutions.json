Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. That means that Marcia has one third of the pets Jan has. If Marcia has one third and Cindy has one fewer, then Marcia and Cindy together have only 2/3. One third of Jan's pets, plus 2/3 of all the pets would be Jan's entire amount of pets. So multiplying the total number of pets by 2/3 is the same thing as adding 1/3. And if there are twice as many pets as Jan has, then Jan's amount would be half. So let's say Jan has 10. Multiply by 2/3 and we get 6. Add 1/3 to get 6 + 1/3 = 7. That is the total number of pets. Then divide by 2 to get Jan's amount of pets. 7 divided by 2 equals 3.5.
