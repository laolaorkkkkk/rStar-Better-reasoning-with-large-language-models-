The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. Since she took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, she could row 20 * 16 / 64 = 4 feet in 1 second. Given that the boat was taking on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can calculate the rate at which the boat was taking on water as follows: 2 liters/10 * 4 ft/sec = 0.8 liter/sec. Now that we know the rate at which the boat was taking on water and the distance she had rowed, we can use the following formula to calculate the amount of water taken on: Distance * Rate = Time * Amount.

We can calculate the amount of water taken on by the boat by multiplying the amount of water taken on per foot times the number of feet traveled.
