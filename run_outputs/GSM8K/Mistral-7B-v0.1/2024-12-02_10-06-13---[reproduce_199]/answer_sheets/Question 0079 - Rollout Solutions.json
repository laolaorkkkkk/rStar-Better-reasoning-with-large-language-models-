Since it says John took the dog to the groomer, that means he paid for the service. If you take something to be serviced, it implies you paid someone to do it, so the cost is positive. The only other information we know is that there was a 30% discount. Let's call the amount before the discount x. That means the amount after the discount would be x - 0.3x = 0.7x. What we want to know is what x equals, since that tells us the full cost (including the discount). We can solve this by multiplying both sides by 10/7 and dividing both sides by 1. We get x = 100. So the cost without any discount is 100, but with a 30% discount, that turns into 100 * 0.7 = 70.
