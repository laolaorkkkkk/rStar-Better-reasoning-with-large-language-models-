There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. There are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher. Let's find the number of boys first. We can convert the statement about boys to an equation. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we get 2x = b, where x represents the number of girls, and b represents the number of boys. Solving this equation gives us b = 2x. Next, let's find the total number of students. We know there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, so the total number of students is s = 60g + 5t, where g represents the number of girls, and t represents the number of teachers. Substituting the number of boys for x gives us s = 60g + 5b/2, since b = 2x. Finally, we simplify and solve the equation. s = 60g + 5b/2 = 60g + 5(2x)/2 = 60g + 5*2x = 60g + 10x = 10x + 60g. Factoring out 10x from both sides, we get 10x + 60g = (10x + 60g) and (10x + 60g). Dividing both sides by 10x + 60g gives us t = 1. So there are 1 teacher.

Boys are twice as many as girls. That means if there are n boys, there would be n/2 girls. We want to know the number of teachers. There are 60 girls, and there are 5 students per teacher. That makes 60 / 5 = 12 teachers. The number of boys is n. n / 2 is the number of girls. So we have a ratio of boys to girls as 2n : n/2. We convert this to an equation by saying that 2n is equal to n/2. Dividing both sides by n / 2 gives us 2n / (n / 2) = n/2 / (n / 2). That cancels the n / 2 from both sides, so we are left with 2 = 1. This isn't right. Something went wrong. Let's go back to the original equation and multiply it by n/2 to get 2n = n. That means n = n. n is equal to itself, which is always true. So we need to find out what we did wrong. It is most likely that we didn't cancel correctly or we made a mistake with our arithmetic. Let's try again. The correct ratio of boys to girls is 2n : n/2. We convert this to an equation by saying that 2n is equal to n/2. Solving for n gives us n = 2n/2 = n.
