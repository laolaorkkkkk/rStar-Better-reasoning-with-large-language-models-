The boots cost the same amount as all three shoes combined. Each pair of high heels costs a different amount, with the first pair costing $33 and the second pair costing twice that, or $66. Now let's use this information to find the total price of all three shoes. This will be the price of the boots plus the total price of both pairs of high heels. We can find the total price of the high heels by adding up the prices of each pair. So the total price of all three shoes is the price of the boots plus $33 + $66, which equals $33 + $66 + price of the boots. Let's make a table of the information we've written down. We'll call the price of the boots T.\n\n| Price | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Boots | T |\n| First pair of heels | $33 |\n| Second pair of heels | $66 |\n| Total price of three shoes | $33 + $66 + T |\n\nNow let's rewrite our equation using the values we've identified in our table. The total price of all three shoes equals the price of the boots plus the total price of both pairs of high heels. So $33 + $66 + T = price of the boots + $33 + $66. Let's simplify this equation by subtracting $33 + $66 from both sides. We get $33 + $66 + T - $33 - $66 = price of the boots + $33 + $66 - $33 - $66. Now let's combine like terms. We get T - $99 = price of the boots. Finally, let's isolate the price of the boots by subtracting T from both sides. We get price of the boots - T = -$99.
