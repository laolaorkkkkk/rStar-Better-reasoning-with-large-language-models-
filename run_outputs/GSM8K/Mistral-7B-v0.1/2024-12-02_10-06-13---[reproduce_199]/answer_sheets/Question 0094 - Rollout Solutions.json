The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Let's call that combined number X. That means we can write down (X - 12) as the number of rabbits, and X as the combined number of dog and cat pets. We want to find X. X has to equal the number of cat pets plus the number of dog pets. This is because the number of dog pets equals X - the number of cat pets. Therefore, X has to be the sum of the number of cat pets and the number of dog pets. X has to equal (number of cat pets) + (number of dog pets). In words, this is \"the combined number of pets\", which is what X represents. The number of rabbits, X - 12, must also equal the number of dog pets. That's because if you take the number of rabbit pets away from the number of combined pets, you get the number of dog pets. Therefore, X - 12 must equal (number of dog pets). From this information, we know that X has to equal (number of cat pets) + (number of dog pets), or in other words, the sum of the number of cat pets and the number of dog pets. Also, we know that X - 12 must equal the number of dog pets. To solve this equation, we add X - 12 to both sides of the equation. We know that X - 12 = (number of dog pets). Now we have X - 12 + X - 12 = (number of dog pets) + (number of dog pets). We can simplify this to 2X - 24 = (number of dog pets) + (number of dog pets). We can combine the two (number of dog pets) terms into one term. So we get 2X - 24 = 2(number of dog pets). We can divide both sides by 2 to get X - 12 = (number of dog pets).
