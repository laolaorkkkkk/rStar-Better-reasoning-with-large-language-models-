Let's start by calculating the number of hours Meredith spent writing articles on Monday. According to the problem, Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, so she spent 5 * 4 hours writing articles on that day.\nNext, let's calculate the number of hours Meredith spent writing articles on Tuesday. The problem states that she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Let's say that she wrote x articles on Tuesday. This means that she spent x * 4 hours writing articles on that day.\nFinally, let's calculate the number of hours Meredith spent writing articles on Wednesday. The problem states that she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. If we let y represent the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday, then we can use the formula y = 2x to calculate the number of articles she wrote. This means that she spent y * 4 hours writing articles on Wednesday.\nNow that we have calculated the number of hours Meredith spent writing articles on each day, we can add them together to find the total number of hours she spent writing articles. Adding the hours spent on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we get 20 + 4x + y * 4 hours. Since y = 2x, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 20 + 4x + (2x) * 4 hours. Simplifying this expression, we get 20 + 8x + 4x = 24 + 12x hours. The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is therefore 24 + 12x hours.\nIt's worth noting that the problem uses the variable x to represent the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday and the variable y to represent the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. However, these variables could be replaced with any other letters or symbols as long as their values remain consistent with the equations used in the solution.\nIn conclusion, by performing some basic calculations and using the given information, we were able to determine that Meredith spent a total of 24 + 12x hours writing articles in the three days.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job.
