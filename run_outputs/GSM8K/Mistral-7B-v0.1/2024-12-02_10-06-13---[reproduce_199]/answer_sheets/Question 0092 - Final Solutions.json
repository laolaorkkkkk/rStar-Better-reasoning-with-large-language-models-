We know Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy. So if we can find out Jackson's age, we could figure out Amy's age. Amy is also 2 years older than Corey. We also know that Corey is 2 years younger than James. So if we can determine Corey's age, we could find out everyone's ages. Corey is also 5 years older than Jackson. We can use this information to help us find Corey's age. Let's start with Corey's age. If Corey is 2 years younger than James, James is 2 years older than Corey. We also know that Corey is 5 years older than Jackson. That means that Jackson is 5 years younger than Corey. And finally, we know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Now we can add all those ages together and see what we get. We get James's age + Corey's age + Jackson's age + Amy's age. Since Corey is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is 5 years younger than Corey, and since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy's age is 2 years younger than Corey's age. We also know that Corey is 2 years younger than James, so James's age is 2 years older than Corey's age. Adding them all up, we get James's age + 2 (Corey's age) + 5 (Jackson's age) + 2 (Amy's age).

There are four kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. We know Jackson is 5 years older than Amy. We also know Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey. And we know Corey is one year older than James. To find out Jackson's age, we need to add Amy's age and Jackson's age together. Let's say Jackson's age is J and Amy's age is A. That means: 11 = J + A. And now we can solve for J. We can subtract A from both sides to get rid of A and isolate J. 11 - A = J. We can divide both sides by 1 to get rid of the fraction. 11/1 = J/1, which is the same as J = 11/1.
