(x is 12 and y is 40%, since we only repaired car tires). So we get 12*40%/100 = 4.8. Since it can't be 0.8 truck tires, we can say 5 truck tires were repaired. That means 4 car tires were also repaired. Now let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two days. On thursday, 6 truck tires were repaired at $60 each, and 4 car tires were repaired at $40 each. This comes to 6*60 + 4*40 = 480 dollars. On friday, 12 car tires were repaired at $40 each, and 5 truck tires were repaired at $60 each. This comes to 12*40 + 5*60 = 360 dollars. So the difference in revenue is 480 - 360 = 120 dollars.
