The answer is 13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza).", "value": 0.4}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, what is the total price of all of Marie's items? 1 chicken meal costs 12 dollars. Marie also bought 5 packs of milk which costs 5 * 3 = 15 dollars, 4 apples which costs 4 * 1.50 = 6 dollars, and some boxes of pizza which costs 8.50 per box. The total price is 12 + 15 + 6 + (boxes of pizza) * 8.50 = 37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza). That means that the total price is 37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza) dollars. Next, how much money does she have left after paying for all of these items? She has 50 dollars. When she pays 37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza), she only has 50 - (37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza)). In other words, 50 - 37 - 8.50(boxes of pizza) = 13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza). The answer is 13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza). This tells us that we need to solve for the unknown amount of boxes of pizza that she ordered in order to find out how much money she has left.\nTo find out the total price of all of the items that she purchased, we take into account everything that she ordered and multiply it by its corresponding cost. For example, if we know that she ordered 5 boxes of pizza and each box of pizza costs 8.50 dollars, we would multiply 8.50 * 5 = 42.50 dollars for the total cost of the 5 boxes of pizza. We can then add this cost to the total cost of the other items that she purchased to get a final total price for all of the items that she purchased. In this case, the total price of all of the items that she purchased is equal to 37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza).\nNext, let us consider how much money she has left after paying for all of the items that she purchased. We know that she has 50 dollars. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total price of all of the items that she purchased from the initial 50 dollars that she has. In this case, we are subtracting 37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza) from 50 dollars to find out how much money she has left. We can write this as follows:\n50 - (37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza)) = 50 - 37 - 8.50(boxes of pizza) = 13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza).\nFinally, to find out the total cost of the 5 boxes of pizza that she ordered, we can rearrange the equation above to isolate the unknown variable, which is the number of boxes of pizza. We start by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:\n13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza) = 50 - (37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza))\n13 - 8.50(boxes of pizza) - 13 = 50 - (37 + 8.50(boxes of pizza)) - 13\n-8.50(boxes of pizza) = 50 - 37 - 13\n-8.50(boxes of pizza) = 50 - 50\n-8.50(boxes of pizza) = 0\nDividing both sides of the equation by -8.50, we obtain:\nboxes of pizza = -0 / -8.50\nboxes of pizza = 0\nThis means that the number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered was 0.\nIn conclusion, the total cost of all of the items that Marie ordered is 37 + 8.50(0) = 37 dollars.
