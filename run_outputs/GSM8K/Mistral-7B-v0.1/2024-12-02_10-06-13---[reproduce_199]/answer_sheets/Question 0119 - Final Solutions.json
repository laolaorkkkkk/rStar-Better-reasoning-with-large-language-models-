Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. This means Lylah's salary is 30 percent less than Adrien's salary. Adrien was initially earning $40000. We know the initial salary of both people. Let's call the amount Adrien gets 4 years later X. After 4 years, the increase is 40%. This means the amount 4 years ago is X/1.4. So we need to solve for X when X / 1.4 = 40000 + 0.4X. X = 28000. Then Lylah would get 40000 - 28000 = 12000 less than Adrien.
