Since he had 110 cookies, he made 110 - 5 = 105 cookies. Since he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year, he would want to multiply the 105 by 2. This would result in 210 cookies being made. But, because he only made 105, he made half of what he intended to. This means that he made 105 / 2 = 52.5 cookies.

Therefore, last year Henry made 67.5 cookies.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to think about how many cookies Henry wanted to make this year compared to last year. This year he wanted to make double the amount he made last year. Last year he made 105 cookies, so this year he wanted to make 105 x 2 = 210 cookies.
