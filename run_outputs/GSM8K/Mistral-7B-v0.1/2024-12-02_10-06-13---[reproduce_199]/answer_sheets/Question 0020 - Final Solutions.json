To do this, we can multiply the amounts of each drink by their corresponding fractions. For the orange drink, we get 10*2/3 which is 6.667 liters. For the pineapple drink, we get 15*3/5 which is 9 liters. Add these together to get 15.667 liters. That means that when we combine them, we'll have 24 liters of drink, which is 15.667+15 = 24. Now, let's subtract out the lost liter of orange drink from our total amount of drink. This leaves us with 29 liters. We need to calculate what fraction of that is water. To do this, we divide the amount of water by the total amount of drink. Our calculation comes out to (29*9/20) which gives us 13.5 liters.

First we need to find out how much orange drink is in the total 24 liters. We know the ratio of orange drink and water is 2:3.

Secondly, if I have 15 liters of pineapple drink, then I can divide that by its ratio of 3:5 which is 3/5. I am able to calculate that because I know 3:5 is the ratio of pineapple drink and water. Therefore, 15 / (3/5) = 15 x 5 / 3 = 25. This means that 15 liters of pineapple drink has 5 parts water. Therefore, after I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I have 24 liters.

That means 15-10=5 liters of orange drink is left. The pineapple drink is 3/5 water. Let us find out how many liters of it is water. 3/5 * pineapple drink = water.
