First we determine how much Uriah's bag initially weighed. Since we know he removed 15 pounds, we can find out that 15 was the total weight of the things he took off. If the initial weight of his book bag was B, then we would know that B - 15 = 0. We solve this equation to find that B = 15. Now we know that the total weight of the comic books and toys in his bookbag before he took anything out was 15 pounds. Next we determine the weight of 1 comic book. This is easy because it says each one weighs 1/4 pound. So we know that if you had 10 comic books, then their combined weight would be 10 * (1/4) pounds = 2.5 pounds. We also determine the weight of 1 toy. Each toy weights 1/2 pound. So if we had 10 toys, then their combined weight would be 10 * (1/2) pounds = 5 pounds. Next we want to figure out how much the comic books weighed in total. We know that Uriah needed to take off 15 pounds from his book bag, so we know that the 30 comic books he took out weighed 15 pounds. So 30 * (1/4) = 7.5. Last, we want to figure out how many toys Uriah needs to take off. Since we know that the combined weight of the comic books he took off was 7.5 pounds, we can subtract that from the original weight of his book bag, which we calculated to be 15 pounds.
