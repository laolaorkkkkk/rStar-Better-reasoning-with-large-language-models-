Let the original number of ducks be D, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold be B, and the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold be J. We know that: J = 6B, D/50 = B, and J/6 = D. Substituting these values into the expression for D yields: D = (D/50) * 6 = 6D/50. Multiplying both sides by 50 yields: 50D = 6D. Solving for D yields: 50D = 6D or D = 6D/50. Substituting this value for D into the expression for B yields: B = D/50 = 6D/(50*50) = 6D/2500. Substituting this value for B into the expression for J yields: J = 6B = 6(6D/2500) = 6^2D/2500 = 36D/2500. Substituting this value for J into the expression for D yields: D = J/6 = 36D/2500/6 = 36D/15000 = 6D/2500. Solving for D yields: 6D/2500 = 36D/15000 or D = 36D/15000*2500 = 36D/15000*2500*2500/2500 = 36D/15000*1500 = 6D/2500. Substituting this value for D into the expression for B yields: B = D/50 = 6D/2500/50 = 6D/2500*2500/2500 = 6D/2500*1 = 6D/2500. Substituting this value for B into the expression for J yields: J = 6B = 6(6D/2500) = 36D/2500.

We know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means we want to find the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, which we will call X. We also know that the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold is 6 times more than Brittany's phone, so 6X. And finally, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. We can write this as:\n```\nX is the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.\n```\n```\nBrittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.\n```\n```\n6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone is Jamal's phone.\n```\n```\nJamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.\n```\nWe can solve this using a mathematical formula. First, let's find X, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. We can write this as follows:\n```\nX = 50 x bird number in Jamal's photo\n```\nNext, we can write an equation for the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, which we just calculated above. Let's call it Y. We can write this as follows:\n```\nY = 6X\n```\nNow, we need to find X. We can do this by substituting the value of X into the equation we wrote for the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. We can write this as follows:\n```\nY = 6 x 50 x bird number in Jamal's photo\n```\nSince we know that the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold is 1800, we can substitute this into our equation. This gives us:\n```\n1800 = 6 x 50 x bird number in Jamal's photo\n```\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 and 50 to get the bird number in Jamal's photo. This gives us:\n```\n1800/6/50 = bird number in Jamal's photo\n```\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n```\n1800/6/50 = 1800/300\n```\nThen, simplifying, we get:\n```\n1800/6/50 = 6\n```\nSo the answer is 6.

The problem also says that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

Let's set up a ratio for this: 1 photograph / 50 birds. Now we compare these two ratios: the number of photographs held by Jamal's phone is 6 times more than the number of photographs held by Brittany's phone; 6/1 (photographs) : 1/50 (birds).
