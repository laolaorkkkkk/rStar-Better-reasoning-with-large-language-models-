The number of pots of flowers he sells is 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias. He wants to know how much he will make. Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify the price of each type of flower. Marigolds cost $2.74 per pot. Petunias cost $1.87 per pot. And begonias cost $2.12 per pot. Because Artie doesn't have any change today, he rounds all the prices to the nearest dollar. This means that Marigolds become $3 per pot, Petunias become $2 per pot and Begonias become $2 per pot too.
