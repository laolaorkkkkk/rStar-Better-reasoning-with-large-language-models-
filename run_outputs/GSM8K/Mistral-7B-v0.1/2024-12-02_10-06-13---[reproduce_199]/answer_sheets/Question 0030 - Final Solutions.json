This means that Darrell's age in 10 years is y+10."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's first find Darrell's age. His age is 7/11 of Allen's age, which is called x here. Darrell's age is therefore 7/11 of x. We will call it y. We also know that Darrell's age is y. We need to find Darrell's age 10 years from now. That is to say, we need to add 10 years to y. That makes Darrell's age 10 years from now y + 10. Now let's find Allen's age. It is 11/7 times Darrell's age. Which is also the same as saying 11/7 times y. Or y*11/7. But, we don't want the age right now. We want the age 10 years later. So we add 10 to Allen's age now. That becomes y*11/7 + 10. Now let's get back to the question. We are told that the sum of their ages is 162. Darrell's age is y and Allen's age is y*11/7 + 10. So we can write 162 = y + y*11/7 + 10. Let's multiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the fraction. 7*162 = 7*y + 7*(y*11/7) + 7*10. Doing this gives us 1134 = 7y + y*11 + 70. Adding -y*11 on both sides gives 1134 - y*11 = 7y + 70. Factorizing 1134 - 70 on the left hand side, we get 11*110 - 7*10 = 7y. Dividing by 7 on both sides gives us 11*15 - 10 = y. Let's call this y2. Therefore, Darrell's age is y2 and Allen's age is y2*11/7 + 10. In 10 years, Darrell's age would be y2 + 10. And Allen's age would be y2*11/7 + 10 + 10. Let's calculate these two and compare them. y2 + 10 is 11*15 + 10 = 11*16. y2*11/7 + 10 + 10 is 11*15*11/7 + 10 + 10 = 11*15*11/7 + 20. The sum of these two is 11*16 + 11*15*11/7 + 20. The question wants the difference of these two numbers, which is the same as subtracting 11*16 from it. Therefore, we just need to subtract 11*16 from 11*16 + 11*15*11/7 + 20. That gives us 11*15*11/7 + 11*16 - 11*16. Factoring out 11*16 on the left hand side, we get 11*15*11/7 - 11*16. Divide both sides by 11. We get 15*11/7 - 16 = 0. This gives us 15*11/7 = 16. Multiplying both sides by 7 gives us 15*11 = 112. Solving this, we get 11*15 = 112/11 = 10. Therefore Allen's age is 10.

Then, we know that 10 years later than Allen's current age is equal to 10 years later than Allen's current age. By definition, the equation would be: y = 10 years later than Allen's current age. So we can replace 10 years later than Allen's current age with 11/7 * x + 10 years. So the equation would become y = 11/7 * x + 10 years.
