She used some material to make it. Then she hired someone to help her make the brooch. Finally, she wanted to make sure that the brooch was well protected so she got insurance. Let's call the first part of the question Materials. Let's call the second part of the question Construction. And finally, let's call the third part of the question Insurance. Okay, now let's go through the steps to figure out the answer. First, we need to add up all the different parts. We know that Janet paid $500 for Materials. That means $500 goes into the Materials category. Next, let's look at Construction. Janet paid $800 for Construction. So, add $800 to the Construction category. Next, let's look at Insurance. To calculate this, you need to first find the sum of the costs of Materials and Construction. You can use the following formula: (Materials + Construction) * 0.10. When you put in the numbers from before, you get (500 + 800) * 0.10, which simplifies to (1300) * 0.10, or just 130 * 0.10. Finally, when you add this number (130) to Construction, you get 800 + 130 = 930. Since we already know that the Materials category has $500, we just need to add these two numbers together to get the final answer: 500 + 930 = 1430.
