The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit? To find out how many boxes we can put in the truck, let's first figure out how much each individual box weighs and how much the driver and the truck without any boxes weigh together. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so putting one box in the truck would make it weigh 15 pounds more. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. That means when there are no boxes in the truck, the driver and the truck together weigh 3755 pounds. Now let's think about what happens if we put a bunch of boxes in the truck. First, we need to find out how many boxes we can fit into the truck. Because the truck can only hold up to 5000 pounds, we can divide the difference between the weight of the truck with no boxes and 5000 by 15, which is the weight of each box. So we can put 42 boxes into the truck. That means the driver and the truck together will weigh 3755 pounds plus 42 times 15 pounds, or 42 times 15 equals 630 pounds. Since the truck with all the boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds, adding the 3755 pounds of the driver and the empty truck to the 630 pounds of all the boxes would still be under the 5000 pound weight limit.
