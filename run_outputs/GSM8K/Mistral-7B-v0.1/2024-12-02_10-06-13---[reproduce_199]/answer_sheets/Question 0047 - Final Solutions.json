Firstly, we need to rewrite the question into a mathematical statement. We know that 2r equals b, which means that r is equal to half of b.

Now we can plug these values into our original equation. $200 = \\frac{2b}{1.5} * \\frac{3x}{2}$, where r is equal to half of b, and a red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.  We can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by 3/2 and then dividing both sides by 2. $200 * \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2b*3x}{2*1.5}$, which simplifies to $80 = bx$.\n\nTo find out how many ties John has, we can use the fact that 2r equals b. $80 = bx \\Rightarrow 80 = (2r)x$, which simplifies to $40 = rx$.

First let's focus on John's spending on blue ties. Blue ties cost 40 each. He spent 200 dollars on them. So John bought 200/40 = 5. He bought 5 blue ties. Next let's see what happened with the red ties. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, he bought 5 x 2 = 10 red ties. And he paid 60 dollars for each of those red ties. That makes 10 x 60 = 600 dollars. So 600 is the sum of the price of all the ties.

And if one blue tie costs 1 dollar, then the price of the red tie is 1.5 times higher. That makes the price of the red tie 1.5.\n\nAlso we know that John bought 5 blue ties, because each of them costs 40 dollars, so 40*5 = 200 dollars.\n\nNow let's figure out how many red ties John bought. We know that the price of the red tie is 1.5 times as high as the price of the blue tie, and since we already knew that one blue tie costs 1 dollar, then the price of the red tie is 1.5 times higher.

This is equal to 3. This means that John purchased 3 red ties.\n\nSince John purchased 3 red ties, the price of the red ties was 3*1.5 = 4.5.
