First we'll calculate how much potato salad each dinosaur will eat. An adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad. One child eats half as much as one adult, so one child eats 5 pounds of potato salad. Since there are 20 adults, 20 adults will eat 10*20=200 pounds of potato salad. And since there are 5 children, 5 children will eat 5*5=25 pounds of potato salad. So altogether the dinosaurs will eat 200+25=225 pounds of potato salad. Ted needs to get enough potato salad to make sure the picnic dinosaurs don't go hungry. So he needs at least 225 pounds of potato salad.
