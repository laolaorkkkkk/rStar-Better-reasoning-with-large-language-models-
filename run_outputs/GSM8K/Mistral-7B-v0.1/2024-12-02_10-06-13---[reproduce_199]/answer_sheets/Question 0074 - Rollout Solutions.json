Marigolds are $2.74 per pot, so 12 marigold pots cost $2.74 * 12 = $32.88. Petunias are sold for $1.87 each, so 9 petunias cost $1.87 * 9 = $16.83. Begonias are sold for $2.12 per pot, so 17 begonias cost $2.12 * 17 = $36.04. 32.88 + 16.83 + 36.04 is $85.75. The answer is: $85.75.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
