It also says there are 5 servings. So, we multiply these two numbers to get total calories in the bag (250 * 5 = 1250). We know the bag is 300g. So divide this value by the total calories we just calculated (1250 / 300), which is 4.16. This means there are 4.16 servings in one 300g bag of chips. You want to have a daily calorie intake of 2000. But you have already eaten 1800 calories so far. So, the remaining calories to consume would be 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. To answer the question, let's go back to our first calculation using 4.16 servings in one bag of chips. Since your goal is to consume 200 calories out of 4.16 servings, we need to find what proportion of a single serving is equal to 200 calories. 200 / 250 = 0.8. Therefore, to calculate the amount in grams that you can eat while still consuming only 200 calories, you need to multiply this proportion by 300g (the total weight of the bag) (300 * 0.8 = 240g).
