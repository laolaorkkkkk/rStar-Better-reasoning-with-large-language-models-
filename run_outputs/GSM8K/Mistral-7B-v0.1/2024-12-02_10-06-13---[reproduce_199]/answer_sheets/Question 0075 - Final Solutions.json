If the top level has a square footage of 16, then it follows that the second level would have 8, the third level would have 4, and the fourth level would have 2. Average square footage of a level means you take all the square footages of a level together and divide it by four. So if there are four levels, then the average would be (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 8.

Firstly, we know that the surface area of the top level of the sand castle is 16. We also know that every layer below the top layer has a smaller area. It seems reasonable to assume that the size of each layer decreases exponentially, like the layers of a cake. This means that if we divide the top layer in half, it would yield two smaller layers with equal areas (if the top layer was divided into 4, then there would be four smaller layers with equal areas). The only remaining variable we need to find is the height of the tower. Let's say that the height of the tower is h. By dividing the top layer in half, we can create two smaller layers with equal areas. Then by dividing each of those layers in half again, we can create four smaller layers with equal areas. This pattern continues until the base level is reached. So let's count up all these layers: one top layer, two middle layers, four small layers, eight very small layers, and sixteen teeny tiny layers at the bottom. That adds up to twenty-one layers. So if we divide the total height of the tower by twenty-one, then we can find the height of each individual layer. That means that the height of each layer is h / 21. Now, the base of the pyramid is a square, so the square footage of the base layer is b^2, where b is the length of one side of the base. Therefore, the area of the base layer is b^2. To find out what value b needs to take, we use the fact that the area of the top layer is 16 and the formula for the area of a square, which is A=s^2. Since the top layer's area is 16 and the area of the bottom layer is b^2, we can write the following equation: 16 = b^2. Now we just solve for b and we get b = sqrt(16) = 4. So the length of one side of the base is 4 units long. This means that the area of the base layer is 4^2 = 16. Therefore, the average square footage of a layer is (16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16+16)/21, or 16/21 = 8/11.

Therefore, the total square footage of the sandcastle is 1. Now that we have the total square footage, we need to subtract the bottom level's square footage from it. This will give us the amount of area that was added by Luke. Using our formula, we would get ((1/2)^(n-1) x (top level's square footage)) - ((1/2)^n x (top level's square footage)).

I can help break it down so you understand. Let's start with the question. It says that Luke is building a four-leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, and asks for the average square footage of a level.\n\nNext, we need to use our knowledge of square footages. Each level has half the square footage as the level below it. This means that if the first level has a square footage of 16, the second level will have half that, or 8. The third level will have half of the square footage of the second, or 8 / 2 = 4. And the fourth level will have half of the square footage of the third, or 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the average square footage of a level. This is the sum of all the squares divided by 4. We already know the sizes of the levels, so let's add them up: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30. Then divide by 4: 30 / 4 = 7.5.\n\nSo the answer to your question is 7.5.
