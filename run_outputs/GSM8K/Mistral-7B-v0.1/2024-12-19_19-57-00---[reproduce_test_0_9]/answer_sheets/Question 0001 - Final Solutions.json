So, we need 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "We can calculate this using the following equation: (bolts of blue fiber) + (bolts of white fiber) = (total bolts). To solve this, we need to know the number of bolts of blue fiber and the number of bolts of white fiber. The problem tells us that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. Since 1/2 of a bolt of white fiber is equivalent to half a bolt, we can substitute \"half a bolt\" for \"1/2\". This means that it would take 1 bolt of white fiber to make a robe. Therefore, the equation becomes: (2 bolts of blue fiber) + (1 bolt of white fiber) = (total bolts). Solving this yields the result: 3 bolts of fiber.
