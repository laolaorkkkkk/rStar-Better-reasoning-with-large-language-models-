That means two thirds of the remaining vacuum cleaners. And so there were two thirds of the rest. Let's say she still had x vacuum cleaners when she went to the orange house. She sold half of these remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. That means that there were half of the remaining vacuum cleaners left at the orange house. This is known as the halfal part of the remaining vacuum cleaners. She didn't sell any other vacuum cleaners after the orange house. So she sold the fractional part, the secondal part, and the halfal part of the remaining vacuum cleaners. But we know that she started with five vacuum cleaners and ended up with only five. That's because she gave away the rest of them. That means the fractional part plus the secondal part plus the halfal part of the remaining vacuum cleaners is five. Let's substitute the values of the fractional part, the secondal part, and the halfal part into the equation: x + 2/3 + \u00bdx = 5. Add 2/3 and \u00bdx together to get 5/3 + x.

Simplifying: 2(x + z) = (x + 2) / 3 + z / 2. Multiplying both sides by 3 and simplifying again: 6(x + z) = (x + 2) + 3z / 2. Rearranging terms: 6z = 2 - (x + 2) + 3z / 2.

We know that X/3 + 2 + X/2 = 5. This equation can be rewritten as (3x/3) + (3x/6) + (3x/3) + (2/2) + (6x/6) + (x/2) = 5(3). Since 3x/3 + 3x/6 + 3x/3 + 2/2 + 6x/6 + x/2 = 5(3), we can simplify it as 3x/3 + 3x/6 + 3x/3 + 2 + 6x/6 + x/2 = 5(3). By combining like terms, we get 3x/3 + 3x/6 + 3x/3 + 2 + 6x/6 + x/2 = 3*5 + 2. Solving for x, we find that 3x/3 + 3x/6 + 3x/3 + 2 + 6x/6 + x/2 = 3*5 + 2 becomes 18x/6 + 2 + 18x/6 + 6x/2 = 3*5 + 2. Finally, solving for x, we find that 36x/12 + 2 + 36x/12 + 3x = 3*5 + 2, which reduces to 12x + 5. The number of vacuum cleaners she started with must be 12x, which is unknown. To solve for this unknown quantity, let's plug in the value of 5 for the number of vacuum cleaners left. We know that 12x + 5 equals 5 since she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.
