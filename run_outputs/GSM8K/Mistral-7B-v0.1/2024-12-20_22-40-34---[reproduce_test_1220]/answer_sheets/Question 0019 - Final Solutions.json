Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 4 miles per hour. Marissa walked the first 4 miles at 1 mile per hour and the next 2 miles at 2 miles per hour. This gives us two different speeds of walking. Next, let's calculate the total distance. Marissa walked 4 miles at 1 mile per hour and 2 miles at 2 miles per hour. This gives us a total distance of 6 miles. Now, let's calculate the total time. The problem tells us that Marissa will take 12 miles to finish the trail. However, we already know that she walked 6 miles at 4 miles per hour. Therefore, we need to calculate the time it took her to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour. Divide 6 miles by 4 miles per hour. This gives us a total time of 1.5 hours. Finally, we need to determine the remaining speed. We know that Marissa walked 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour. Since the remaining distance is 6 miles, we need to find out what speed Marissa would need to walk that distance. To solve for this, we use the formula: Distance / Time = Speed.

Therefore, we cannot assume that she walks at the same speed during those 2 hours. So we can only say that her average speed during those 2 hours is 1.5 mph, because that is the average of 1 mph and 2 mph. Since we know that she walks for 2 hours at that speed, let's substitute 2hours for it and see how much distance she would cover. We get 1.5x2=3miles.
