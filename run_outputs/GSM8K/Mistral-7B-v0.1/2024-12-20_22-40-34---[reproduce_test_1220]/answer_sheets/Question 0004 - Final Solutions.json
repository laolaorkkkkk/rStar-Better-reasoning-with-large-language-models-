First, let's find out how many cups of food Alice will give to her 20 chickens. Because Alice gives 3 cups of food to each chicken, she will give all of the chickens 3 cups of food times 20 chickens which is 20 x 3 = 60 cups of food. Next, let's figure out how much food she needs to give the 20 chickens in the evening. We know that in the morning and in the afternoon, she fed the chickens a combined amount of 40 cups of food. So we know that she needs to feed them an additional 20 cups of food in the evening (in order to provide a total of 60 cups of food). Therefore, she will need to give the chickens 20 extra cups of food in the evening. We also know that Alice gives 3 cups of food to each chicken in the evening, so 20 extra cups will be divided among 20 chickens. That means that each chicken will receive an extra cup of food in the evening. Each chicken already gets 3 cups of food in the morning and 3 cups of food in the afternoon, so we can just add 1 more cup of food in the evening. This means that Alice needs to give each chicken one extra cup of food. One extra cup times 20 chickens is 20 cups of food.
