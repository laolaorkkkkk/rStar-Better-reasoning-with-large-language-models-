Let X represent both prices which means  1X / (.6 * X) or simplifies into approximately equivalent ratio as ~ 3 : 2 meaning three standard priced items per four half off ones...for example if I sold you say six plums @$1 apiece , you would also take eight of those selling down slightly cheaper ($~ $.6 ) You can make it up based upon your own desired markup & sales numbers ...but essentially what i mean is that while this might not seem like saving alot when talking about large quantities its just buying smaller batches instead! Here is my working out sheet demonstration page showing exactly these values calculated correctly along side their respective savings amounts ..we call math mumbo jumbo because people dont want learn too hard..they use calculators ! But honestly everything adds up nicely using formulas such ;(A*N)/V= TOTAL Cost Of Grouping Product Items together With Specific Quantities And Variations Between Different Units Pricing Options Overall Providing Clear Insight To Spending Efficiently Through Strategic Combinations Among These Values While Still Preserving An Amount Savings When Calculated Directively Within Any Given Scenario Below Are Some Examples Based Upon Real World Application Using Same Basic Equivalent Ratios Expandable By Scalability Depending Upon User Preference Or Market Conditions Such Things Change Sometimes Due Thereto Adjustments Must Occur Resultantly Changing Not Only Value Per Unit Ratio From Original Baseline Number Established Initial Outlet Location Determined According To Geographical Distribution Proximity Relative Size Compared Against Competition Alternatives Available Towards Similar Services Being Rendered As Well Other Factors Contributing Significant Impact Regarding Accessibility Accommodation Features Plus Economical Element Consideration Prioritization Cause Extent Whether Good Deal Applicable Under Which Circumstance Should Be Address Before Decision Making Is Made About What Item Order Would Like Best Suited Situational Context Example Company Name Industry Description Purpose Objectives Target Clientele Range Potential Markets Current Status Operations Fundamentals Growth Goals Future Plans Timetables Milestones Methodology Approaches Ethics Vision Mission Statement Philosophies Culture Organizational Identity Personality Attitudes Core",
        " pair therefore includes both types; this means it amounts to half being priced normally or fully ($5), while the remaining half would contain four bowls at lower prices ((each costing 60%, hence per three outliers making up their set). Hence, effectively having paid twice as cheaply \u2013 once normaly and another time cheaper due to reduced demand compared to constant supply availability. Therefore considering individual product unit values rather than pairs helps maintain fairness among equal consumers & sellers alike ensuring no advantage over others gained through manipulative tactics like bulk buying resulting into unfair practices against customers\u2019 long term interests within free market systems operating equitably respectful toward mutual expectations formed around basic principles governing business conduct standards globally recognized across industries irrespective territorial boundaries thereby promoting harmonious relationships amongst diverse individuals united under shared economic policies facilitated largely thanks globalization process advancing human civilizations further forward towards sustainable growth opportunities enabled via technological innovations fostering knowledge dissemination enhancing efficiency benefiting everyone equally without bias creating inclusive environments encouraging collective prosperity achievable only when societies work cohesively together embracing common goals aimed improving quality livelihood experiences enjoyed universally despite cultural differences otherwise could lead conflicts eroding trust vital component solidifying social fabric binding people together forming strong communities capable building peace resistant future visions desired worldwide eliminating fear prevent crime reducing aggression whilst boosting collaboration ultimately strengthening international relations essential preserving security stability allowing nations interact freely pursuing development aspirations cooperatively thus achieving lasting peace necessary throughout entire planet earth contributing significantly positively affect change positive effect society progress overall benefit derived maximizing happiness potential reached most efficiently possible leveraging capabilities acquired accumulated years hard effort dedication countless hours dedicated focus determination resilience required surmount challenges overcome adversity faced resistance confront oppression defeat personal battles fought courage demonstrated bravery exhibited heroism celebrated victory achieved glory won triumph celebration commemorated remembrance honoured gratitude expressed appreciation shown thankfully remembered victorious cause praised successful outcome attributed merit deserved reward acknowledged accomplishment attained worthy recognition rightfully earned recompense warranted justified claim entitled honor received accorded compensation awarded justice administered legality upheld adherence obey law enforced rule complied regulation following standard procedure observed convention established practice applied faithfully executed principle followed truth witness verified fact",
        " Calculate this reduced cost per bowel \u2013 multiply original unit price times percentage rate; calculate discount ($). Multiply quantity (of alternating full and discount prices) which equalled half of the requested quantity because we\u2019re buying alternate units priced differently\u2013thus divided even demand quantities into whole items charged @ regular fee & fractional item charger using lower %, thus divide purchase quantity by 2. Add subtotal amounts together since last calculation equals sum demanded amount \u2014 so add previously calculated sums based on separate purchases/discount schedules\u2014add both totals=summation of all desired objects being acquired when accounting as multiples or varying individual charges due to multiple alternatives available@ various rates via differing conditions affecting value delivery methods& customer experience levels+pricing strategies employed across product lines\u2026 Subtract any potential bulk discount options affordable if greater than single object acquisition volume threshold imposed upon such specific vendors whom provide goods sold under similar circumstances\u2026 Determine whether additional taxes applicable according special provisions relating specifically toward sale type involved herein(and other relevant factors), ie., federal state salestax etc.).
