Add the delay induced because windows restarts every four times downloaded, as follows: ((2)*(((209,715,200/(2Gb)^4)-(209,715,200/(2Gb)^3)))=approximately 6 hours), meaning these three intervals make up about 2 hours extra [(2 hrs)+[((2)*(((209,715,200/(2 Gb)^4)=2]*([[(209,715,200/[(2 Gb)^3)]=(6))] approx).

It took Alisa another hour restoring the computer state because she needed those update files too... Which adds up to roughly doubled her initial estimated downtime; Therefore, if before all problems the estimate was around one century minus twice its first third approximately equaling seventy eighty six minutes..., Allowed ninety twenty seconds ago! Finally taking account both reboots plus expected slow down due repeated startups makes our best guess nearly fifty percent faster than anticipated....i.e., about sixty four hundredth less precisely thirty twelve thousand three hundred forty seven milliseconds equals just over zero point thirty nine seconds shortening waiting times somewhat..... At least until next month when windows release patches not requiring system starts etc during such critical tasks again resulting hopefully shorter overall durations albeit still mostly based upon estimates anyway!...
