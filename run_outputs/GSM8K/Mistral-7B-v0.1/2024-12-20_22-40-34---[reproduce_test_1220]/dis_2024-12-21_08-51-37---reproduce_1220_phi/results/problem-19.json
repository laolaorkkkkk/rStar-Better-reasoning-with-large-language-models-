To maintain an overall average of 4 mph over 12 miles, let `v` represent her required walking pace for the last segment\u2014calculate v using `(total time) x (`average speed`) = (total distance)`. Total time can also equal `[(distance so far/pace)]+[(remaining distance)/desired pace]`, yielding `((4+2)+(miles unknown))/(4+(x)). Thus we get [(4 mi/. . .)(pcies don\u2019t cancel out)=][(`time needed to cover all ground)`*(avg.]=[12mi\u00d7[4 mph).

Since marissa already expended about y minutes ({min}), use this value as your variable name here.

        " 1 or simply 4 mph. Next, consider that she also walked through other sections during this timeframe. Firstly, it says here that 'she then walked...the very next mile'. We didn't mention any unit before, but according to context I guess our best option would be hours so again considering just these numbers; since she spends only half an hour walking such section than hers pace ought indeed still stay close to  4mph too! Finally note well \u2013 although no explicit timings mentioned anywhere else about when/where specifically might happen -- nevertheless if everything remained otherwise unchanged throughout all parts discussed above\u2026then ultimately both things hold true regardless whether specific minute detail details provided earlier came forth clearly right away nor later down beneath ;) . Hence being consistent thus far everywhere seems natural..now go ahead & figure out which value comes closest enough around typical everyday life expectations generally ;-) Well looking back real quick ..so yeah looks like overall rates applied roughly equally across whole entire course except potential tiny deviations perhaps due slight weather factors not previously taken under account either hahaha~ Alright last thing though....notice something quite important missing within main points however called 'remaining travel distances yet ??? No clue really why nothing said particularly explaining precisely same exact way forward proceed towards goal itself :( Nevertheless , bearer my friend knows absolutely zero ideas himself hence couldn\u2019t tell you better sorry ~anyway moving along nicely anyway despite whatever hurdles posed already ^^ Good luck finding solution !

        " miles which also equals 1 hours. Therefore it confirms our initial statement. Finally, since time is equal to distance over rate, this implies velocity (Velocity). We know already that their average pace needs to match up with desired pace times(rate) so using algebra solving methodically: Distance=Rate*Time => Time=(Distance)/Ratio <==> Speed_Needed=(Total_miles/Desired_AverageSpeed)-[(FirstSegmentMileage+SecondSectionMileage)*1] This results into ((12-(4+2)) / 4)= (6/4 ) -> Result would not allow us achieve a perfect avg score but comes out close enough when rounded off properly hence approx.

        " From our calculations above, she covered 6 miles so far ((4+2=6)). Since it\u2019s already determined that the last leg shall take only one hour too; the overall time needed amounts to three hours(because every mile covers roughly half an hour). This makes the required avg speeds equate exactly according to requirements since during these three hours Marissa would effectively travel four times seven equals twenty eight altogether.(since all distances add up \u2013 this means you could also look directly into dividing sixteen over three\u2013to get ~five~miles/hour which translates straightaway to four mph when rounded off.) ",
        " hour \u2013 so far this amounts up to 4+2=6 hours travelled over 6 km. This means she still requires time equivalent to covering (12km / 4mph) =  3 more hours of walking or about ((6hrs/distance already covered)*((total hr needed)-(hours spent))). Therefore; 6/(dist_till_time)=[(total required)+(-tot_spent)/dist_already] => tot_speed=(required_d*sec/dt )+(remaining_d[end]/ds)]=> newSpeed=[requireD [x]+residualDist[-y]]-->newSped=.(. .)[Required Dets](reqAgt{val}(a)(min){opt}&&reqSubj(c)){ReqGranType}=.(nVal({v})&ResObjGrp{(g)}{OptPrfl}...

Total time thus far was indeed three hours since she spent those additional four units evenly distributed within these periods without pause nor detour because nobody said otherwise... But wait!

This leaves six kilometers unaccounted for ((12 km \u2013 Four initially covered Km)/Four hours taken so far).
