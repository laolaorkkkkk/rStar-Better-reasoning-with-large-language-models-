Let's say green fiber needs a total of 'x' amount for this expression because I don't know, but we'll use it here to make our example clearer: if you multiply x with four you get what? Here we go: If green fiber takes `x` amount of bundles then white fiber takes `1/2` amount of bundles which translates to `x/2`. That makes up all the fiber needed to make the shirt! So we want to know the total number of loops which equals green loops plus white loops. That would be x + x/2. To combine these fractions, find the least common multiple (LCM) or multiply both by 2. The LCM is 2 because we're multiplying `x` and `-2x` to form `2x` and `x`. Combine like terms to get `3x/2` (because adding x + (x/2) is the same as x(1 + 1/2)). However, since the exact amount of x isn't specified here, we'll just state the formula.
