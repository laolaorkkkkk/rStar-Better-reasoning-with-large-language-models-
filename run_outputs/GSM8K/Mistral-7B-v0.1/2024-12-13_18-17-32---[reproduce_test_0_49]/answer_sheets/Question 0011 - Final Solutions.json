The price of each type of pastry is as follows: Donut $68/dozen, Mini Cupcake $80/dozen, Mini Cheesecake $55/dozen. Next, let's identify the number of each type of pastry Toula purchased. The problem states she bought 3 dozen donuts, 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes. Therefore, the number of each type of pastry purchased is: Donut 3 dozen, Mini Cupcake 2 dozen, Mini Cheesecake 6 dozen. Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. We can do this using multiplication. The total cost of each type of pastry is (Donut 3 dozen x $68/dozen) + (Mini Cupcake 2 dozen x $80/dozen) + (Mini Cheesecake 6 dozen x $55/dozen). This simplifies to (3 dozen x $68) + (2 dozen x $80) + (6 dozen x $55). Which simplifies further to ($68 x 3) + ($80 x 2) + ($55 x 6). Calculating each part separately we get $68 x 3 = 204, $80 x 2 = 160, $55 x 6 = 330. Adding these together gives us 204 + 160 + 330 = 794.
