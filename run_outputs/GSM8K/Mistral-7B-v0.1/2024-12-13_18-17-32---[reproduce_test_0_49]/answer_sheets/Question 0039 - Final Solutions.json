Since Dana only has 6 hours, we need to figure out what T1 and T2 add up to 6. Let's start with T2, because we know what it multiplies by. Then, T2*B = 6/2 * B = 3B. Next, we can figure out T1. T1 + T2 = 6 hours. T1 + 3B = 6 hours. T1 = 6 - 3B. We substitute that back into our previous equation about running. T1A = (6 - 3B)A. This simplifies to T1A = 6A - 3BA.

So her walking speed is equal to 1/4 her running speed. And Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. So her skipping speed is equal to 1/2 her running speed. Let's write down those equations:\n\nEquation 1: 4x = (1/4)y, where x is the running speed, y is the walking speed, and the unit is miles per hour (mph).\nEquation 2: 2x = (1/2)z, where z is the skipping speed, in mph.\n\nSolve for y using Equation 1: y = 4x = (1/4)(4x) = x.\nSolve for z using Equation 2: z = 2x = (1/2)(2x) = x.\nSubstitute for x in Equation 1: y = 4z = (4/2)(z) = 2z.\n\nNow we know that Dana's walking speed is equal to twice her skipping speed. Also, since we are asked to find how many miles Dana can travel in 6 hours when she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, we can use this information to solve for z. Since Dana spends 1/3 of the time running, which means she skips for 2/3 of the time, and Dana walks for 2z miles in 2/3 of the time, we can say:\n\n(2/3)(2z) = 2z, where x is the skipping speed and z is the running speed.\n\nSince the unit is miles per hour (mph), let's solve for the time it takes Dana to skip 2z miles:\n\nTime = 2z / (2/3) = 2z*3/2 = 3z.\n\nSo Dana can skip 3z miles in 3z hours. But we already know that z = 4 miles per hour. Therefore, Dana can skip 3(4) = 12 miles in 3(4) = 12 hours.\n\nBut what about the other 2/3 of the time, when Dana is running? We know that Dana can run 4 times faster than she can walk, so Dana runs 4 miles in 1 hour. Also, Dana is running for 1/3 of the time, so Dana can run (4 * 1/3) = 4/3 miles in 4/3 hours.\n\nSince the unit is miles per hour (mph), let's add up how many miles Dana travels over the course of 6 hours:\n\nTotal distance = 2z + (4 * 1/3) = 2(4) + 4/3 = 8 + 4/3 = 8 + (3 * 4)/(3 * 3) = 8 + 12/9 = 8 + 4/3 = 20/3 = 6 2/3.\n\nSo Dana can travel 6 2/3 miles in 6 hours.\n\nFinally, since we want to find out how many miles Dana can travel in 6 hours if she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking, we can use our answer of 6 2/3 miles and multiply by 2 to get 13 miles, the final answer.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.

She can travel 4 miles. Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to run or walk one mile. It takes her four times as long to run than it does to walk. So if it took her one hour to walk, it would take four hours to run. Now, we know she runs for one third of the time and walks for two thirds of the time. So, if we run for one third of the time, we walk for two thirds of the time. Therefore, the time it takes to walk one mile is twice as long as the time it takes to run one mile. So, if it takes us one hour to walk, it takes two hours to run. Now, the amount of time spent running plus the amount of time spent walking equals 6 hours. So, we have 6 hours minus the amount of time it takes to run. This is equal to 6 hours \u2013 (6/2) hours, because two hours is equal to six divided by two. And this is also equal to 6 hours \u2013 3 hours because 3 hours is equal to 6 divided by 2, or (6/2). We can write this in another way as 6 hours \u2013 (6 \u2013 3) hours. Finally, this is equal to 6 hours minus 3 hours. And this is equal to 3 hours. So, if Dana runs for one third of the time, she runs for three hours. Now, since we ran for three hours, we ran three hours divided by four hours. Because three hours is equal to three divided by four, which is the same as 3/4.

She can walk at a rate of speed one fourth the speed she runs, so she walks at 1/2 hours per mile. This is how long she walks one mile. So, Dana runs for one third of the time. That is one third of 1/4d, or 1/(12d) hours. She skips for two thirds of the time. That is two thirds of 4 hours, or 8/3 hours. She walks for one third of the time. That is one third of 1/2 hours, or 1/(6d) hours. We add all this up. 1/(12d) + 8/3 + 1/(6d) = 1/6d + 8/3 + 1/(6d). We cancel out 1/(6d) and get 8/3d + 1/6d + 1/(6d) = 8/3d.
