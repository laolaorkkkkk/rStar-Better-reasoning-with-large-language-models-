They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. We can calculate the total distance traveled on the first day as follows: Both trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel westward, so their distances traveled would be the same. The trains traveled for 80 miles each, so the total distance traveled is 80 + 80 = 160 miles. To calculate the total distance traveled on the second day, we need to know the distance traveled by each train separately. Since the trains traveled northwards on the second day, their distances traveled would not be the same. One train traveled 150 miles while the other one still traveled 80 miles, because it started its journey later than the other one. Thus, the total distance traveled on the second day is 150 + 80 = 230 miles. The total distance covered by each train on the first day is half of the total distance traveled, since they both traveled for the same distance.
