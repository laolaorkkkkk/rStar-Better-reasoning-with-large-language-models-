Let's call Darrell's age as X and Allen's age as Y.\n\nFirstly, let's find the sum of Darrell's and Allen's ages. Since their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can set their ages as 7X and 11Y, which is just another way of writing the ratio.\n\nSo we have the equation 7X + 11Y = 180.

Hence, Allen's age 10 years from now is 10."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio. Their total age now is 180. Let's call Darrell's age D and Allen's age A. So, we can write the following equations: 7D + 11A = 180. And we need to solve for A+10. To find A+10, let's add 10 to both sides of the equation. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 7D + 11A + 10 = 190. This is now our new equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 7D + 11A - 10 = 190 - 10. Simplifying this, we get 7D + 11A - 10 = 180. Factoring out the 11 from the second term, we get 7D + (11A - 10) = 180. Simplifying further, we get 7D + (11A - 10) = 180. This is now our simplified equation. Now, let's divide both sides by 7. Doing so, we get 7D / 7 + (11A - 10) / 7 = 180 / 7. Simplifying further, we get D + (11A - 10) / 7 = 180 / 7. Finally, let's subtract D from both sides. Doing so, we get D - D + (11A - 10) / 7 = 180 / 7 - D. Simplifying, we get (11A - 10) / 7 = 180 / 7 - D. Multiplying both sides by 7, we get 11A - 10 = 180 - 7D. Finally, we take 11A - 10 + 7D = 180. Now, let's factor out 11 from the left side. Doing so, we get 11A + (-10 + 7D) = 180. Simplifying, we get 11A + (-10 + 7D) = 180. This is now our simplified equation. Next, let's add 10 to both sides. Adding 10 to both sides, we get 11A + (-10 + 7D) + 10 = 180 + 10. Simplifying this, we get 11A + (7D - 10 + 10) = 190. Simplifying further, we get 11A + 7D = 190. This is now our simplified equation. Next, let's divide both sides by 11. Doing so, we get 11A / 11 + 7D / 11 = 190 / 11. Simplifying, we get A + (7D / 11) = 190 / 11. Finally, let's subtract A from both sides. Doing so, we get A - A + (7D / 11) = 190 / 11 - A. Simplifying, we get (7D / 11) = 190 / 11 - A. Multiplying both sides by 11, we get 7D / 11 x 11 = 190 / 11 x 11 - 11A. Simplifying, we get 7D / 1 = 190 - 11A. This is now our simplified equation. Solving for D, we get D = (190 - 11A) / 7.
