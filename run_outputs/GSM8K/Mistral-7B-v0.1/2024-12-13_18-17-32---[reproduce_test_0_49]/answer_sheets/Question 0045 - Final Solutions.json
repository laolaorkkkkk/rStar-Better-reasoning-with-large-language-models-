Now that we know the number of articles written on Tuesday, let's find the number written on Wednesday. This can be calculated as the number of articles written on Tuesday multiplied by 2, which is 4 x 2 = 8.

It says she wrote 10 articles on Monday. 10 articles on Monday. Next, we want to know how many articles she wrote on Tuesday. It says she wrote 2/5 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. We can calculate this using multiplication. The number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is equal to 2/5 times the number of articles she wrote on Monday. So the number of articles on Tuesday would be 2/5 of 10, which equals 4. Finally, we need to find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday.
