According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can I eat if my daily calorie target is 2200 and I have already consumed 1900 calories? Let's calculate the total number of calories in one serving of chips by multiplying the number of calories per serving (250) by the number of servings (5).
