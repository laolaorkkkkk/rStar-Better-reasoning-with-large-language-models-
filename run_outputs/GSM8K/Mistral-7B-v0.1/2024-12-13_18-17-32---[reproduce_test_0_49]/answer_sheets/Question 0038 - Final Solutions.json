First let's find out how long John runs per day. As we can see, he runs 3 hours on the first day. And he runs half as much, or 1.5 hour, on the other two days. So he runs 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours in one day. Next let's see how many days does John run for a week. It says John runs 90 miles a week. That means he runs 90 miles / 6 hours = 15 miles/hours. That also means he runs 90 miles / 6 = 15 hours in a week. Therefore, he runs 15 miles/hour. The answer is: 15.\n\nHint 2: Let's think step by step. First let's figure out what the value of h is. We know that John runs 3 times a week. Also, John runs 90 miles a week. If he runs 3 times a week, the distance (miles) is the sum of three equal parts (since each part represents one day). But the speed (mph) is different for different days. This is why we need to use the information that he runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. We know that John runs 3 hours on the first day and twice as much, or 6 hours, on the other two days. So the running time is the sum of these three values. In other words, the running time is 3 + 3 + 6 = 12 hours. Now we know that John runs 90 miles in 12 hours. Therefore, he runs 90 miles / 12 hours = 7.5 miles/hours. Since the running time is 12 hours, John also runs for 12 hours in a week. Hence, he runs 12 hours in a week.
