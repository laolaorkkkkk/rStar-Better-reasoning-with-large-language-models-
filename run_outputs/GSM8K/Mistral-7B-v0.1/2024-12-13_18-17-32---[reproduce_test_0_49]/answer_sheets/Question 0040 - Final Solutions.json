We can use this formula: log(X)/log(2). Since X = 2^n, log(2^n)=log(X), so we can write log(2)^n=log(X), and take the exponent (the power). log(2)^n=log(X) --> n=log(X)/log(2). Let's substitute n into X = 2^n and get:\nX = 2^(log(X)/log(2))\nX = 2^(log(X)/log(2))\n\nSolving the above equation, we get: X = 4^(log(4)/log(2)), which is approximately equal to 8 years.
