Because the hourly rate for work below 40 hours is different from the hourly rate for overtime hours, we need to calculate this first. We know that Eliza worked 45 hours, so we can subtract 40 from it to get the number of hours below 40 hours. 45 - 40 = 5 hours below 40 hours. Multiply the number of hours below 40 hours by Eliza's hourly rate of $10 to find out how much Eliza earned for those 5 hours. We can multiply 5 by 10 to get the amount she earned. So, Eliza earned $50 for the 5 hours she worked below 40 hours. Next, let's calculate the number of hours Eliza worked above 40 hours. We know that Eliza worked 45 hours, and we have already calculated that she worked 5 hours under 40 hours, so we can subtract 5 from 45 to get the number of hours above 40 hours. 45 - 5 = 40 hours above 40 hours. Multiply the number of hours above 40 hours by the overtime hourly rate of 1.2 times the regular hourly rate. We know that Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, so we can multiply 40 by 1.2 * 10 to get the amount she earned for the 40 hours she worked above 40 hours. So, Eliza earned $480 for the 40 hours she worked above 40 hours. Finally, let's add up all of the amounts that Eliza earned. We calculated that she earned $50 for the 5 hours she worked below 40 hours, and we also calculated that she earned $480 for the 40 hours she worked above 40 hours. We can add these two amounts together to get the total amount that Eliza earned for this month.
