Suppose that Brandon's phone is X years old. Ben's phone is then X/2 years old. Suzy's phone is 2 years old. 2 is twice as old as X/2. Two is also half as old as 4 (which is Brandon's age). 2 is 2/4 of 4. Therefore, we can say X/2 is 2/4 of X. Using this information, we know that:\nX = 2*X/2\nX = 2*X/4\nX = 2*2*X/8\nX = 2*2*2*X/16\n...\nX = 2^n*X/(2^n)\nX = 2^n*X/2^n\nX = 2^n\nSince X = 2^n, let's find n. We can use this formula: log(X)/log(2). Since X = 2^n, log(2^n)=log(X), so we can write log(2)^n=log(X), and take the exponent (the power). log(2)^n=log(X) --> n=log(X)/log(2). Let's substitute n into X = 2^n and get:\nX = 2^(log(X)/log(2))\nX = 2^(log(X)/log(2))\n\nSolving the above equation, we get: X = 4^(log(4)/log(2)), which is approximately equal to 8 years.
