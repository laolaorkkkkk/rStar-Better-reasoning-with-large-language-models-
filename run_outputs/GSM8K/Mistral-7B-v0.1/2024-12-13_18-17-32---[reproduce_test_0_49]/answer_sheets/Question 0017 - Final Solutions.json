Let's see if that matches the amount stated in the problem. 1000 dollars per month times 12 months is 12000 dollars a year. The problem says she makes 12000 dollars a year. So that means she makes 20 dollars per hour teaching. Now we can find out how much she makes teaching 35 hours per week. That's $20 * 35 = 700 dollars. And as a coach, she gets 30 dollars per hour and 15 hours per week, so that's $30 * 15 = 450 dollars per week. Adding those together yields 700 + 450 = 1150 dollars per week. 1150 dollars per week times 50 weeks is 57500 dollars per year. So Jill makes $57500 per year.

Similarly, $450 * 50 is also $35,000. This is Jill's salary for coaching in a year. Finally, add together her earnings from teaching and from coaching. It's still $35,000.
