First we need to identify the values of the various parts of this problem: starting price ($80,000), cost of repairs ($50,000), and new value after the repairs ($130,000). Then we need to figure out what percentage increase the new value represents relative to the starting price. We can do this by dividing the difference between the new value and the starting price by the starting price: 130,000 - 80,000 / 80,000 = 60,000 / 80,000 = 1.5 (60,000 is the difference between the new value and starting price). Finally, since the problem says that the value increased by 150%, we know that 150% = 1.5. Since 1.5 is equal to the result of dividing the difference between the new value and the starting price by the starting price, we can say that 1.5 is also equal to the ratio of the difference between the new value and the starting price to the starting price itself, or (130,000 - 80,000) / 80,000. Solving for 80,000, we get (130,000 - 80,000) / 1.5, which is equal to 50,000.

First, Jack bought the house for $80,000. Then he put in $50,000 worth of repairs. That brings the total to $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Next, the value increased by 150% from the original price. So the new value would be the old value (80,000) times 1.5, which equals 120,000. Finally, since the value went up by 40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000), the profit made is 40,000.
