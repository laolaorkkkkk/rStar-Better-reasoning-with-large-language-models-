John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent 240 on blue ties which costs 60 dollars each. So, first, let's identify the price of red ties. Since the problem states \"red ties cost 50% more than blue ties\", we can calculate the price of red ties using the formula: red ties cost = (blue ties cost * 1.5). Or, red ties cost = (60 * 1.5) = 90. Next, let's identify the number of blue ties. The problem states John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of blue ties is half the number of red ties. So, if there are x red ties, then the number of blue ties is x/2. Next, let's identify the number of red ties. We know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. We also know that the number of blue ties is x/2. So, the number of red ties must be x/2*2=x. Next, let's calculate the amount spent on red ties. Since we know the price of red ties is 90, and there are x red ties, we can calculate the amount spent on red ties using the formula: red ties cost = x*90. And finally, let's calculate the amount spent on blue ties. We know that John spent 240 on blue ties that cost 60 dollars each. So, the amount spent on blue ties is 240. To summarize, John spends 240 on blue ties that cost 60 dollars each. Since the problem states \"red ties cost 50% more than blue ties\", we can calculate the price of red ties using the formula: red ties cost = (blue ties cost * 1.5). So, the price of red ties is 60*1.5=90. Also, since the problem states \"John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties\", we can calculate the number of blue ties using the formula: blue ties = x/2. And since the number of blue ties is x/2, we can calculate the number of red ties using the formula: red ties = x. Finally, we can calculate the amount spent on red ties using the formula: red ties cost = x*90. Putting all this together, John spends 240 on blue ties that cost 60 dollars each, and spends 90*x on red ties that cost 90 dollars each. To summarize, John spends 240 on blue ties that cost 60 dollars each. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the price of red ties is 90 dollars each. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of blue ties is x/2. The number of red ties is x, because John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.

John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Blue ties cost 50% less than red ties. John bought blue ties for 60 dollars each. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Let's solve this equation. We start off by calculating the price per blue tie, which is 50% of the price per red tie. 50% of the price per red tie is 50% * Price per red tie. This means we have to multiply 50% of the price per red tie by 0.5 to get the actual price per blue tie. So price per blue tie = 50% of Price per red tie * 0.5. This is also equivalent to Price per blue tie = Price per red tie * 0.5, since 50% is equivalent to 0.5. So let's replace 50% with 0.5. Then the equation becomes Price per blue tie = Price per red tie * 0.5. Now we have to solve for Price per red tie. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.5. This will cancel out the 0.5 on the right side. So Price per blue tie / 0.5 = Price per red tie. Now we can substitute back in what we know about price per blue tie and get Price per red tie = Price per blue tie / 0.5. So we have found the price per red tie! Now we have to solve for the number of blue ties. We know that John bought blue ties for 60 dollars each, so the price per blue tie is 60. We also know the price per red tie, so let's plug that into the equation we just solved. Price per red tie = Price per blue tie / 0.5 = 60 / 0.5 = 120. Now we can find the total number of blue ties bought by multiplying the number of red ties by two. We'll call the number of red ties <RED TIES>. Then, we can write Total number of blue ties = 2 * Number of red ties = 2 * <RED TIES>. Now we have everything we need to solve for <RED TIES>. We just have to divide both sides of the equation by 2. This will cancel out the 2 on the left side. So Total number of blue ties / 2 = Number of red ties. Now we can substitute in what we know about the total number of blue ties and get Number of red ties = Total number of blue ties / 2.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get 60 x (x + x) = 240. Simplifying, we get 60x + 60x = 240. Multiplying out the x terms, we get 120x = 240.

John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let's call them x red ties and y blue ties. We know that the red ties cost $60$, and the blue ties cost $60$ each. We also know that the price of the red ties is twice the price of the blue ties. So, the price of the red ties is $120$ times the price of the blue ties. The total price of all the ties is the sum of the price of the blue ties and the price of the red ties. So, the total price is $60$ times the price of the blue ties plus $120$ times the price of the blue ties. This can be written as $180$ times the price of the blue ties. We are also given the information that John spent $240$ on blue ties that cost $60$ each. We can use this information to substitute $60$ times the price of the blue ties with $240$ in the equation. The total price is then $240$ plus $120$ times the price of the blue ties. This can be simplified to $180$ times the price of the blue ties. We can solve this equation using basic algebra. First, we subtract $240$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us $120$ times the price of the blue ties equals $180$ times the price of the blue ties minus $240$. Then, we divide both sides of the equation by $120$. This gives us the price of the blue ties equals $(180$ times the price of the blue ties) divided by $120$. Finally, we multiply both sides of the equation by $120$. This gives us the price of the blue ties times $120$ equals $180$ times the price of the blue ties. We can now solve for the price of the blue ties. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $180$. This gives us the price of the blue ties times $120$ divided by $180$ equals the price of the blue ties. Since the price of the blue ties is equal to both sides of the equation, we can simplify the equation to $120$ equals $120$ divided by $180$. This can be further simplified to $1$ equals $1$ divided by $180$. Since $1$ divided by $180$ is not an integer, the original equation cannot be solved.

Let's start with the blue ties. The price of the blue ties is $60*$x. This means John spent $60*$x dollars on blue ties. Next, let's calculate the price of the red ties. The price of the red ties is $120*$x. This means John spent $120*$x dollars on red ties. Finally, we can add up the prices of the blue ties and red ties to get the total amount John spent. So, the total amount John spent is $60*$x + $120*$x. We can simplify this expression by combining like terms. So, the total amount John spent is $(60+120)*$x. This is the same as $180*$x.

Let's first find out how many red and blue ties John bought. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. That means he bought 2 times more red ties. Let's call the number of red ties, r, and let's call the number of blue ties, b. The equation is then 2r = b. We can solve this equation using algebra: we divide both sides by 2: 2r/2 = b/2, or r = b/2. Let's call the price of the blue ties, p. Then, John spent $240 on blue ties. So, 240/p = x. We can substitute p with 60 to get 240/60 = x. Finally, to get the price of the ties, we need to add together the price of the blue ties and the price of the red ties. Since the blue tie costs $60$ each, we multiply it by x. And since the red tie costs $60$ each too, we multiply it by r. Then we sum up these two prices to get: 240 + 60r.
