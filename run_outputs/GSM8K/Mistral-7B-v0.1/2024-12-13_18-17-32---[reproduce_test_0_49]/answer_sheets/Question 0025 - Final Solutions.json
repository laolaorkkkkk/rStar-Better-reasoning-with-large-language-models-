Marie ordered one chicken meal which was $12. She ordered 5 packs of milk for $3 each, 4 apples for $1.50 each, and boxes of pizza. The total cost of all this was $50. She also ordered some boxes of pizza. Each box of pizza costs $8.50. Let's call the number of boxes x. We can figure out x like this: 12 + 3 * 5 + 1.5 * 4 + 8.5 * x = 50. 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.5 * x = 50. 8.5 * x = 23. x = 23 / 8.5 = 2.72... The answer is: 2.\n\nHint 2: What was the original question?
