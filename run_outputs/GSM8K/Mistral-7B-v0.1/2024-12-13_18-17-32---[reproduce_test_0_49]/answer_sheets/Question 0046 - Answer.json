On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes. At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 250 different cups of coffee. If she had 30 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThen, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 100+x.\nIf she used 250 Post-it notes at work and had 30 left, then the total she had was 250+30=280\nSo, 100+x=280\nSubtracting 100 from each side, x=280-100=<<280-100=180>>180 Post-it notes.\n#### 180", "gold_answer": "180"}
