We know Samantha is currently 31, which means Samantha is not yet 25. So let's calculate the number of years from when Samantha was born through year ratey until Samantha becomes 25. Thus, the number of years is 25 - (31 - 6) years or 25 - 25 years. This calculation implies that Samantha was born 6 years before_ratey_who became Samantha, therefore Ratey was already born during Samantha\\''s birthdef period. So Ratey was born 6 years ago.%.",
