Let x be the sum of her distances traveled. Hence x=32w+4w = 36w. We need to find w. From our earlier equation w equals to distance she walked. Total distance traveled equals 32w+4w = 36w. Simplifying, we get 36w=24 (since distance she can walk was found out to be 4 miles in total during the whole hour by previous calculations), then solving for w you get w=2/3.
