        " so he earns 15x15= $225. Each game costs him $20 and if he was able to purchase 8 games before spending only 5$ remaining means it equals $225-$5=$220 spent overall. As one game takes precisely $20 cash out of this budget amount (as we assumed), the maximum number of items purchased would indeed correspond exactly to its price ($20/game).

This leaves us with remaining money as 65 dollars which proves our calculations correct since according to question statement he needs exactly this amount plus one extra dollar hence making sure no other expenditures occurred during sale process besides specified above details leading us to conclude that initially planned calculation was precise i.e; starting funds=remaining unspent balance+(expenses*units)=(starting_funds+balance)*gameprice/unitso calculating using equation mentioned earlier yields same results thus confirmation its successful completion here goes:$160+$5=$165total initial price*$number$/$per item$=$new price found within problem contextwhich further equatesto:(initial fundamount-$moneyleft)/actualgamepricetime($160/$20)$=(earnedfromlegossets)-noofvideo gamedecidedpurchasenow=$(answerfoundduringcalculationforgamesboughthereinafter)(in numerical formthatmathequationsjustmentyieldsto)[$(answersetbackonproblemstatementbaseorconditiontriedtoproblematfirstfindoutwhatthingsaregoingonsafeexploringthiswayandthenfigureourwaysaroundwhenwegottothepointsolutionisconfirmedaccuratelyprovidingnecessaryinfoconclusionformedafterproceedingsomuchclearerunderstandingshaperecoveredsomeclaritywherewasthesorryhadntexpectedquestionbutdid understandyourdesiretherewithalmostcompletescriptnotbeyondbasicneededdetailsanyotherinputpromisecorrectfollowupifrequiredaskmorequestionsaboutsametopicfocusneedadditionalinsightsbetterknowcontextexactnumberspreciselyexpectedresolutionsconfirmablecorrectlyacknownsthatimassurgeveryonegoodlucknexttimealwayskeeplearningeverythinghelpfulresponsesappreciatepositivefeedforwardwillcontinueeffortmakingensureeverthingmatchesrequirementsmustrevisitallbeforefinalizedansweragainguessyougetrightfinishlastsentencemaybeevenjohndoesnthavelegalsonleaveoffrest",
