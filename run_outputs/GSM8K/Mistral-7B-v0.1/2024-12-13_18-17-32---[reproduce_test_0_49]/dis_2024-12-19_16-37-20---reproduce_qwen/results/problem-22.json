As observed above, most studies found similar results across different regions regardless whether the subjects completed cognitive training during periods separated either temporally distant due to retention intervals following completion phases, spatially proximate before beginning new task blocks within session structures, among others.

Hence, Billy only managed to make sales equivalent to half of those offered when every single person decides not to purchase anything else alongwith their already planned purchases (as mentioned) ie; all potential additional products became 'lost'. To elaborate further though while we could consider it as a good measure about people who decided against impulse or want fulfilment beyond basic necessity during shopping experience etc.; however directly attributing this scenario towards such conclusions would require substantial evidence which isn\u2019t provided herein hence maintaining our focus remains upon counting purely numerical figures associated thus leading to said calculations being based strictly around simple arithmetic sans deductions made due to conjectures pertaining indirect influences behind consumer behaviors eg like non-purchased items/additional services perhaps rendered gratification seeking motivation alterations thereby leaving pure numeral calculation devoid subjective interpretational bias aside.. Therefore keeping within direct quantifiable facts without involving speculative assessments its understood why numbers indicate merely quantity purchased despite possible factors potentially affecting overall sale volume yet impact doesn't appear reflected through explicit means currently detailed therefore providing groundwork essential clarifying just plainly what actually transpired regarding actual transactions conducted regardless psychological nuances influencing them whether realised consciously unconsciously too nor otherwise!

        " didn\u2019t buy anything but their purchase count towards sales which isn't zero or negative it just means nobody wanted what was being offered hence why you say no transactions occur here we aren't counting these as nothing because not purchasing doesn't equate to having made NO transaction ,the sale still happened even if people opt out . Therefore : Total sold -> (first set )+ second Set+=total   Sales=Total=(First Set) +(Second Set)= Number Of Customers That Bought And Their Amount Of Purchase=> Sellings =   3 + 4     =>So , billy managed To make up 7 sales when all told , only about half paid full ..that would probably mean maybe around ~$4 off overall since average dvd costs like~~$12 this might seem insignificant relative totals however its good math practices never discard details whether small amounts cause big shifts especially while adding numbers :) Good luck !!! Hope I helped clarify everything! It seems your message ended abruptly.
