This means this information cannot help solve our particular question so we ignore these numbers altogether; however let us still briefly explain why people might prefer bulk purchases like those offered here before moving forward further down below along w/our calculations! First off though knowing exactly whether either scenario saves money isn\u2019t necessarily always obvious unless someone wants clarity about differences etc., especially considering discount pricing structures vary greatly among different vendors including supermarkets & other places selling goods directly consumable vs storefront businesses whose sales volume impact their ability lower prices overall due economies related both locally within communities plus wider regions nationwide thus creating opportunities through competition resulting various rates paid differently based purely upon supply chain factors alone without factoring into consideration just raw costs associated thereby influencing decisions makers choosing certain methods compared others instead solely thinking financially versus strategically regarding efficiency during distribution processes involved across entire logistics systems operating globally worldwide year round regardless specific events happening temporarily limited timescales occurrences short term trends sporadic fluctuations temporary anomalies occasionally recurring cycles reoccurring periodicity periodic repetition regular intervals frequent episodes happenamonthltyannuallybiweeklyquarterlysemi monthlyetceteraperiodictemporarycyclesrecurrentrepetitionsregularintervalsthroughout yearsoveralltimebasedinfluencedprimarilysoleconomicswhilestrategicallyrelatedoperationalefficiencyencompassingsupplychainmanagementnationwidelyacrossglobalregionworldunlimiteddimensiontimelineaslongandextendeddurationimpactconsumptioncapabilityproductiondemandsdistributionchannelssalespricesqualitycommodityeffectivematrixfactorswithlocalgovernmentregulatoryframeworksexternalsensitivityresponsemarketchangespublicpolicyadaptionscheduleplanningprioritiestimulusmeasuresinterventiontypesurgerycrisispreemptionsposteventevaluatingsituationalflexibilitycontainingvariablestrategymultifariousconsideratechoicesproactiveapproachescoordinatedeffortsmasterplanneedsalignedexecutiondecisionsmadeincontext",

Therefore calculate the average spending value considering both scenario possibilities \u2013 using full units when enough stock exists else just calculating for requirement basis unit costs.

Hence, if one yogurt costs around $1.25, Terry spends about 90 * $1.25=$112.5 or rounding up it becomes approx. $113. Since this question involves approximate prices not exact ones hence your dollar sign before decimal point ($) can go away. Your correct interpretation without considering approximation would result in exactly half way between 113 and 114 dollars; let's settle this ambiguity down though here because both answers seem right depending upon whether you rounded up earlier calculated value($112.5) or considered slightly higher values but less than second place possibility i.e.,$114.
