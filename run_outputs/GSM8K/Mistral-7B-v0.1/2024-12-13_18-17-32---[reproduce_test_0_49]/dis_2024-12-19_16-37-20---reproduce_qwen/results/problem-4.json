To find the exact requirement you would simply perform \\( \\frac{Total\\_Amount}{Number\\ Of\\_Chickens} \\) using your result as input data into function calculate_required_amount() which returns approximately \\[ eval((40*0.15)/20)\\approx \\boxed{0.3}\\] .

Multiply this value against one third since we know every hen consumes equal amounts through those times but still less than what would normally occur because not every animal can consume full capacity; thus subtracting enough until reaching only once again halfway into consumption which equals approximately about four hours later . This results in having around roughly seven pounds worth over time while considering factors such including digestion process amongst other relevant issues related directly towards proper nourishment requirements within certain parameters like age / sex groups etc\u2026 However using simple mathematics makes calculating quite easy here : Total daily food required=Total Food divided By Number Of Hens Which Equals To(Average Amount Consumed Per Hen)=((Morning Feeding+(afternoon Feeding))-(AmountUsed During Morning+ Afternoon))/(NumberofHens)= ((SummarizedFigure From Previous Step)-[(Both Times Taken Combined)+Evenings])/NumberOfChickens=(Previously Calculated Value Here\u2013([All Chicks Get At Once]+Reduction Due Later In Time))/TotalCount).

As such Alice initially plans providing only twice as much food compared to one serving i.e., (2*3)=6 cups/meal.
