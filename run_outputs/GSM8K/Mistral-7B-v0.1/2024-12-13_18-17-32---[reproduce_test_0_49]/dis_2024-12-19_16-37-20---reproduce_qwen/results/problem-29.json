Gloria knows these amount combined exceeds what could be spent on any single pair but rather amounts up to the difference mentioned \u2013 this being exactly 'five bucks'. Hence, we can infer that if these items cumulatively represent just over half her available expenditure yet stay within it due precisely because no additional cash enters play outside either option individually; only subtraction occurs herein indicating merely part payment towards alternative selections without needing full financial compensation overall hence reducing such figures thusly calculated ($=99).

Thus, all these statements combined indicate something about another category such as 'the type' making us conclude that Choice C ($5 Boots Fit All Budgets$) makes sense since neither exceeding nor falling short its constraints related to budgets and pricing mentioned previously i.e., only considering single item not multiples items like stated priorly thus rendering them irrelevant hence no valid selection exists within provided options directly connecting back specificively detailed data points shared earlier therefore leaving option sole reliant upon logical assumptions rather direct tie into factual information specified initially leading towards decision ground primarily hinge point root derived exclusively via inferences deduced through process highlight encompass entire discourse culmination arriving conclusive assertion without need arising further scrutiny over presented elements despite apparent absence explicit corroborative linkage ensuring alignment coherence completeness thereby resolving ambiguity potentially caused interpretational misalignments possibly influenced additional contextual nuances yet maintain unambiguous confirmability integrity reinforcing confidence substantiated truthfulness affirming decided best match choice align closely reflect underlying principles encapsulated initial inquiry",
