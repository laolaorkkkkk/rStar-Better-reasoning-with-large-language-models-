It can also mean sixty minutes since these units convert directly into other similar measurement systems i know we measure work here in feet pounds etc using inches yards centimeters kilograms miles etc but even just looking within our own country like us u s americans who prefer distance measured not unlike most residents around me , although european countries such britain england usually go kilometer whereas australians use metric system kilometers while others still rely upon old fashion standard unit foot sometimes called ell maybe shank leather when referring specifically lengthwise objects though majority uses meter currently across nations worldwide regardless location unless special circumstances apply otherwise why worry yourself needlessly unnecessary complicated calculations beyond scope present current task requiring simple solution rather straightforward approach understanding basic arithmetic principles applied appropriately thus avoiding confusion mistakes caused due unclear instructions lacking clarity making process harder unnecessarily complicating matters simply stating requirement 'x y z plus minus greater equal less ..etc.' none involved terms undefined variables ambiguous meaningless symbols equations complex algebraic expressions difficult trigonometry advanced calculus methods too numerous irrelevant figures confusing graph tables scatter diagrams charts illustrations photos videos animations computer programs software applications hardware tools machinery parts equipment devices manual processes technical procedures professional services contractors architect engineers technicians scientists researchers academics professors students scholars graduates lecturers university staff members professionals working corporate office employees managerial supervisors executive board directors chairman officers vice president treasurer secretary general administrative assistant clerks janitors maintenance personnel drivers truck driver tractor operator farmer farmhand laborer construction worker plumber pipe fitter painter electrician carpenter masonry craftsman welder smelter millworker baker chef cook kitchen helper housekeeper washer cleaner drycleaner tailor seamstress dressmaker laundress maid gardener grounds manicurist masseuse massage therapist personal hygiene beautician nail tech barber stylist hairdresser hairdo makeup artist wig maker perfumer cosmetologist fragrance consultant essential oils creator inventor entrepreneur venture capitalist angel investment",

Thus we get((6)/(24))[(times you want daily)][how many weeks]. You may see another way here [(number_of_walks]*number_animals); this calculates only if those things don\u2019t change during different periods but I used my previous solution because what was asked doesn\u2019t specify any changes so every value stays same throughout a specific period like our case \u2018week'. Our question asks about \u201cA single unit\u201d which implies keeping everything constant through entire calculation i believe hence why I multiplied second equation as well even though not needed due no other info available... What can make upfront work easier when calculating long formulas especially while having multiple parameters or steps involved?(like setting variables instead using numbers etc)? One method could set variable 'x=total amount spent walking pets', let say its equal z\u2026..which means original inputted data gets rewritten based off new definitions eg:(z=time taken )=(a+b)+c+(y) -> Z=(walls plus bedrooms plus windows). Note this reduces complex arithmetic computations making them less prone human errors.(this technique also helps avoid confusion later!)
