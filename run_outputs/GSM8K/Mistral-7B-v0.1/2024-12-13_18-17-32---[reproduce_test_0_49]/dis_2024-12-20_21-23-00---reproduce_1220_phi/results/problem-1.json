Given values herein translate directly without actual data about both colors existing fully hence resulting calculations yield Black(Whole) which represents no matter the state because neither color seems present wholly initially only part matters but not sum thus replacing numbers becomes impossible firstly all details missing therefore requiring assumption else default substitution according common sense such black would equal nothing even though unknown portion could exist separately still remaining unaccounted leading towards conclusion Whole+No+=Sum==Nothing Where Yes And No Have Value Equality Cancelling Each Other Out While Possibly True But Unverifiable As Direct Information Lackful Without Additional Context Further Speculation Off Possible Amount Reduced To Zeros Absent Verifying Data Hence Default Zero Assignment Required Unless Extra Info Provided Which Not Applicable Here Therefore Most Logical Choice Select Nullium Nullitiun Sensi Conclusion Submit Your ",
