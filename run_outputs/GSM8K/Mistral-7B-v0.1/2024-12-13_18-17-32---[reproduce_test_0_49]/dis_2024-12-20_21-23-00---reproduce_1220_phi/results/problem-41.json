This means that if Polly holds onto the Sapphire Gem while standing further out beyond Mount Farbo but still below its peak area near Dragon Rock(not past 1000 feet), namely anywhere up till about half way down or around  700 feet above ground level depending also on wind direction etc., which was enough time needed before moving forward ,she would effectively strike any part target zone directly beneath Dragons Eye Lair during nighttime attack missions because this new position allows safe evasion .

Assuming standard bow trajectory models apply, if you imagine yourself looking downrange towards the target point such as underneath Mt Fujiyama standing next door \u2013 just like what happens often during longbow training sessions while watching YouTube tutorials online\u2026 We might find ourselves staring into darkness beyond these limits whilst trying desperately grasp them all together! As per usual physics rules regarding projectile motion problems including ones related specifically toward archery equipment use cases even further away distances may become involved due mostly both frictional losses across different parts surfaces plus air resistance forces acting opposite way around arrows before leaving bowside ends thereby eventually causing loss overall efficiency overtime making every shot take longer period time compared against initial attempts made earlier years ago using similar designs...

Therefore we multiply 500 ft (her normal throwing ability) by 3, resulting into a maximum possible throw length if using the help of the jewel which equals 1500 feet. As said before, it takes about 1000ft for those fiery blasts to consume all objects nearby. Hence subtracting the safe zone size i.e., 'dragons range', away from zero(meaning starting point), you realize that your optimal position would ideally land right around or exceed past halfway mark as opposed to staying too close inside its radius due to safety reasons considering unpredictable elements such weather conditions etc . So what I am basically asking here; find midpoint value/distance=half*range\u2248difference+(start+finish)/2=(endzone-safezone)(EndZone-SafeZone)=(250*(1000-(-250))=((250)*(1250)=312500~).

Since without it she throws up to 500 feet, which falls under the range of the dragon\u2019s fire (which reaches up to 1000 feet), we need first find out what thrice this original throwing power would be: `Polly_with_gem = Original_throw*3` or, substituting our values, `Polly_with_gem=500*3`. That means if polly holds the Gemstone while aiming, she gets able to shoot as long as she stands somewhere near `(Dragon max range)-(Distance covered without gem)`. Thus, taking those numbers away we get`, Resultant Distance= DragonMaxRange -(OriginalThrow*(NumberOfTimesGemIncreases)) Or , Final",

Since every additional foot makes someone further out riskier but doesn't affect those already beyond safety zones; therefore, all locations up till Dragon\u2019s Flame (up until the boundary limit set) remain unsafe even if standing next to the giant who holds power over their thrown object(gem). Hence we conclude anyone throwing anywhere under 1 kilometer away remains perilously close while others may stay safely apart depending solely upon personal ability or chance!

However based solely off ground level assumption & normal human capabilities plus keeping simple terms ,it allows us derive minimum possible footfall safety point equals double initial maximum thrown length provided under ideal condition \u2013doubled twice due presence enhancement through Sapphire power= Double Distance With Gem Stone(Initial Maximum)=Double Twice More Safety Point Foot Length Equals Total Reach To Safe Zone From Current Stand Position Thus ",
