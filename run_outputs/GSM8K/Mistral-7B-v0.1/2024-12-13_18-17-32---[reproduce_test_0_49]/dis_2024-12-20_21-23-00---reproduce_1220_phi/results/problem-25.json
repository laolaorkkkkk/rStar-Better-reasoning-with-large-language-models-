Therefore , something seems wrong about either initial quantities mentioned here nor its associated price tags especially taking into account only positive numbers involved i.e integers.. However based solely off provided information without considering any mathematical errors perhaps another reasonable way could involve assigning variables like let X denotes quantity related terms while Y being denominated values hence having equations set representing relationships among them say Z(X) signifying overall combined value per unit itemized goods & services whereas Q stands embodying said summed individual outlays : Dx+Pz=(TotCost)+Q ; thus forming connection linking above enumerations via algebraically solving yields conclusion ~ four units valued product deliverance within this context align well fitting under stipulations delineating pricing spectrum detailed earlier thereby corroborating proposed solution ..

Divide this leftover payment into the price per box: $17 / $8.50/box = approximately 2 boxes (since you cannot buy half a box). Therefore, Marie bought about 2 full boxes of pizza. However, as we deal only with whole numbers when considering quantity like orders or purchases without partial amounts implied typically due to discrete units, it indicates Marie might actually have purchased exactly 2 full boxes along with not reaching enough additional change required for another complete unit; thus confirming our calculation stands validated under these constraints hence round down considerations absent explicit cents provided would suggest exact purchaseable integers applied.)",

You either pay exact change or overshoot slightly but never less than what things actually worth according to their set pricing.
