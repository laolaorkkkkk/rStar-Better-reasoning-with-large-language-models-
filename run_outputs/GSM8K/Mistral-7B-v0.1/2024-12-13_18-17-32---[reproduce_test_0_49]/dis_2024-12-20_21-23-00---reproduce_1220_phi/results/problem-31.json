Third estimates say double (2x) what the other believed resulting in;   2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 bean. These three numbers can easily summed up leading us to the result being;    100 + 70 + 200 = <<100+70+200=370>>370 . Since all these people contributed equally to our problem here just divide our cumulative sum above i.e., 370 divided by the contributors i.e., 3 results into approximately ;        370/3 ~<<370/3=123.33333333333333>>123 or about hundred twentythree ballestones!
