Thus solving this leads us finally answering whether what our question wanted was Speed during those sessions or just average daily session length ?

However; while calculating exact figures considering individual distances might yield slightly different numbers but both approaches provide close approximations ensuring accuracy isn't compromised even without actual specific details such as varying paces among individuals performing physical activities like jogging\u2013this serves well generally whenever need arises not necessarily sticking strictly onto precise mathematical calculations especially involving human behavior related aspects beyond strict numerics alone.\u201d Henceforth let us simplify things further\u2026and reduce errors possibly introduced due any slight miscalculation or omission thereby allowing ourselves peace mindedly knowing everything fits seamlessly within logical boundaries provided henceforward~ Enjoy playing games!!:) It helps enhance skills indirectly through improving concentration abilities making players smarter than before having fun simultaneously :) Also don't forget \u2013 stay fit always keep moving !!!!

        " John ran approximately 30mph (Miles Per Hour). Because if you take one mile which takes him an hour to finish; therefore every third minute he covers another mile so that means during these minutes speed equals about sixty point zero mph or precisely thirty(30) but let us round off our calculation since when dealing with real life situations especially those involving humans , things like pacing, walking upright etc tend not to fit perfectly into whole numbers . Therefore I believe it safe enough until proven otherwise say ten percent less than actually calculated using different criteria such factors affecting motion namely human variation among others may cause slight differences even though theoretically equal under ideal conditions \u2013 thus resulting overall effect being relatively very close despite initial accuracy level achieved via previous methodology employed here.. However keep mind while considering changes made above also account both possibilities possible scenarios occurring simultaneously rather assuming all events happening individually making sure results fall within acceptable margin ranges without drastically deviating significantly away causing confusion later down road! But still remember nothing moves exactly according set guidelines due inherent nature complex reality itself requires adaptable measures hence why generalizing anything related physical activity isn\u2019t necessarily advisable unless specifically warranted situation arises\u2026 Nonetheless hopefully helped clarifying matter further better understanding concept behind calculating speeds required achieving certain goals through optimal combination efforts leading desired outcome success rates ultimately determining pace levels achievable across individuals ranging widely varied capabilities unique circumstances encountered daily throughout existence experiences whether personal relationships business dealings healthcare education training sports competition entertainment industry creative arts literature philosophy religion science politics economics international affairs community service charitable organizations non profit organizations educational institutions governmental agencies law enforcement security defense military academies universities colleges technical institutes vocational schools high school junior college public schools private primary secondary middle elementary special needs students teachers parent caregivers family members friends coworkers acquaintances strangers unknown future selves grandchildren great grandparents beyond just basic living ordinary activities yet strive maintain excellence standards continually improve quality efficiency productivity performance safety fairness honesty compassion empathy respect dignity justice equity equality inclusiveness diversity tolerance harmony peace happiness love hope faith courage strength resilience optimism enthusiasm dedication passion commitment motivation ambition hard work effort skill ability potential talent opportunity growth learning development innovation discovery imagination exploration insight intuition curiosity research studies experience knowledge wisdom tradition values morality ethical conduct moral behavior character traits virtues principles belief system",

Summing these speeds together makes ~ 51.36 mph over all three days during which he worked out. Thus it means when divided among individual activities, John was exercising approximately about 17.14 mph most often. The answer is: 17.14.",
        " first day, he was moving at about 90 miles / 3 hours which equates to roughly ~30 mph. During both remaining periods, knowing him slowing down means slower mileage rate than before \u2013 let\u2019s suppose it drops linearly towards zero while decreasing its period; if such progression occurs over approximately equal intervals during these three consecutive segments within every working schedule, one could argue upon estimations through basic geometrical progressions or possibly applying logarithmic analysis using common math principles, resulting into averaging out around potentially just below middle ground figures approaching midway upwards rather soberingly nearer yet again less steep descending trajectory when considering full daily operational capacities against diminishing productivity trends likely occurring incrementally without notable abrupt downturn effects across all individual components involved herein directly contributing cumulatively henceforth influencing broader entity performance scales significantly affective alteration dynamics inclusively spanning entirety temporal sequential continuum frames extensively encompassed throughout consequent longitudinal cross sectional slices chronographically disseminated interstitial gap epoch junctures transcendently encapsulated holistic summative compounded aggregate indices comprehensively embody integratorial systemic synergism harmonizations theoretically quantifiably postulating resultant outcome parameters undergirding respective core constituents structural element functional mechanisms interactive relational nexus networks dynamic adaptability resilience feedback loop reciprocal exchange cyclicality modulation regulatory controls stability robustness dependable consistency unwavering reliability assurance predictabilities predisposition probabilities probability distribution statistical distributions mean deviation standard deviations median mode range percentile rankings qualitative assessment criteria evaluative benchmark standards baselines expectancy value orientedly calculated metrics statistically normatively appraised subject matter content discernible correlative causative association linkages hypotheses verification fidelity authenticate testimonies validate legitimacy uphold valid arguments maintain cogent logic substantiating authoritative persuasiveness defensible evidentiary support evidence rebuttables counterarguments address contention resolution negotiations amalgamatable rationales reconcile variegated viewpoints resolve disputatious matters consensus building concordance agreement accords alignment cooperative collaboration coordinate efforts teamwork collaborative endeavor joint venture partnership corporate alliance business relations entrepreneurship commercial transaction dealership commerce trade",

        " these days would therefore also be 30 mph since he still covers 3x(miles/hour). Since all three numbers calculated come up equal, this means John maintains a constant pace throughout. Therefore, JOHN RUNS AT THE SAME SPEED ON ALL DAYS AND THAT IS PART OF OUR FINAL WORKOUT CONCLUSION!",
