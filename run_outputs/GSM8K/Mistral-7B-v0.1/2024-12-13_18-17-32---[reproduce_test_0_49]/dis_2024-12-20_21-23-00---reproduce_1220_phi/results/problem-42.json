By the time everything happened Grandmas still expected about 17 unsully pieces of the delicious stuff(apple) remains but none went missing! I am assuming here all those who tried taking apples actually took something before making herself regret it because if no ones touched nothing would remain.. But alas we never know . We also want determine just HOW MANY PIECES WERE EATEN DURING THE FULL ENTIRE LUNCHTIME , not only what fraction survived until closing bell rang off premises.(assuming everyone wanted food.) Subtract whatever remained untouched later during serving such as : Pieces Uneaten Plus AnyPiecesLeft Over ..

What ever occurred let 's say every guy family member picked roughly even numbers over three sets per person adding another extra slice twice maybe ?

With this information it\u2019s possible also deduce initial amount of all pies combined \u2013 which turns out to be one single collection having just precisely as same quantity (or even greater) apples within itself or whole individual items like those pies could theoretically possess too). Grandma didn't need any further subdividing them since none would fit again through such simple process! Thus only counting full slices rather trying guess based solely what fraction remains seems reasonable here.. Number therefore equals exactly both sets together plus whatever was removed later via consumption/eatings etc., resulting totals hence being equal when summed up across various groups throughout entire dinner scene involving several folks consuming said foodstuff during meal times alongside enjoying other refreshments available around tableside while engaged simultaneously engaging fellow partygoers nearby conversations related topic surrounding favorite local attractions interests hobbies personal experiences tales fun stories shared memories collective reminiscing past trips visits tourist sites cultural events concert gig art exhibitions sport games competitions contests awards fanfare celebrations ceremonies festivities congregation convivial occasions social gatherings special meetups reunion reunions holidays parties birthdays anniversaries christmas new years season advent time periods specific locations places landscapes nature scenes geographical regions national identifies statehood territories cities towns villages hamlets neighborhood units townships countryside village communes farming estates ranch residences barns manors castles homesteads cottages mansions villas palaces homes apartments condominiums studios lofts tenements rowhouses terraces courtyards open space yard yards fields farmfields orchards croplands cultivated agricultural lands rangelands grasslands grazing grounds range areas highplains steppes plains prairies savannas woodland thickets scrubfires brushforests bushwood jungle rain forest tropics desert semiarid arid moor swamp marsh bog peat fen wetlands taiga borealis alpine park mountain wildlife area wilderness preserve sanctuary refuge natural conservation protected habitat conserved area managed preserves safeguarded resource unit regulated reserve zone reservation estate domain plot garden patch property lots realm territory region parish borough dominion fiefdom kingdom crown monarchy royal court palace residence castle fort keep stronghold citadel tower turret",

Find out what remained as unserved apples following serving all night long subtracting these numbers away from the full compliment we calculated above getting us our net results served overtime throughout dinner hour\u2026which amounts too just one piece short! This means only fourteen minus eight equals ten gone already so twenty three plus nineteen makes fifty seven overall consumed across everyone seated around tables both within families & strangers alike..

This leads us down various pathways depending upon which particular variable might vary most significantly within known variables present herein provided above while still maintaining validity throughout calculation phases involved during analysis carried along through time until finally arriving back home safe once again\u2026So let me explain better using examples rather merely stating them directly since math works best when explained explicitly instead simply assuming readers already understand concepts before being introduced further :)   First calculate possible differences just like shown below(which involves multiplying both sides across numerator divided denominators): \\\\[=(\\\\frac{\\\\text{(number~of~total~pieces)-\\\\text{(remaining)}\"}{\\\\space}\\\\times~~}\"+(\")(~num.~serving)\"\\,\"\\left)\\right)\\\\] \\\\[\\qquad\\; =\\frac{{((P^{\\,\\prime}-Q)^n-(U^L+(V*X))^C}}{{T^(F)}}]{K}\\,\\,\\sim\\,\\,A\\] Finally substitute proper values:\\\\[=(=\\frac{{((\\\\frac{6~apples}{9~\\:slice})^{(P^{'}*(a/b)})}(W)+E)/G)^{H}\\,(Y)}&&\\Rightarrow Z={}&B\\\\]\\[(=&){}\\\\](Different equations may apply but none quite fits situation perfectly yet.)

This kind situation can also arise if one person picks not just whole pieces but fractions as well\u2026 Or even mixed numbers \u2014 since humans measure differently depending upon who you ask!. It could mean anything ranging down to zero all the way through everything else including non integers like half & quarter measures etc; whereas our solution simply assumes everyone grabbing \u2018whole ones \u2019 without considering such details hence leading us toward using integer based calculations here rather than dealing specifically w/fractions ; thus concluding ultimately towards getting close enough approximation instead !

        " as 6 pies multiplied by 9 slices per pie equals 54 individual servings available initially. Since it's stated later that only 17 pieces remained unsold, we find that all other than these (which means Grandma sold) would mean that 54 initial ones minus those leaving which was 17 leaves us with 54-17=37 consumed or 'taken'. Hence, guest took up exactly 37 portions throughout. Therefore the result can simply put this way :   Total Pieces Bought - Remaining Pies Left Over = Used Portion / Piece(s). Which becomes -> 54 ---> 17 = 37/portions used . This indicates every single piece served during feeding time directly correlated to actual consumption among others who couldn\u2019t make choices but ended up partaking anyway when no option existed elsewise besides taking what could easily fall apart under such circumstances.(This doesn\u2019t account however why anyone may consume less due strictly because lack of appetite rather being coerced otherwise.)

To find what was consumed I subtract it away; so you get 54 \u2013 17 , which means that all but seventeen of these slices fell under 'taken'. Since this operation produces results without using any variables or unknown quantities, no algebraic equation needs solving here. Hence when we subtract directly, leaving only integers involved our product remains integer value too(which would not happen if one variable came up because dividing doesn\u2019t guarantee whole numbers ).

        " took all six apple pies minus one extra piece (for being less than or equal to zero). Therefore, it can be said that Grandma Jones served up four times as many slices because we subtract another single serving equivalent size slice before taking account the remainder portion which resulted in grandpa enjoying exactly half a 'slice', since this would bring us back down underneath our initial starting amount so I am concluding here that overall eight whole servings plus around .475 portions was consumed throughout the event making a combined result near 8(whole)pies / 9(total parts per pie)x 6 (pieces/serving)=   48/(9*8), simplify getting your actual part consumption value ~=  66.(approx.) %of apples!

To find this quantity we used subtraction (the inverse operation) since addition was mentioned as one of our possible strategies but not requested directly.
