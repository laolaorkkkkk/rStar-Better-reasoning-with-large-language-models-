Then find half of Raymond's jewels in terms of Aaron's jewels. Since it says like this 3 less than Aaron's Weight, so we need to add and subtract from Aaron's Weight also. If we can just solve for AaronWeight first, then we know rate of half rays weight. rate half rays weight is half AaronWeight minus 3 = AaronWeight plus 10/2. rate half AaronWeight is 3. AaronWeight is rate * 10. From here: half AaronWeight times 2 is AaronWeight. AaronWeight is rate * 10. Then half Aaron Weight is rate + 3. Then_rate + 3 is half Aaron weight, now we know 3 more than AaronWeight is all that's matter. So Aaron_weight is (rate + 3 + r) * 2. Then multiply both sides of equation by 2. Then multiply entire equation by half. half AaronWeight is equal to half ofRate plus 3 plus Rate. Simplify and we'll find the weightrate. AaronWeight is equal to twice Rate plus 6. Divide the top side by 2. Then divide bottom side by 2. Then we have half Andrew's Weight equal to Andrew's weight plus 3. This is very hard, better use simple division instead. rate equal to weight -3. divide another equation by rate-3. Last we get AaronWeight equal to AndrewWeight times rate. But sincerate is equal to weight-3 not Weight equalAndrew Weight. Then Andrew equals Andrew weight plus rate. Then divide back equation byRate+3. Get Rate weight equal to Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3. Then Andrew weight equal Andrew weight plus rate. Finally Andrew Weight = Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3= Andrew weight=2 Andrew weight plus Andrew weight equals 2 Andrew Weight plus Andrew weight-3 equals 2 Andrew weight plus Andrew weight equals Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3 = Andrew weight= Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3= Andrew weight= Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3= Andrew weight= Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3= Andrew weight equal Andrew weight plus Andrew weight-3.
