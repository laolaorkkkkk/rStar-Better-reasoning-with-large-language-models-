The temperature of the candle, as it burns, follows: $T(t) = T_0 - 2t$, where $T_0$ is the initial temperature of the candle (i.e., length before burning). We need to solve for $t$ when $T(t)$ is less than or equal to the height limit of 6 cm. This becomes $23 - 2t \\leq 6$. Solving this inequality, we find that the candle will burn for more than 8 hours. Since we only consider up to 5:00 PM, our solution is correct within the hour span we are considering here. Thus, if we only consider the burned duration up to 5:00 PM, the height of the candle left would be $23 - 2 \\times 4 = 23 - 8 = 15$ cm at 5:00 PM.",
