Next, identify the distance traveled from the second stop onwards until he arrived at the finish line. He finished his 60-mile bike trip. Since the last stop was 15 miles from the finish, he must have remained another 15 miles on his final stretch of the trip. Therefore, he remained at that point for the last 15 miles of his trip. This implies that he covered (60 - 15) = 45 miles between his first and second stops in addition to the initial section before the first stop as well. Hence he also needed to add the 20 miles he had already covered before reaching the first stop. Thus, the remaining time he would spend is the final stretch of only 5 miles which means he was off by the following calculation: \\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \\] but this is incorrect because he was off by 15 miles so it follows that our final calculation would be\\[ 45 - 15 = 30\\]. The difference here may imply his error was only the final stretch. Thus we need to calculate the correct final stretch by adding all possible sections like 15+20+x=45 15+20=35 thus making 45-25=20+15=35-15=20. final difference should be calculated thus as below as such 45-20=25 25-15=10 thus answer should be rechecked back in context of actual problem only as correct calculation needs. correct final is\\[45-20=25-15=10.\\] Thus the answer is 20-15=5.
