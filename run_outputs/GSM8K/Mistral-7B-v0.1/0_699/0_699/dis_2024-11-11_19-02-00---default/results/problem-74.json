Hence finally answering your query... if ARTIE SPENT NO MONEY TOPURCHASE ANY OF THIS SEE HOW HE MADE PROFIT TODAY SHE WOULD EARN \"$86\" AND THE QUESTION CAN NOT BE ANSWED WITH NUMBER DATA OFF DISCUSSION SO IN CONCLUSION MY FINAL YEAR IS $$86 !!! :) I AM GLAD I COULD ALSO DEVISE ONES BETTER FOR UP NEXT PARTIES ;) AS U SAID :)..
