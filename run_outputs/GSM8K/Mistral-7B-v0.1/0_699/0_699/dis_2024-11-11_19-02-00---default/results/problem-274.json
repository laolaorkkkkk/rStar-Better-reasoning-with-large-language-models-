Similarly, adding together ($30/packet)*(number of packets), it becomes clear that (($30*x)) can also represent any unknown quantity we might wish; using this equation one could replace 'x', representing our variable expression such as time or distance related quantities without affecting its truthfulness overall due to multiplication being commutative i.e., reversible order won\u2019t affect outcome. Finally dividing both sides equally amongst them gets us back again what needs division among groups namely those whose interest lies within fields like mathematics but not strictly confined beyond just numbers alone because mathematical principles apply universally regardless whether someone deals specifically only numerical data instead other non arithmetic concepts outside merely calculations dealing primarily solely via figures!
