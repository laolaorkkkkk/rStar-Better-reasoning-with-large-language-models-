        " + 60. Condition 2 tells us that Kassidy has 3/4 (three fourth) times what Aurelia has; or equivalently, using our definitions above, it means that when compared against the known value ($), this results in another definition which says K = (.75)$A$ since .75x4=3 but I only need one side here, not both sides multiplied through. Putting those equations all over once again shows these values :    $$   $ =     $$   $.      This set makes sense mathematically speaking because adding the first equation into itself twice yields         $$K+A =$$ $$\\qquad =\\quad\\;\\,\\,\\, +\\ \\tfrac{3}{4}\\, \\$        $$\\therefore{}           $$R=\\frac{7}{4}\\,\\$, \\,or\\,\\$ &\\,$\\,${:}$\\\\[\\tfrac{(^4_3)\\,  }{}\\!\\tfrac{\\!(\\sqrt[ ])\\!(.})$$ \\\\]\\iff\\\\ [\\frac{((k+\\tfrac{.75}{\\delta})+a)}{(b+\\tfrac{.75}{\\delta})} \\\\]Now plugging $\\, b=\\dfrac{d}{d}$, also rewritten numerically according to its relationship ($\\tfrac{qr}{(p+c)}$):       ---          Q&E:\\\\[\\begin{align*}\\\\&\\tfrac{7\\, k } {2.5}= \\\\[-8pt] &\\times\\;\\left (\\tfrac{-h^{\\prime}}{e}+f^{-\\prime}-i^{-'} \\right ) \\end{align*}](https://tex.stackexchange.com/help/.php)This leads me back around full circle, like before finding myself having used different approaches toward solving essentially identical problems -- meaning either way could work depending upon whether you consider working independently rather sequentially / systematically... Or even just making up something new without reference points yet still getting right answers :) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~              ----                Certainly possible ;-) But may want eventually focus less attention towards specific aspects related directly unto computation technique choice though sometimes simpler alternative formulations such methods tend appealing particularly regarding clarity within explanation process involved thereby enhancing comprehension overall..
