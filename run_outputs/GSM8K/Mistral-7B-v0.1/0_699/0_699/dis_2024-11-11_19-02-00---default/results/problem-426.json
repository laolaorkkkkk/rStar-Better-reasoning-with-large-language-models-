        " bagel. To find out how expensive the soup was, first calculate what amount constitutes a 25% increase over the base value (the bagel). This can simply equate to taking one quarter ($1) off every four units; thus increasing the unit count becomes evident when we divide 4 into 25 resulting in three whole lots plus remainder parts equaling seven fourths or 1\u00bc times as large per dollar worth portion. Add this markup percentage onto our initial figure--adding together both halves before multiplying against their respective values results easily because fractions translate readily via arithmetic operations like division & multiplication through properties similar those found within algebraic expressions such expression manipulation tools involving cross product rules which essentially combine terms across numerators using factors shared amongst them accordingly making use simplification techniques available due having equivalent quantities whose components share common ground while retaining all necessary information retained throughout process steps despite seemingly complex calculations made simpler once reduced down appropriately thereby eliminating repetitive work saving time whilst providing accurate outcome eventually leading us closer towards solution .

Hence let\u2019s consider what could possibly add up those additional charges:(for example): Suppose Mr Kushal wanted all three items together without spending any extra amount ($x); therefore:- We know Bagel Price=$4--> Soup Cost=BagelCost*PercentageExtra=(1+25/100)*$4=>($1*$4)=$5-(this represents both types being present but no explicit mention made about adding anything else)- Cake Cost=Half Of Bakery Pricing$(bakeryPrice /2) i.e.,~$2Now combine them altogether!

Secondly according to this text Alejandras order consisted out of four different food products Bagel_Cost=$4; Soup=(bagel)+(25/100*price(bagel)) ; Cake=(1/2)*(price(bagel)). To find those calculations you can take following steps:-First convert percentage into fractional values (divide it by 100)-Second multiply found fractions multiplied to original base (before converting) value so we get needed additions (++ or -= sign) depending if calculated addition results exceeding starting point (-), lowering below origin ((value-(percentage)/100); third one just perform multiplication based division operation (*)(operation applied above all numbers involved but not result yet):   Soup Cost :    Price Before Percent Conversion+(Percent / % )*(base)->$4+(25/(100*base)), here its $(4+\\frac{25}{100})->($4+$(.\\xB0\\rD)=$, using calculator , Fraction -> Decimal,$(\\fraction{25} { \\colorbox{",

This means if one unit (representing dollar) increases its value by $.25 ($=.25), it goes up by twentyfive percent (.25). Therefore; since one unit multiplies another unit, multiply both numbers together like so: $+(.25x$)=Price. Thus \\$=Cost/Amount(percent increase)$/.
