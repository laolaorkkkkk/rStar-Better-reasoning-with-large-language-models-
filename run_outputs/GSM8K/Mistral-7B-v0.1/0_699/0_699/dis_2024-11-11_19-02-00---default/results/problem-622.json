Subtract these numbers from the starting amount. That leaves him with 20 original - 5 consumed equals 15 left but wait! He still needs to account for what happens next too because as stated within the question 'he gives away half.' This means whatever remains gets halved once again according to instruction. Half of those remaininigs or rather about 15/2 equaling approximately round(7.5) equalling 7 (when rounded off since no decimal representation exists for individual countable objects such as units of candies here), considering usual interpretation rules applied towards natural data types like integers dealing with discrete counts under normal human observation constraints usually implies using full unit integer value unless explicitly mentioned otherwise i.e., not fractions etc.). Therefore, based on above steps & logic application combined , our calculated remainder stands corrected back to single int type whole figure equivalent close approximation being around ceil[floor((number_remaining)/num_donor_receivers)-1]=ceil[(15/2)]=round(7.5)=approx.(roundedup)->7 .

So James gets three sticks away leaving him sixteen minus those eight ,two forty divided again results another couple plus seven but if adding fractions makes them larger than original amount its impossible since fraction goes down.(dividend smaller than divisor)= negative values cannot apply here .
