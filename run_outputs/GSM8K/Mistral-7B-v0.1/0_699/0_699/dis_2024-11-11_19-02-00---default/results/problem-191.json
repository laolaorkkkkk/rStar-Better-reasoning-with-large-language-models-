        " ducks (10) times their amount needed; three point five (10*3.5). This equals thirty five. Divide this value into seven equal parts because these values reflect one full week not just daily requirements(divide 35 / 7 ). Three points eight six sevenths represents what was consumed through every single day within those same period (three dot .six sevenths), which translates as about four fifths (.6 approx )of a pound depending upon rounding rules applied.) Consequently , all birds require approximately .6 lb/day if we break down consumption over time while maintaining proper nutrition.(Each bird needs roughly 0.35lbs./week so it would still come out around average since even dividing across multiple meals may vary slightly but overall remains very close together.) We can conclude that ducks consume food resources equivalent near or less than half kilogram per diem considering such feeders usually store grain rather providing exact quantities via direct measurements etc.).

This means each bird requires about eighteen half dozen (.18X6=~1); so combined these adders consume almost twice themselves every twelve hours!. To determine daily rates take our previous calculation above but divide those results again by six rather than subtracting another quarter hour off!

But since this question wants us specifically working within weeks not years let\u2019s just use our simple formula as follows : To get consumptions values here consider 'x', denote wkds or daily intakes hence ; X*d/wk=WKg(where W stands weight; k represents kilograms conversion factor).

        " condition: One week has seven days which means we divide (35 / 7) to find daily requirement among them. Dividing equates us to roughly  5 pounds/day among all 10 birds. As such one bird consumes about .5 pound or half weight every single morning when dividing it into equal portions over those fourteen mornings through this period. This can serve as good information if you\u2019re wondering how often feedings might occur throughout these times spent together within their natural habitat but considerations like time availability could also play significant roles here since not everyone may want access during prime periods due sole variety reasons!

        " every week. Since we want daily amounts it makes sense first find out what one duck requires monthly if needed (multiplying weeks). Assuming four weeks make up a month; so multiplied becomes  3.5x4 which equals about 14 . However since no time frame was mentioned let\u2019 s consider this data as applicable only within single or multiple but equal periods such ,like 'daily'. Next calculate exactly required quantity based upon these known parameters :    Total weight requirements / Number of Ducks      Where \u2018total requirement \u2019 signifies total amou nt available throughout specified intervals(week/month)for all members ('ducks')to obtain necessary sustenance ; here being referred through feeding theminsects respectively.\u2019This denotes summationof individual requisitesacross entire group under same conditions over periodstill remaining uniform i.e constant & independent concerning varying timespans likedaysorweeks.'

        " one duck consumes per week (pounds) by the population size to identify the group's consumption rate over this period as well. Since we want the daily requirement instead of the weekly allowance provided above; divide both sides of equation 'number*amount/7=daily intake,' substituting relevant quantities into our new version of it like so 'total_intake = quantity/days.' Calculate their combined food requirements according to these instructions. We know every duck requires three point five pounds (3.5), therefore all together twenty ducks demand seventeen poundes(twenty times thirty point five). Therefore when divided evenly throughout seven successively placed units within which time passes ('days'), those numbers become approximately equal to .
