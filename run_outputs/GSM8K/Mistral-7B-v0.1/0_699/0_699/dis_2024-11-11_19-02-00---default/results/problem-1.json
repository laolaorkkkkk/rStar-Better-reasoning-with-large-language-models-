Since every bolt contains multiple lengths/feet etc., comparing quantities would mean just looking into their relative sizes not counting actual numbers(length units). Half of something usually implies dividing them equally among groups but here its related directly proportionality so even though words suggest smaller quantity due numerical comparison becomes untrue because when halved while keeping proportion constant still results same overall size which doesn\u2018t make sense mathematically speaking!
