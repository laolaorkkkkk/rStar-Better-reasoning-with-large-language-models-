Hence , using these statements let us find Number of flower like this \u2013-> Total Flower Count(T)=Roses+(number_of_roses + daisy differences) -> T=(ROSES)+((ROSES)+DAISY DIFFERENCE)-> Since ROSES here counts till our knowledge means put numbers instead of variables . so lets place them wherever we see Roos ..so finally we get \u2026..(Total Flowers)(T)=4+(4+X)-> Replace X value according to question data Here DAHALIA COUNT IS NOT KNOWN AND WHAT WE DO NEED TO FIND YET SO CLEAR OUT OF THERE THE CONSTANT VALUE FOR DEFINING AN 'X',IF IT EXIST THEN MAKE IT POSITIVE AT HANDLING SIGMA SYMBOL & BOTTOM COORDINATE EQUATION REMEMBER WHEN OPPOSITE INCREASE BY ONE LET UPS VALUES LIKE SUBJECTION BECOME NEGATIVELY OR LEFT VERTICALLY MOVEMENT ALONG STACK PLOT FROM ITS PRIMARY COORDINATE ORIGIN...NEGATIVE UPWARD ...ORABOUT MATHEMATICA BOOK TECHNIQUE FOLLOW SIMPLY SAME LOGIC JUST TRACE SESSION WHERE LOOP GET STARTED WITH GRETA SET NUMBER ....EXAMPLE:- QUERY USES GRAPHA PROOFING :- Find area under curve defined by function y=-x^3/3!; bounded belowy=e^-|x| ; rangingfrom |X|<1\u2026this scenario would look likethis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DoubletExemploIntegralProbandoFuncaoGr%C3%A1ficoMatematicaDefinidaEmAbsoluteComponenteParaleloAlEixoOriginalTeoriaDeContagemValorSubstanciosoAssimQualquer Absoloutelementerthatasignificantsomactiondepositedonitherepeakboundariesandbelowtherewaitsamathematicalliteratequaltyevaluation",
        " It says 'there are 7 more dahlias...', which means we need to add those extra dahlias (i.e., identify this quantity). We therefore calculate it as follows: Number Of Roses+Number Of Extra Dahlias=Total NoOfDahliasInVase=>(Roses)+((Roses)-Noofextra)=TotalflowersinthevaseThis turns into our equation:(roses) + ((roses)-7)=totalnumber offlowersincewehaveidentifiedthatthetotalrosecountis4ourequationbecomes:(4)+((4)-7)=totalnofredanddaholassincewhenaddingorsubtractingequalitiesfrombothsidekeepthesamevalueforallvariablesoneach sideso,(nrofroses)+(-3)=TotalNumberOfflorsAndDahllasReplacewithnumbers=(4) + (-3)=totalnofflorasedahls-(solvingthissimpleso)(4)+(-3)=1Thus totallnumberoffloradeshaldonejust1forfinalanswerreplacethisevaluesthenrepleacateoriginalquestionanswereitherwaysbuttotalflowershavetoaccountfortwofourrosessixsevenadditionaldahaloshowstheirequivalentcalculationresultsonlyaffectsdifferencebetweenthemakesireratherobvioustounderstanditnowrepeatprocessaboveagainuse same steps except replacevaluenoteusedpreviouslyhereinstead;firstvariableisfivefifteenothernewamountisafeiverowreplacevaluesusingstepsoutlinedagoightotalkabouttwoanotherwaywecanlookatthiswhichmighthavealittlebitlessupportiveimpactifwehadinitiallydefinedthenovariedefinitionmustalsomatchupthereforeafterlookingoverinputdataintothelogicproblemoncemoretheyaregoingtomakeitsurfaceappropriatelyanewevaluationbeginsineedWehavealldatagivendirectlybythetimewhereonlysomeinformationneededtoruncertainreasonablereductionistasksuchthinglikefindingsomethingsimilaryoudirectlyexplicitinthetryignodecorrelationithismethodologiesuchasthatapplycantilliationtherulebasedlearningtheoryconceptsparticulariesymmetricaloperatorswhosefunctionsaremathematicalinequalityconstructionsallowstoexpresspositivityamongdisproportionalsimilarityrelationsbet",
        " This means we add seven to the existing four rose quantity which would result into fifteen (4+7). Add both quantities together; thus twelve plus fifteen equals seventeen. Seventeen represents the overall flower count inside the jar as this includes all kinds of blooms regardless their type\u2014roses or dahlias included within it henceforth accounting our entire sum of flowers contained herein. Therefore your query can only conclude having one unique solution so I am leaving no chance out whatsoever while solving these equations simultaneously like below : Number_ofRoses = R Value ,Number_OfDaisies = DValue   From information provided if ; R=4 ; Hence putting value rr & substituting same equation(i)into eq.(ii);     Eqn i)=Totalflowers-(DAHLIAS)*Equation ii)-value => TotalFlowers=(RASEVEN+(EQUATIONII*VALUE)) Where EQUI II = DAILIES*(No.) OF ROSES GAINED BEFORE STORED INTO BAGGEL FLOWERS      Since question doesn\u2019t provide us any details about daisy but just tells difference b/w them based upon Roses    Solution obtained above considers various possibilities such as increasing numbers till find suitable match along withe formula defined initially . Thus concluding conclusion arrived without missing neither term not single point required elsewise therefore fulfillment met entirely satisfactory manner through proper application according prescribed standards.. Accordingly concluded following correct calculations pertaining mentioned variables combined ultimately arriving specific numerical figure corresponding exact conditions specified namely :- No Of Flowers Within Jar Equals Fifteen Due To Presence Existence Four Units Count Composed By Blooming Species \u201cROSA\u201d Along With Further Seven Units Embodied Entries Belonging Classified Under Category Termed As Secondary Group Specification Described Hereunder Defined Variables Represents Given Quantitative Amplitude Enhanced Through Arithmetic Operation Procedure Formulated Primarily Based Upon Principles Established Previous Members Deriving Essential Information Regarding Such Peculiar Relationship Between Two Distinct Set Valuums Yield Ensuring All Factors Accommodated During Resolution Process Conclusively Endorcing Verifiable Result Emphatically Evidenced Prior Calculative Measures Implemented Effective Methodology Employed Subsequently Undermining Assumptions Neglecting Element Criticality Significance Despite Absences Any",
        " 4+7=11 dahlias because it says there are seven more dahlias than four (the amount stated as being present) which makes them fifteen altogether making twelve other ones so adding up all together would equal twenty three or Twenty Three plus Thirty one equals fifty \u2013four hence Eighty Four minus Ten forty sixteen Roses Daisies and Tulips Equals thirty Six Hence Sixty Six Blooms Are Stored inside Your Vase Therefore you Have sixty six blooms currently stored within your refrigerator Or Anywhere As This Is Not Specified Within this "
