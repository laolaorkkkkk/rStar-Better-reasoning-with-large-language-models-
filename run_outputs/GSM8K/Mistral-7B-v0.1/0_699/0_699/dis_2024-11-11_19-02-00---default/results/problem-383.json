However we note here , only sixteen cups could possibly come out through those three batches since each pint yields twelve servings hence rendering thirty-two possible sales altogether which leads to netting up thrice as fast compared with the original scenario assuming zero losses due to spoilage or suchlike events during operation tenures meaning essentially revenue increases accordingly so let\u2019s just keep things simple right ?

Since it takes time (let's say T hours) to sell all three batches, her revenue would decrease over those hours since only part gets sold per hour. Over one entire set sale cycle (T*X), we can compute this as [(total_cups/average sales rate)*revenue per unit]. Solving equation X=T*$0.8 results into about T=$0.75 or every 7 minutes spent equals roughly ($12/$4)=$3 made until fully depleted based on average volume consumed per opened duration assuming steady demand throughout available supply life span [inherently simplifying non-static real world complexities here]..
