Among these individuals (people living within said geographic location) we understandably consider them adults when referring so since generally it excludes minors like infants or teenagers which aren\u2019t considered capable citizens due to age limitations placed upon such persons. However despite being called 'children', young ones still fall under general term \u2018minority.\u2019 As mentioned earlier no further classifications differentiate any single individual but merely groups according what may seem societal normative standards based off demographics available through census data etc.; therefore let us use same wording henceforth \u2013 simply call everyone regardless whether childhood stage ends prior maturation process ending officially recognized status achieved amongst one\u2019s peers thus making him/her entitled full citizen rights accord unto self via laws governing human civil codes applicable worldwide irrespective ethnic backgrounds including race itself\u2014meanwhile retain original concept intended here meaningfully described above namely only counting those fitting description referred previously except possibly included also perhaps accidentally misclassified cases not categorized correctly owing oversight errors while compiling respective information otherwise accurately accounted per statistic reporting methods utilised thereby causing discrepancies arising out mistakenly attributed labels applied erroneously during examining dataset collected over numerous years leading researcher determination about present trend exhibited visually evident changes recorded historically document review indicating patterns changing constantly occurrences shifting slightly every passing decade subsequently impact directly affect outcome derived conclusions reached analyst ultimately summarizing various factors influencing current situation evaluated collectively together yield insightful insights regarding prevailing issues confront faced challenges identified existing problems require immediate attention resolved swift manner ensuring continuous improvement maintained stability long lasting benefits accrued sustainable growth enhancing livelihood security enhances quality lives enjoyed community members supporting their mutual goals striving forward working cohesively achieving success shared prosperous future generations inherit legacy established strong foundational principles core values upheld commitment dedication demonstrated efforts toward accomplishments sought achievement pursued hard won victories celebrated across boundaries uniting diverse cultures embracing multiculturalism advocate harmony peace promoting global unity seeking common ground finding consensus reaching decisions taking care stewardship earth providing resources natural habitat protect preserving wildlife safeguarding biodiversity maintain balance environmental wellbeing nurturing healthy planet respect reverence honor responsibility caring compassion empathy understanding tolerance accept",

Next identify females; this yields another subtraction operation (Total Population \u2013 Females) which equals 23786\u2013 9092 or 14694 individuals remaining as either child or female citizen because we\u2019ve already accounted both male and female populations. This result implies that all residents other than adult citizens (men & women), comprising of minors hence classified 'children', add upto these figures namely: Children= Total Residents not being Men/Women => Number_of Children==Children[All Minors]=Residents['all']-(Men+Females)=14694 Childhood group size Calculate amount per category based off gender disparity details available thus far Mentions indicate equal proportion distributions amongst genders resulting into Women : Men ratio:: 9092:8417 Dividing previous figure(Numerically i.e., \u2018subtractive difference yield\u2019) among Two groups would offer further insight regarding distribution pattern via ratios like\u2026 Ratio=[Number of Persons|not categorized]/(Sum_Gender Distribution)+Citizens aged=> Gap%~\u2248 [Value]/Population=(14694)/(23786)-Percentage value To conclude calculation process..
