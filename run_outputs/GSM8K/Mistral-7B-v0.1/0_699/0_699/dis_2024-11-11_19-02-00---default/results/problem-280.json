Next identify the other items sold during shopping trip mentioned before along with their corresponding quantities. An additional item identified as four barriga consisted of eight cones priced equally across them so multiplying together yields twenty cents:$0.25x4=$1 again adding both product purchase values results into sixteen bucks being paid altogether.$5+$1=${6} What shows or can show information about temperature change over time period based only upon knowledge contained within document below?

Addition may not be necessary here because this type of mathematical reasoning problems typically don't require it as long you accurately perform multiplication.
