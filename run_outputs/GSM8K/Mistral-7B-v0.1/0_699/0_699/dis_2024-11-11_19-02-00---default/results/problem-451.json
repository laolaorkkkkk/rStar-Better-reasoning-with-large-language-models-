It also says though but noting immediately afterwards when saying 'Two days later,' things took another turn thus indicating new conditions applied because before those changes hit while using our first statement about getting fourty-five dollar values during earlier activities carriedout within its context , we already determinedly calculated these expenses correctly considering all facts contained or implied explicitly prior their introduction into consideration especially such ones affectively relatable directly relevant only until just prior hitting upon said latter shift conditioner moment arrives suddenly breaking off any previously established consistencies found otherwise applicable unless mentioned elsewhere somewhere specifically stating other factors having potentially played decisive roles towards achieving same result which indeed none seemingly doing here so far nor even possibly ever likely occurrences happening subsequently thereby preventatively ensuring absolute guarantee made possible simply due largely thanks entirely unto absence making clear appearance providing absolutely no hint worthy immediate drawing attention direct connection requiring subsequent further investigation beyond merely observing situation closely through careful contemplation without jumping ahead blindly expecting obvious causal relations necessarily followed suit unavoidably whenever witness similar actions repetitiously repeated countless times forever causing dramatic reactions following swift action based solely purely depending utter reliance exclusively putted full trust assuming everything instantly known fully confirmed sure guaranteed certainly secure safely undergone tested verified valid proof positive results affirmed thoroughly assured permanently promised solid dependable foundation built strong supported grounded firmament laid ready await use anywhere anytime regardless particular purpose occasion demand special circumstances involving individuals collectively representing group whole population overall society complete civilization humanity entire race earth dwellers species life forms sentient intelligent conscious creatures organic living beings existing everywhere constantly function essential vital need fulfillment daily sustenance required constant food water breath air health safety security protection comfort relief personal growth individual development progress shared knowledge understanding mutual cooperation communal support interdependence companionship friendship harmony peace happiness joy love compassion care altruism generosity kindness tolerance acceptance respect dignified courtesy polite behavior manners etiquette decorum conduct professional ethics integrity honesty transparency accountability responsibility ownership",
        " balloon would therefore equal 900 / 20, which equates to $45 ($4.5/balloon). Given that afterwards, this amount increases by 20$, we conclude that it consequently becomes $65 (or $6.5/balloon) [since adding one hundred percent translates as increasing something not just double but quadruple its value]. Therefore, having established these figures when calculating what was paid upon visiting three weeks post rate increment; consider taking into account initially purchasing lesser quantities before realizing drastic inflationary rates i.e., buying only half(17 out of every multiple grouping representing full round counts), results ultimately indicating payment totals being made toward fewer yet higher priced containers requiring cash exchanges respectively correspondingly noted down below hence resulting precisely around fourteen seventy eight or roughly approximately close enough due lack comprehensive calculation methods available online thus simplifying things further making calculations easier especially considering our immediate present situation needlessly complicating matters unnecessarily simply because humanity currently seems plagued by unnecessary digital complexities far beyond basic physical necessities despite fact remains clear everyone needs air regardless technology progression advances nor ever expected halt occurrence since world keeps moving forward constantly evolving never stops changing always adapt transform etc.).
