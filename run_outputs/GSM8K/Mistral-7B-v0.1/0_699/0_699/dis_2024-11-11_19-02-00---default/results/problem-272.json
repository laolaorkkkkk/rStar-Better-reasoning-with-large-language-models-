Subtraction used again gets us down below zero meaning someone owes something instead! To find exactly who needs reimbursement consider going over every item line one last time starting our calculations using original figures rather than approximate ones since doing otherwise leads us astray towards incorrect answers thus causing confusion hence why I initially stated making sure precision remains intact throughout whole process before reaching conclusion about correctness within provided context .
