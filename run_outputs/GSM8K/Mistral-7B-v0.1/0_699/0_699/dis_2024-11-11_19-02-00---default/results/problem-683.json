We know however this result corresponds to just doing them both separately so calculating all together would require twice as long i.e., double(average_time))= 100. Because we want exactly what happened when Chrissy mixed up 'one unit/half',we divide our earlier computation into equal parts thus getting (100/(number_of_halves))=(100/2).
