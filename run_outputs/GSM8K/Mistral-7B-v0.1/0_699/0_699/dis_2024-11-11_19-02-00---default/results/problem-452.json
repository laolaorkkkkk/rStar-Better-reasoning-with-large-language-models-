This way every group contributes evenly regardless whether something negative happened earlier because if only positive events occurred everything turned good again afterwards too!

It also goes another 30 mph (for one hour), which means adds just three quarters as far \u2014 or simply calculate using your own proportionate relationship skills; 3/5th times less than before would thus mean .60miles per hour(because its halfway down) instead of all six full ones you calculated above.. And since these distances add up over time we get back around twelve mile difference when doing quick math--which doesn\u2019t seem right considering no changes happened inside our little exercise here yet.(So keep going). Remember though because everything else stayed constant while only those numbers changed --this shows us something quite crucial about averages!They aren\u2018T actually determined merely adding values together without accounting varying durations involved.--Instead what matters mostare their relative ratios among them...Thats why even if both parts took place along identical routesand therefore followed similar pathswith equal speeds&distancesbetween stopsbut might differ slightly intimeframesdue various reasonssuchas traffic conditions weather forecasts unavailabilityof suitable stopping pointsetcthere still remains enough flexibilityinsideour understandingsootherspectiveanalyzingsuchlikepythagorassimple equationcould explainwhyaverage rates can varyaccordingtopseudodatapointsintheformulationweusedaboveincalculationstepsdescribedbelowfollowthetutoriallinkstolearnmoreaboutitmathematicallyfromscratchusing pythoncodebelowherehttp://colab.research.google.com/github/japneasy/*Calculator Code Below*```pythonimport numpy.matlibimport pandas ",
        " travels at 30 mph for another hour, which equals 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles. Add these distances together (120 miles + 30 miles) to get a total of 150 miles. Next, add up the time spent driving both speeds (2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours). Divide the total distance driven (150 miles) over the total amount of time taken (3 hours) to calculate the average rate or speed as follows \u2014 (total mileage / total duration )= 150/3 = 50mph",
        " * 1 hour = 30 miles. Combine these distances together; therefore, the overall journey covers (120 miles + 30 miles) = 150 miles. To find its average speed over all three legs, divide the entirety (total distance covered=150 miles) by time spent driving(which equaled 2+1 =3hr). Therefore, we get 150miles / 3hours ===> An approximate resultant would equal approximately about 50 MPM or Miles Per Hour as the average moving velocity across both segments combined per unit 'hour'. Thus, the correct choice among those mentioned earlier regarding our scenario translates into Option C exactly which states \u2018It\u2019s not D.\u2019 Hence if we refer back directly onto your alternatives presented initially \u2013 none correspond precisely likewise what we inferred through out computational steps herein detailed thusly leading us toward selecting option B : It doesn\u2019t match any listed options above accurately enough..!

To find out what you get if we divide 150 by three, simply take your calculator or count using fingers until reaching fifteen hundred, placing them down every third hand; doing such results into fifty!
