Additionally, it was stated that half as many cars exited than when compared earlier which implies only about y= 2*number_of_cars leaving initially took an off ramp or route outside the road/traffic. Since no direct numbers can determine 'y,' let\u2019s go forward without accounting for 'y.'

That would mean adding back those 5 cars who managed not to contribute towards congestion via their early departures; i.e., subtracting these out instead (since 'driven away', or contributed). Therefore, we get 30 (total initially) plus 5 equals 35 cars. Secondly, applying what was previously determined regarding only counting during entry into mainstream traffic lanes (the initial count), minus the amount which cleared prior to our specified start point implies just calculating overexertions/intrusions beyond stated time frame resulting purely within said period being considered... Thus ultimately yielding something like this expression involving unknown variables representing specific moments when particular car movements occurred \u2013 namely driving past stationary ones while navigated around slower sections ahead!
