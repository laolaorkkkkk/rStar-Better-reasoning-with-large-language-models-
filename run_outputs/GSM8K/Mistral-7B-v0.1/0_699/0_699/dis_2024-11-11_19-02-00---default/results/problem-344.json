Finally, we compare this price difference ($11) against the previous mentioned amount spent on Juice Box B ((($11-$9)=$2)). Hence, Juice box C costs $2 or so expensive as compared to Juice Box B according our calculations. However, since the instruction asks 'how much more', based only on these values without adjusting either juices prices; comparing them directly could lead us into a misconception. Comparing both actual items instead yields '$11' as stated before. When evaluated within their contextual sense though i.e considering one extra condition ('more'), any direct comparison leads logically towards being incorrect because neither amounts reflect upon differences but rather sum totals respectively referring toward themselves per respective conditions applied above.

This yields us another expression representing this new higher constraint set thus generating our own hypothetical definition outside established rule parameters but only using already provided information contained within question itself without resorting to creating extra unnecessary variables/data sets unless absolutely needed). Simply put though simply stated yet complex enough even beginners understand easily what happens when asked such type queries so well intended explanations usually confuse rather enlighten due over thinking hence not always necessary particularly if your intentions remain straight forward simple direct comprehension based approach helps avoid potential misinterpretation stemming primarily because ambiguity causes confusion especially during assessment phase considering context specific situations often arise requiring immediate action decisions made promptly otherwise delayed responses leading detrimental consequences negatively impact outcomes quality performance evaluation measures accuracy judgment precision discernment ultimately rendering accurate conclusive results impossible attainability thereby necessitating careful consideration diligence attention detail methodology meticulousness thorough analysis exhaustive investigation complete verification cross validation independent review etc!

Again considering only those prices we know about until this moment; according to condition three, JUICE BOX C Is mentioned as being seven dollars over any price point previously listed. Therefore ,it can easily calculated as follows:(C>= Dollars)>>(A+Dollar Seven)$=(4 dollars )+(7 dollar sighn)?=$(4+7$)======$?=$<<4+7=11>>DOLLAR ONE TWELVE .
