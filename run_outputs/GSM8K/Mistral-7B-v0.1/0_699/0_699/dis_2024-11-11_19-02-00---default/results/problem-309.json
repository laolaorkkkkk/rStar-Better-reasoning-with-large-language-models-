Note very important fact : While normal body structures vary slightly among different organisms especially animal species over millions year evolutionary timelines thus showing clear evidence supporting Darwin theory ; however average adult male height tends toward being almost entirely similar everywhere across cultures including same sex twins raised apart suggesting strong influence indeed possibly caused exclusively through environment factors despite underlying vast majority seemingly fixed intrinsic properties determined mostly probably initially already present inside DNA via epigenetic mechanisms .. It means although common belief says everything differs dramatically depending largely upon individual experiences therefore making absolute universal consistency near impossible except maybe physical aspects involving simple muscular strength exertions --even slight changes could theoretically happen quickly relatively often potentially causing massive shifts overall later down life span accordingly until ultimately achieving stability again assuming no drastic external forces occur afterwards such extreme temperatures extremity levels disaster scenarios perhaps leading eventually towards gradual decline ending premature death altogether though hopefully avoiding catastrophic events otherwise outcome likely worse unless significant scientific intervention takes place soonest possible without further delay ??

        " get (15/3) arms which equals 5 arms grown due to being drunk this potion one time. It also grows an extra leg once every five days; therefore a person would acquire ((15)/(5)) legs equaling another additional pair or just 2 as you can only survive using body parts already present naturally. With both growing actions accounted, we conclude the maximum limit imposed upon growth by these elements results into having all possible extremities within human capability plus their augmentations provided through consuming such bizarre liquid formulation\u2014namely six appendages per individual assuming optimal circumstances regarding availability & functionality during transference process!

        " **leg** (not hand) for everyone who gets past the first phase of ingesting this concoction; since growing another body part was required once per five\u00a0days, anyone taking Ingredient X would gain ten legs over their lifetime because ***ninety*** consecutive months or approximately eight years contain twelve twenty-one\u2010month periods/years (*x\u2009=\u20095*).

        " This means we count multiples of 3 up until 15 (the duration): 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 which amounts to five sets within those ten intervals; hence creating arms five times over this period. Therefore, based on these calculations, everyone who consumes the serum would gain four additional legs during their time frame as well since evenly spaced out throughout the remaining ten periods \u2013 specifically at positions seven, eleven and fifteenth \u2013 thereby resulting into growing just under twice the quantity when both conditions concurred coinciding dates .
