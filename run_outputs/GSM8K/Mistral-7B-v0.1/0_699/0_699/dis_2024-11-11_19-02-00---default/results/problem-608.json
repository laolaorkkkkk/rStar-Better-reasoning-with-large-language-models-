With all this info we can calculate how much he spent like so: (Original Price) \u2013 savings rate \u2013 actual payment due = remaining budget/money saved  60-(30%*60)=60-18=$42 because it was original value minus everything calculated; meaning ($). We know both values add together according to equation above as well since $(originalvalue-discount)+$saved=(actualpaymentdue+$remainingbudget/$) . Therefore if you switch them around your result equals what one would expect when substituted into initial formula resulting into same numerical solution.(($-$)(originalvalue))+(savedamount)=(expenditure)+((spentamount)-(-foundinfirstequation))$So our variable amounts becomes : Original Value:$costofoutfitsandclothespurchasedforinitialprice/$pricesthepurchasewascalculatedtobeafteraccountingfortaxonitempricebeforereducingthetotalthereforeweusefindthisvariablebecausethatsolvesourquestion.$Value found earlier without changing variables:(Total spending):$(finalpaidsum)$Spokenresult previously computed using formulas providedabovewhenallvariablesareknownhowverdifferentformatisused:- TotalPaidSum/(Final Paid Sum\u2212Numerator)$$Variable definitions here:[PossessedBudget]:Money available prior to making buying purchases[WhatHappenedBeforeDiscountorTaxes]includestaxincludeditemsizesupplieddatabaseformulausingtotalspentcombinedwithinfoatbeginningsummary&subsequentsubstitutionvaluesfromotherpreviousresultsintoeqationsprovidedwhereas [EndOfDayRemainingResources]:resourcesleftpostpurgecashthroughexchangesystemsoptimizationhintshereapplywhichcanhelpindeterminebestpossibledecisionsbasedupondifferentconstraintstoachievecertaingoalsifdesiredthresholdshavehigherrelativeimportanceovercurrentfocuspointsaccordingtopredefinedobjectivesperhapsonemaywanttoshopjustenoughbutnota$$",
