Firstly, we know that Timothy's locker measures \\( V_{T} \\) cubic inches (\\( V_{T} = 24 \\) cubic inches). Secondly, since Zack's locker is mentioned to be half the size of Timothy's, let's express this mathematically as well. That means if we denote Zack's locker volume as \\( V_{Z} \\), then according to the information provided: \\[ V_{Z} = \\frac{1}{2}V_{T} \\] Substituting our known value of Timothy's locker into the equation above yields:\\[ V_{Z} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\; \\text{cubic inches} = 12 \\; \\text{cubic inches}\\] Now moving forward to finding out about Peter's locker volume; Since its dimension ratio concerning Zack's locker was noted to equal one fourth \u2013 so logically applying mathematical relations, expressed as follows,\\[\\displaystyle {V}_{P} =\\frac {1 }{4}{V}_{Z}\\] Replacing what we just calculated regarding Zack's locker within said expression provides us :\\[\\displaystyle {\\hat{\\boxed{VP}}} = \\frac {1}{\\mathrm {4}}(12 \\, \\mathrm {in} ^3)=3 \\; \\mathbf {in}^3\\] Thus arriving upon definitive measure representation representing Peter's smaller dimensional enclosure quantitatively equivalent to three cubic inches visually aligning proportionately lesser spatial allocation comparing other comparable cases cited previously!",
