        " six-inch sandwiches using this information since their prices depend (three times) on your initial value ($40). Six inches equals one half feet because 6 divided by 12 = .5 (since any amount out of its whole size can always be calculated multiplying by fractions of ten). Therefore three times less expensive means we divide our current price of $40 into third parts which yields about twenty bucks per unit/six inches worth. Calculate another portion needed for four units; multiply thirty dollars by 4 yielding twelve zero dollar bills representing all available funds spent over time due to consumption choices made beforehand regarding purchase decision execution based upon individual preferences or desires resulting ultimately leading consumers towards making decisions involving multiple considerations relating primarily directly related factors including monetary limitations plus personal satisfaction levels expressed individually during transactions occurring regularly amongst human societies worldwide across various cultures throughout history thereby establishing global patterns reflected through collective consumer behavior observed globally thus forming basis underlying framework supporting international commerce standards among nations currently operating within context described above according rules set forth hereunder henceforth known simply referred thereto therefore providing definition used repeatedly when discussing same subject matter below namely defining concept term defined later referring back immediately prior referencing said topic discussed previously but briefly summarizing entire argument presented earlier nonetheless clarifying purpose intended addressed specifically mentioned momentarily whilst analyzing results obtained so far indicating potential trends predicted following along lines suggested already implied initially although nothing stated explicitly yet still implicit somehow indirectly hinted perhaps without intention though subtle meaning conveyed nevertheless suggesting unintentional assumption being drawn implicitly elsewhere besides obvious direct statement merely inferred via language itself albeit clearly communicated otherwise however expressively verbalized whenever possible hopefully ensuring understanding fully comprehensively overall completely satisfying mindfully attentively thoughtful conscientiously carefully deliberately ponderingly judiciously reasonably rationally logically calmly quietly slowly patientily unhurried gently gradually gracefully softly tender lovely elegantly poised well balanced perfectly harmonious effortlessly smoothly naturally easily straightforward quickly conveniently efficiently properly practically effectively neatly cleanly tidy comfortably warmly cozy sweetheart dear honey baby darling adorable cutie cute cupid charming beautiful pretty fancy attractive stylish cool hot friendly fun exciting interesting amusing enjoyable cheerful happy good luck wishing everyone happiness everywhere celebrating special occasions merry holiday season joyous new year",
