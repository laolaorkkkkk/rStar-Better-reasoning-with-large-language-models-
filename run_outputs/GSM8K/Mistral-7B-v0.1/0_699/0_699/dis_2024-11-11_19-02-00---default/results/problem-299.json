        " drives 30 (round trip) x 250 = 7,500 miles/year. Calculate cost based on price per mile. Since charging rate was mentioned as \"$2\" per mile, multiply this quantity ($2 /mile) by his annual usage (miles). Therefore, Annual charge= Price X Quantity. This implies Total Cost =$2/(mi.)*7500(mil./yr)=$15000/year. As stated earlier; every employee receives additional reimbursement i.e., Bonus Amount($150)/month or Bonus amount/year=$150x12= $1800/year . Sum up all charges together which equals to base payment+bonus=(annual Charge)+Bonus Payment ,i.e,$1500+$1800=$3300/anually spent via Driving Service! ",

Here we see that throughout one calendar year, his employer pays a sum of $150 as both cash & services. Add these extra charges up alongwith what you calculated earlier .
