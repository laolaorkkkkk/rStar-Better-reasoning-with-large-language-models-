Calculate as follow; Firstly calculate amount of flower grown before death i.e., Number of Flower Grown Before Death= No.of Flowers Planting Per Day*No.of Days Planted During This Time Period(Before Loss). From context you can extract values like no.flowers plant daily which was equal to one half so we substitute them into formula=>Number Of FLOWERS GROWN BEFORE DEATH= \u00bdFLOWERS/DAY*15DAYS =>Given Values Substitution->N\u00b0OF FLOWS PLANTED DURING THIS TIME PERIOD EQUIVALENT TO N\u00b0 OF THE FLOWER HAVE DIES AND LEFT BETWEEN DAY 1 \u2013 DAY 15 WITHIN REMAINDER WILL CONTAIN ONLY FACTORIES AT MOMENT IS NOT SPECIFIED BY VALUE SO USING NOVELTY NAME COORDINATES FOR EXPRESSIVE DESCRIPTION.

We find out condition one would mean twice times quantity X equals amount grown because Ryan puts two seeds every single day so our equation becomes y=2X but it says half didn't come up so this means only other half came up right hence meaning all those grew therefore adding zero onto y since none died or went missing. Since ryan was able keep consistent record through nth term arithmetic sequence formula could apply here! To solve problems like these using sequences you generally need constant factors common across differences btw terms within them; i guess just take advantage when available such formulas help simplify stuff quite nicely especially dealing w/ long periods without additional constraints besides simple counting patterns etc .

That becomes 2(flowers/per day)*15(days)=  2F_D=30 .
