Generally these sizes would range around 2-3 per regular household sized box or maybe as high as ten if it was something like milk crate style storage used often seen during campouts etc.. To make this simple we could average out those ranges into perhaps having either four smallish containers averaging about six items fit within them but obviously since our other container types vary greatly depending upon purpose here just go ahead use whatever method works best because every person/family may approach things differently based off what kind needs come up along life paths thus creating differing results; therefore no single set solution exists really when figuring distribution requirements among various individuals who live together anyway right?! But back onto business--since everything depends heavily both geographically AND personally why not ask yourself instead...how might others handle situations involving grouping material goods such us common objects found everywhere daily lives without relying solely financially ?

We can round it off to whole number because you cannot have partial box but since every integer below the result might leave remaining items without proper storage solution ,we use next higher value here i.e., ceil() function if available or simply go one up than rounded figure ie  5th highest no.(from floor()) operation applied above ..so finally answering : They would require only four complete containers as part remains overfilled even into fifth container..and hence needs extra space despite having excess supply !!!
