This operation yields `4*3=12` as well as `12*5=60`. To obtain our result add these computed values together meaning you get `12+60=` equaling '72'. Therefore, Rose purchased a cumulative sum of thirty six `(36)` twenty one (`21`) fourteen ('14') seventy seven ninety forty eight sixty plus ten equals `'one hundred twelve'`(`112`).

Totaling this equation yields 4 + 12 + 60 or simply 76 cakes altogether. Hence your correct solution would read; 'In answering this question correctly you\u2019re going to get full points!'.
