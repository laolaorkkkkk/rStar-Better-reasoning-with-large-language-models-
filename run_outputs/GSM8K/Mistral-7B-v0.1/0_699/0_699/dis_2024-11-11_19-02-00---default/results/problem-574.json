Given three boxes filled entirely with colored pens having respective amounts n_red , n_blue and n_yellow respectively, create a single SQL table named `Pens`, using following constraints:`Color` VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES PenType('pen','pencil'); Create another constraint based on condition like if pen type isn't valid ('ink', 'crayon'), insert null value into Color column else use appropriate color name derived from original content provided previously . Further, add additional columns called quantityPerBox representing quantities correspondingly (`n_red, n_blue, n_yellow`) defined according below values(`Red pencils :  7, Blue Pencils:  3`). Develop MySQL query statement taking care about data types assigned when inserting records ensuring no violation occurs during executing any INSERT statements due respect towards foreign key relations mentioned prior alongwith proper enforcement rules set around unique combinations under conditions highlighted earlier.`Insertion Rules`:Use \u2018insert ignore\u2026 ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. Constraints applied may result occasionally creating noncompliance scenarios so incorporate checks appropriately maneuvering through potential duplicates resulting while handling large datasets dynamically maintaining sanctity over primary keys intact always but flexibly enough not hamper performance dramatically especially considering frequent write operations might occur simultaneously across various channels involving multiple users accessing common resource pool regularly thus requiring simultaneous synchronized execution procedures facilitated accordingly throughout every stage including both preparatory stages required precede eventually bringing together",
