All together these equate to  240+120+90=450. We know editing accounts for just one activity so let us use those exact numbers divided further like what percent would exactly equal out if you expressed them only off of their actual length not all combined into 'the rest'. Since editings stands alone taking place individually its own quantity takes precedence thus instead of considering cumulative calculation lets subtract recorded since clearly wrote comes first before any subsequent stages hence calculated below; written becomes initial input here followed immediately succeeded next stage waking through both prior steps whilst simultaneously allowing forthcoming events subsequently culminate once executed appropriately upon reaching desired output thereby yielding following results listed itemized accordingtooutlined guidelinesthereforecalculatedasfollowsobjectivelyevaluatenowwereleftwithaftercombinationanalysisincludingrecordingperformedexclusivityduringeditancelementarystageonlyindividualactivitiesconsideredseparatorbetweeninputcomponentsoutputsynergiesensuccessfulcompletionofprimarygoalprecedinglyacknowledgedabovewhereinterrelationamongsubordinateentailmentbeheldprestigefullyaccomplicatetoocomplexfordirectsolvingyondergeneralintroductionrequirementsunderlainsimplermethodologyemploybasicmathematicallogicconceptualintegrityinformationalcumulationalliteralapplicationbasedpracticumstipulatedcomputationalstepshereinafterassumeinitialstatepresentbeforeanyadditionsorchangesapplyingdesireedaimprovementendgofromthenextpointfirmamentinalgebrausingoperatorsarithmeticprocessuntilfinalresultproducepercentageequivalentevaluerelativetooriginalconditiotalquantitattotalityfoundearlierphaseidentifiablefirstinstanceactuallyinitiatedsecondstagesequentiallymaintainprogressiveupgradesandreliablereportmeasurequalityofworkthroughinnormalunitslike%convertsecondsintominutesproportionalscaletothenarrowdowntoclosesextentrelativeobservabilitygivencertaintimeperiodallowinspecificcontextuseexampledetail",

Lastly take said resulting ratio figure out into percentile form so roughly ~77%. Therefore, our calculated approximation tells us about 77% of Carol\u2019s full effort was put toward merely finishing off its finished product via touchups rather than coming right out fresh onto paper like other creative processes typically involve when one first crafts their artistic composition.

And since you want edit/total_minutes*100%, let\u2019s calculate percentages accordingly! Firstly we need to find out what %editing represents compared to all combined activities . Since Carol edited one part last minute out of four equal parts together , this can also mean division : 90 / ((4x60)+(120)) *100% because working hrs equate totals minuts !..This calculator tells us about such math expressions too https://www.symbolab.com/solver/approximation-calculator Approximately %.",

Adding up these times yields Carol\u2019s total working time as  4 (writing) + 2 (recording) + 1.5 (editing) = 7.5 hours. To find out what fraction this represents for just editing, divide your edit duration, i.e., 1.5/7.5= . This comes down to multiplying that result (.2) by 100% yieldings a whopping 20%.

Finally multiply your result times 100 to obtain percent form results yield ~20%. Thus, Carol spent roughly 20% of her effort doing edits compared to overall production work.

And lastly adding up those times would get us (4+2)+(0.5*2) hrs ((as per unit conversion)), so we obtaining (4+(2/2))= 4+1 or  5 Hours; Hence Total Time Spent Writing Music Is equal To T_tgtHence let\u2019s find out Editing Percentage : We can use This Equation below P_editPartsOutOfTotalQuantityEQUATIONWhere Quantity here refers to Amount Of TimeSpentFor CompletionCalculated Using MultiplicationWe observe as Below That As Calculated From Problem Statement ;EditTimeIsEqualToWritingAndRecordingTogetherMultipliedByPercentPartitionAsPerProblemStatement Which Refers Itself Or Implicitely IndicatesThat edit partionSharesEqualityWithWritingandrecording partsAlsoReferableFrom",
        "/2) hours + 90 minutes or 2 hours managing. We need to convert all times into same unit first before we can add them up easily; let us use 'hours'. It means our equation becomes 4 + 2 + 1.5=7.5 Total Time Spent Writing & Recording Song Is Equal To Summation Of Those Three Times Which Are All Converted Or Simplified As Minutes First And Second Part Should Have Been Used With Same Units Here Since Hour Represents Larger Unit But Both Mentioned Values Contained Only Half Hour Means That They Represent Smaller Duration Than One Hour While Calculating Total Effort Made By Anybody Towards An Occasion Focus Must Come Up On Manually Changing Their Relative Sizes Because Otherwise When Adding Everything Together This Problem Could\u2019ve Very Well Caused Some Confusion Due To Unconsciously Using Multiple Size Units Within Single Statement Like Describing Two Fractions Out Of Sixteenth Each Instead Let\u00b4s Consider Another Real Life Example Where These Situations Arise Frequently Suppose I Am Walking My Dog Every Day Before Sunrise At Night Just Think About Such Scenarios Even Though No Specific Formula Exists Regarding Converting Given Periodical Durations From Various Lengthened Expressions Being Combined Under Opposite Conditions Remember Painstakingly Practicing Algebraic Skills Can Help You Solving Quirky Issues Presented Inside Mathematics "
