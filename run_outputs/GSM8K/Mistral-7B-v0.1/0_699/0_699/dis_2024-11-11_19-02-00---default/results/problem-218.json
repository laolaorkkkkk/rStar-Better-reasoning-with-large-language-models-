Here are mathematical models describing these conditions; let 'A', 'H' stand for their present ages while H=21 stands fixed through all steps until calculating the mentioned arithmetic figure ('average').   Firstly condition states **\"Conditional Equation :** `Age_of_(Adrian)= Age_of_harriet*3` which translates mathematically into ```python     equation(a) <- h*3``` or equivalently , `(eq)\u2190h*(3)` since we know harriet=`h`, equalling it back yields us adrian's age `'a'` .
