Therefore, I would say verna received 16dollars back as change! This means her original sum before making payment amounts just to itself plus whatever additional cash/change one receives due to lack of having paid exactly enough.. Which comes up nicely here since you need only account once using all available information thus getting us right answers quickly... Hope this helps clear things further ;) Thanks again :) Great job providing such detailed info & explanation !!!! Keep those responses coming!! It really helped me understand better\u2026 Cheers ^_^ Bye btw thanks buddy :)) ",
