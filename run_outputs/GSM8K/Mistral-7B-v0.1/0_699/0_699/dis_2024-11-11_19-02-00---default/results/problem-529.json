Since one item (CD) costs $4, therefore subtracting this amount ($4), we learn that excluding buying any other product like Headphones, means having extra funds which could let him acquire another single unit i.e., add further units purchased thus increasing potential quantity obtained through division again but using updated divisor value as original divided minus removed part(one).

Therefore when considering just whole items since fractional units can't physically exist ,we conclude that he wouldn\u2019t purchase any additional CDs because selling off the saved up funds may yield less than the expense linked to acquiring new equipment like music devices/headsets etc., thus potentially hindering enjoyment derived directly out it 's usage!

Total amount available without considering any other items or expenses can simply subtract this known price ($4). Hence, it becomes, $48-$4=$44$. This implies that Tom could use all remaining funds($44$) just for purchasing additional same priced units i.e., CDs which costs$4/unit$, so basically calculating $\\frac{TotalAvailableFundssinceHeadPhonesePurchased}{UnitPrice}$. Mathematically its equal to :$\\frac{$44}{$4}= \\boxed{11}$more unit(CD as asked initially.)So essentially Tom spent entire rest balance among himself due to purchase decision about unrelated extra stuff like Headphone,$whichcouldhavebeenavoided$ifjustpouredallavailablefundsinotherselftogethisrequestfulproductofinterest.$i.e$manyunitspossibletodrinkahefavouritebeerherewithoutspendingextra$$\\blacklozenge$ I hope your wish comes true here!! :-)",
