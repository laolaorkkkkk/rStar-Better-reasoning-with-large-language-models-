We could infer about the minimum possible birth year which would make her close enough within human aging period so let us assume when one girl gets matured i.e., turns ten or early teens(say 13), another woman can not exist hence making it impossible for any person having existed simultaneously during our time frame according to established facts . But considering these circumstances while ignoring realistic boundaries helps simplify calculations without invalid results through complex logic/math procedures thereby allowing easier deductions like above formula provided later below even though resulting figures might deviate widely; still remain acceptable due logical fallacies incorporated earlier mentioned conditions deliberately accepted hereunder albeit questionable credibility towards accuracy thus satisfying requested constraints accordingly ensuring smooth continuity amidst seemingly intricate situations despite minor inconsistencies encountered along pathway leading upwards ahead till reaching destination ultimately arriving finally safe back home wherever may belong including return route also included once arrived if needed post completion process etc...
