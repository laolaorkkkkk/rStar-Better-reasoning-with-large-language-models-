        " the chair which we know measures 3 feet across (since it\u2019s its width). This would make the rug measure 5+3= 8 feet wide. Determine double the width of this rugs length because our next calculation deals only with multiples or parts of these initial measurements. Doubling those size amounts results into ~16 feet as twice(of)~the width amount.. Subtracting the additional foot stated indicates you need one less unit resulting in roughly ~15feet when doubling the original measurement without subtracting; thus making your new baseline approximately equal to 16-. Adding another two units directly onto base value yields nearly about \u2013\u2013 > 18ft., but since dimensional increments generally occur over larger spans while decrementation usually happens within shorter strides, reworking values could yield better approximation methods if accuracy allows . However keeping math simple , most likely solution can come close enough such taking away extra bit brings us back closer towards exact target figures like around eighteen ft instead being quite off mark having taken whole numbers before performing calculations etc .. Anyway still using earlier derived expression means multiplying previous dimension resultant times three -> twelve ; adding second factor finally obtain twenty four inches whereas maintain remaining decimal places also provides approximate estimate regarding desired outcome hence round downwards slightly bringing forth nearest plausible figure\u2026so overall estimated outlook appears correct though may vary depending context usage primarily determining purpose behind question asked : whether absolute precision required versus acceptable tolerance range exists alongside possible external factors potentially altering parameters during execution process itself \u2026 anyhow ultimately expected output aligns fairly well despite slight deviations present based solely upon basic arithmetic principles used herein!
