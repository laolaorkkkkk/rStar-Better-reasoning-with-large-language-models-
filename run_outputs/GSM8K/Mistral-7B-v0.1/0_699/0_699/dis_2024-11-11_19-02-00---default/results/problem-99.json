Next, considering that she plans to remove one plant per window sill (which totals out as removing half the amount existing). This leaves us with only halves i.e., 80/2=<<80/2=40>>40 remaining. Finally, adding those freshly purchased ones yields up; so 40+18=<<40+18=58>>58 flowers or other such living objects! ",
