Additionally, it takes one pack of clothes ('$$') worth '$5', making your products necessary resources or commodities you buy. Calculate overall revenue using mentioned numbers. As stated above we know initially having 3 extra folks joining makes our count equal eight ($(total_clients=initial+additional)) times combined consumption of items sold multiplied by price results into this equation $$($(8*((bleachprice*$quantity)+clothesprice)*income), hence here ((2*$2+$5)$per_client*(number_of_clients)=$(Revenue)). Find out net earnings through subtraction; since profits equals sales minus operating overhead expressed mathematically being -(expense-$revenue). Last calculate expected gains/earnings based off known figures.$$-(-($profit=$(8*$6-$92))) Simplifying the expression inside brackets first before going ahead further yields $$=(netEarnings=$8*$6-$92)$$Net Earnings becomes NetIncome after dropping superfluous units such as symbols not partaking any numerical value$.

Next comes determining the expenses since these affect directly upon profits being made outrightly through subtractive action during its calculation.
