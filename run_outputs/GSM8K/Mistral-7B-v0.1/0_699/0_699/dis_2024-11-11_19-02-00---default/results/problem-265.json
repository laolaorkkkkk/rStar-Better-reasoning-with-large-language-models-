This question requires addition or subtraction to find out exactly one amount missing.(Asking specifically about extra vs initial costs so no multiplication involved.) Since Total Cost including all percentages is bigger than Budget , we need further computation..We add it up :- Initial value:$x+$Bfw+$tfw >>>>>   $350 k+ $17.5 K + $$42K + $31 K > ----~$440 000 More expensive by ~~$$40 thousand~~dollar...So your best fit choice would come down only if other considerations like mortgage rates etc., could allow you making affordable compromises regarding location preferences ..In conclusion while shopping around within financial boundaries take into account factors such as home appreciation values against locality standards / amenities present ... Also ensure potential loan approval based upon income verification beforehand rather rushing purchases .... Happy House hunting!!!!! I hope my extensive explanation helps ! Best Wishes !! Regards....

Brokerage Fee Total Amount Transferred Price Transfer Fee Percent Multiply (.05)(350000)=$17500 To find the actual rate paid calculate as follows; Divide the portion transferred into smaller groups until it matches one whole group ($1). This way we know if what our result came out equal or lesser/greater compared to the original inputted data/$1 spent per group here means whether Maria saved $$ or spendinh more... Our initial cost was just like grouping all numbers but once grouped....we knew everything became easier when dividing especially dealing larger amounts! What about taxes? They come up every time someone tries something new--from clothes shopping online(for instance), making purchases through apps etc.--which makes us feel good knowing these things aren\u00b4t really necessary anymore thanks tech advances coming along faster!!! We don`t need them anyway since most websites provide free shipping options without additional costs unlike traditional malls!! Why care? Because sometimes trying products offline may yield different results due lack experience regarding specific items whereas exploring alternatives via internet allows experimentation whilst maintaining control over desired outcome expectations beforehand.. It doesn\u00b4re usually worth spending extra cash saving valuable energy avoid learning mistakes later ;-) Do keep track while using services offering no strings attached rates however always lookout any hidden charges whenever possible keeping expenses low helps overall feeling positive towards life going forward thus improving quality daily existence itself .

When this cost adds up against Mr.Cruz\u2019 budget i.e.,($350 000+$59 500)=[$409 500], it exceeds her maximum limit ($400 000) hence overshooting exactly $(409 500-$400 000), thus being greater by $$9 500 compared to what was within her specified finances..

Adding these extra costs ($59 500), we get the actual cost as $350 000 (original price) + $59 500 (fees) = $409 500. Thus, it exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $409 500 - $400 000 = $9 500.

Adding this cost to the initial selling price gives us a grand total cost of $350 000 + $59 500 = $409 500 spent overall. Subtracting Mrs. Cruz\u2019s original budget leaves $(409,500 - 400,000) or \\$9,500 over what was allocated in her financial plan; thus amounting to $___. ",
        " these fees amount to $17 500 + $42 000 = $59 500. Adding this cost to the original price results in $350 000 + $59 500= $409 500 as a new total sum due to additional costs. Therefore, exceeding Mrs. Cruz\u2019s specified range means it goes over by ($409 500 \u2013$400 000)=$9 500 or if expressed differently since both figures represent currency (in USD), consider them using dollar signs without quotes beforehand like $, thus we can express $$ in general form rather simply stating \u201cIn excess\u201d. Hence, the result would still remain \"$\" representing monetary surplus value when considering numerical representation alone. However, incorporated within contextual narratives while discussing finance matters pertaining towards home purchasing operations one might tend toward specifying exact financial denominations encompassing traditional notation system i.e., 'US Dollars'.

This means our calculation was correct all along even though someone else thought differently due potentially misunderstanding basic math concepts related specifically applicable towards finance like taxation rates etc..

Good luck out friends (: :D Cheers!! LOL XD :-P",
        " 500. This means the additional cost totals $59 500. The total amount paid would therefore add this extra charge onto the base asking price; i.e., Base Price ($350 000)+ Extra Charge ($59 500)= Total Paid Out ($409 500). Therefore exceeding Mary\u2019s maximum spending limit or available capital by $9 500 $(409 500 \u2013 400 000=  9 500$ . Thus it follows that, 'The ",
        " maximum budget was $400 thousand or 'B', while the asking cost is '$350 thousand plus additional expenses'. Here, those other charges are expressed as percentages related to sale price i.e., a combined rate equivalent to 5%+12%=17%. These extra rates need to be considered when calculating overall outlay; therefore multiplying them over base value ($350 thousands). Following this rule yields result= Base Cost X Existing Rate(%) /Rate Conversion Factor+(Excess Charges/(Base Value*Conversion)). Apply these values into formula would yield Total Expenditure=(Cost PriceXProportion)+ExtraExpCharges/Summation_Of_Initials&AdditionalRatios$=\\$(350thousands\\times(\\frac{Percent}{100}))+\\$\\frac{(Brokerage\\%ofPrice+\\TransferFee\\%ofPrice)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(initial\\_cost_rate+additional_charge)\\}=$($350K*\\frac{17}{100})+$($350K*(0.05+0.12))==$59k+$36.75k. Hence summing primary charge alongside any supplementary ones together equals Tototal=$(PrimaryCharge+$Supplemental)=($350K+$59k+$36.75k)=~$445.75k$. Therefore, subtracting initial financial plan B('Her max spending limit') from our newly calculated figure reveals Differential Amount=-[(FinalTotal)-Plan]-$400 k-$[$445.75 k]=$-[(-44.75 K)$. This computation implies deduction operation owing totall higher investment required leading us towards negative indicating undercutting requirement relative to initially established fiscal capacity implicating shortfall amount hence $-[$400 k]$ becomes surplus suggesting addition consequent due to decreased consumption ability resulting positive disparity being derived equaling $$44.75 million thereby concluding solution thus Final ",
