Dividing those thirty-six portions into three parts mean splitting eight tons per person hence every one gets four pound(four divided by three) but since we cannot practically handle fractions or decimals when handling something like quantities here, therefore round off accordingly as appropriate such that no portion remains unaccounted thereby resulting in sixteen rounded downwards equals about half minus one third becomes fifteen pounds thus everyone possesses slightly less than equal part of shared items while retaining fairness .

First add up your initial quantities (total quantity):  3+5+4=12 pounds altogether To divide among three people evenly I need to calculate the whole amount divided by the divisor which here as stated earlier is 'three'. Thus dividing our previous result into thirds yields .. .the exact same thing as multiplying sixths times three equals twelve thus , every one gets sixteen twelfth or just over half a pound each And that\u2019s about right \u2013 those bars above show us using fractions\u2026 let me simplify these figures further : One fifth + Two fourth (+One) makes Three halves (* means multiplication). Half Divided ByThree -> Twelve Over Six / 3 --> Four Pounds Per Person !

To find out how much each one gets we simply need to take these combined amounts (12) and divide it by 3 which results into about  4 pounds per person if distributed fairly amongst all. Thus, Each person ends up having roughly 4 pounds of candy including Robert, Cindy, and Aaron individually as well since sharing doesn\u2019t change individual portions but distributes overall quantity equitably. Therefore, 'Each', referring back refers both collectively and individually stands correct here too while considering rounding off decimal parts due to uneven division like '. .'. But specifically addressing your request not exceed beyond whole numbers without decimals hence just focusing purely on integer values excludes any such fractional part leading everyone exactly unto receiving same count i.e., four pound or equal shares respectively thus avoiding complexities involved when dealing fractions/decimal points etc; This keeps things simpler aligning better towards understanding basic math operations typically taught & expected in standard academic settings thereby offering clarity over nuanced details especially critical during early learning stages \u2013 essential foundation building phase!

        " 4 = 12 pounds combined. Divide this evenly among themselves (which makes three people) so each one gets 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy. They would all end up having four pounds of candy each if pooled together as per equal distribution because division indicates splitting or distributing quantities into identical parts under equality conditions which fits here perfectly. The answer is: 4.",
        " 3 pounds initially, but it also mentions about him acquiring 'extra candies.' These extra candies increase his initial quantity which needs to be factored while calculating totals. Hence, add these numbers considering as additional quantities i.e., starting weights become (3+x)+(5)=12 pound, therefore find out value of \u2018x\u2019 using this equation; consequently, substitute back into original amounts & follow similar calculations based upon addition/subtraction concepts applied previously during resolving individual problems.. As per calculation earlier mentioned \u2013 if we subtract existing weights from pooled weight then distribute evenly amongst three persons equal shares can deduce individually without needing precise data regarding acquired excess items post Halloween event. Thus every person ends up getting exactly half portion irrespective whatever was collected later on night festival proceedings since overall collective reserves get split uniformly sans influencing preexisting contributions made prior festivity culmination moment itself!

        " of candy. Therefore, initially we add these numbers together which equals 3+5+4=12 pound(weight unit) or simply put, 12 pounds worth of candies all rounded into one single sum as it was mentioned without any specified measurements apart from this weight (pounds). Next considering everyone gets equal shares when pooled; since three people shared among themselves so dividing overall mass i.e., divided per individual\u2019s portion hence calculated next part under consideration here being division rule applied over initial accumulated quantity resulting calculation thus obtainable upon executing basic arithmetic operation known commonly referred back across various educational background domains typically studied & used consistently during early learning stages primarily focusing directly towards elementary school mathematics curriculum topics revolving fundamentals including but limited only unto operations within field identified distinctly amongst primary level study subjects comprising fundamental knowledge units covering specific sets related rules regarding numerical manipulations involving four broad groups namely addition subtraction multiplication along with sharing process outlined through conceptual understanding relating essentially partitioning sums particularly highlighting relevant cases linked inclusively intertwining certain mathematical concepts potentially introducing students onto foundational groundwork lay down baseline principles establishes core principals enabling deeper future explorations beyond surface levels whilst simultaneously encouraging critical thinking strategies employed sequentially linking diverse components harmoniously fostering logical reasoning abilities cultivated progressively allowing advanced comprehension maturity developments subsequently reinforcing importance promoting lifelong learnings advocating continued growth embracement evolved approach adaptability skills applying versatile techniques accommodating emerging challenges encountered throughout journey personal intellectual advancements further shaping individuals societal contributions ensuring collective wellbeing prosperity enhancement global cooperation unity solidarity peace stability balance justice equality fairness respect tolerance acceptance diversity celebration cultures traditions appreciate world treasures cherish human potentialities honor accomplishment achievements recognizing hardworking efforts deserving recognition reward gratitude showcasing merit based acknowledgments appreciative expressions sincere compliments heartfelt thanks genuine praises positive reinforce construct healthier relationships stronger families tight community networks inspiring hope motivate change impact transform society sustainably contribute meaningfully elevate standards quality lives improve conditions make difference matter matters influence every actions thoughts feelings decisions consequences repercussions reverberations echo far ranging reaching distant corners resonate vibrant powerful messages compelling action stir emotions provoke passions kindle fires ignite",
        " (for Robert) plus 5 pounds of candy (for Cindy), which equals to 8 pounds of candy; then adding 4 pounds of sugar candies (that belongs to Aaron). Therefore we find out the combined weight was actually only  8 + 4 = 12 pound(s) instead of summing up all three amounts together as stated above. Since when they agree upon pooled sharing it means evenly dividing among themselves so let us figure out what happens if Alice shares this entirety along equal parts since Bob can\u2019t hold any additional piece than those already owned individually prior to merging resources collectively here \u2013 according our calculation , divide into fractions such every one gets exactly half portion right away because     \\\\(\\dfrac{n}{m}=\\\\)\\((number)\\\\\\ \\(divided)\\) / \\ \\(denominator\\) i .e., \\(\\frac{12pounds }{ 3 people }=\\dfrac {12} {3}=\\color{",
        " This means if the three pooled together, dividing 12 pounds evenly amongst themselves resulted in (12 pounds) / 3 individuals equals or equal sharing among all parties involved; therefore, upon equitable division every individual receives six pound(s).
