Subtract the actual sales figure from Target Sales to identify if any deficiency exists or surplus exist etc as per whether it\u2019s positive or negative. To determine discrepancy/surplus we calculate  120(target)-65(actual sale); thus signifying a shortfall instead of gain against expected targets implying Surpise Deficit.

His goal thus cannot happen unless it increases to accommodate fewer productive hours spent. Therefore, since Sam needs approximately 94 additional crates beyond reaching his typical sales goals based on standard operations levels when running seven full days a week, he fell short of meeting his original monthly targets last week even considering the unusual circumstances resulting in decreased operational time during said period.

Assuming one normal workweek consists of Monday through Friday i.e., 5 working days except those when he didn\u2019t close shop \u2013 namely Monday or else it would exceed the normative timeline. Therefore recalculated daily amount equalling what ought to normally occur throughout such duration implies dividing into half pertaining available operational span thereby arriving again at similar figures; halving figure procured above provides approximately thirty four point seventy seven units whereas extrapolated quota via multiplication exhibiting sixteen times said quotient amasses eight hundred sixty four minus already tabulated cumulative totals subtractively yields three ninety six divergence rendering positive output.

Summing what\u2019s given yields so far; calculate using simple addition only when necessary: add every individual daily sale quantity provided until you reach a specified date which doesn't provide specific values such as 'the whole previous week.' Calculate again considering available data about actual numbers stated throughout our steps priorly\u2014which includes both directly supplied figures per instance & partial expressions like \"$total \u2013 X\" terms relating back upon themselves within their respective scenarios thus potentially complicating things further depending solely based also whether said variable remains unspecified later during subsequent calculations).

        " except those already counted as part of 'weekend sales'. This includes only Tuesday (15), Wednesday (12) & Thursday(18). Thus sum equals 15+12+18=45. Add this daily count along with the previously calculated weekend sales; thus we get the actual sale amount which sums upto 45+(20)=65 Crates. Subtracting these accumulated figures i.e., Total_Actual_Crates Sold \u2013 Target Value results into the difference/shortage. Here it computes being (Total Actual value\u2013target): 65-(120) resulting negative figure indicating shortfall not surpassing target i.e., \u221255 Crates.
