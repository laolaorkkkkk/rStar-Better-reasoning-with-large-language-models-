We know that Saturday\u2019s dance session was \u201ctwice\u201d longer than compared Sunday\u2019s schedule \u2013 it means we need multiply sessions amounting to normal school or homework activity scheduled on previous said days (Tue/Thu) by factor equals to 'two'. Dance on saturday takes six times longer comparing regular routine happening since start till sunday . Let us sum things like this : Duration=TimeToDoSomeHomeWork+DanceSessionDurationOnNormalDays\u00d7Factor(NumberOfLessons). As such , our formula looks smth similar to following example:- TimeFromAcademyForPracticing=(SchoolAndStudiesIncludingOtherChoresBeforeGoingHome)*MathematicalMultiplier ;We simply just put correct values into variables described previously\u2026 And obtain calculated result.- HomeOfficeSetup=\"Eight\";var TotalWeeklyDancingSpan=TotalSchoolTimetable*(MathFact*x)+AdditionalAmountofDanceSpacingPerweek;where:`$math_factor` defines whether task needs extra attention \u2014 `Two``*`timeAtAcad\u00e9mieforpracticing``+$additionalfortimeinperformance;`Given factored equation yields :- $d=\\left(\\begin{matrix} \\text{\\$} \\\\%\\end{matrix}\\right)$ Hence according above calculation when performing right mathematical operations you get : $$\\\\$(t)=$e+\\text{(m)}\\times\\left({\\frac {2}{\\%}}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{matrix}\\textbf{\\$} & \\\\-\\phantom{\\rule{1em}{0ex}}&\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle 1}}{=} {\\cdot }\\textbf{:}& {}&&{:}\\\\ &\\mbox{$\\mid \\$}$}& {:}(f)(g)& \\\\&=& 8\\mid \\!{}1&:\\\\ &=&~6~\\!\\mathrm{h}~~~~~~~~~~$,Where:$a=\\{$$\\, \\$,\\qquad \\left(\\begin{matrix}\\mbox{$--$\\hspace{-0.5mm} m_{\\mathrm h}\\,\\textrm{%}}$ } \\!\\mid\\mkern1mu \\quad \\mid\\kern-0.5mu $\\,$ %\\,\\qquad  \t\t\\qquad\\qquad\\mbox{$==$-}$-${}^{-}=-} ~~~~~~~ \\, \\{*\\}$$\\\\\\;b=$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$^{[\\lnot]$}$^{\\big($",
        " per week spent practicing dancing. Firstly determine Saturday\u2019s dance time which would be Twice as long as the Wednesday so it becomes doubled or (2*T) making this equal to (2*1)=2 hours because we know that Halls daily routine comprises half an houre(half hr). Summarize these amounts; Total=(Hours)-[(summationofhoursspentinpracticethisweek)]=Total((h)+W+(f)+t+k)=2,(where:(w meanswedensday)(r meaning rathunday),(b meaningsaturday))so when you add them up equals(2+1+2+2)= 7 . Therefore ,we can say hallie spend seven hours every week for practise alone without break down into certain specific activities such as ballet/jazz etc..

That makes it thirtyfour total minutes during all four lessons including Saturday\u2019s extra time spent practicing because twenty-three*(seconds)/sixty+(minutes)= sixty-(one hundred twelve seconds)-ten additional minute breaks.

Given that 'Tuesday=x', which equals one unit/hour according to your description(where you compare Saturday session times), \u2018Thursday\u2019 also gets another unit equaling two units due to doubled attendance relative to Tuesday but not explicitly stating otherwise because every other point aligns well within basic arithmetic rules like doubling values etc., while disregarding ambiguities around specific numbers presented earlier such as half an episode playing speed boosters under certain conditions related to energy bars consumption\u2014the rest remains straightforward until concluding steps required.
