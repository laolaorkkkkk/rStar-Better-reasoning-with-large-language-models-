Lastly add extra nonbedroom specific ones(which happens only once):   12+4=16 . Hence finally adding them together yields you Total ",

Since we have those homes as doubles so it would mean we need to calculate double them too which leads us to this equation : n*n , meaning 10 squared equals **100** . The answer is: 100. Let me know if you want steps explained further or I can assist even deeper. It was good enough what I said but wanted also detailed explanation/solution Please let your request clarify! To provide a comprehensive solution here, considering John's situation regarding the windows in both houses involves several calculations related to counting individual elements within different categories (bedrooms versus common area) across multiple units (houses). Here's a detailed breakdown process explaining these calculations one might follow under various circumstances when dealing with similar problems involving quantities spread over multiples entities like housing examples presented above:  ",

Oh also if you want i could make another one easier but let ur own brain solve most things before asking too easy stuff ;) hahaha... ok maybe just ask once u really dont understand something here no matter what :P btw hope yall enjoyed my explanation :) thanks again guys keep those great answers coming (; P)",
