        " hour than Ruiz, so Marissa makes 60 x (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour. Working for twelve hours means both could potentially work all their time within this frame. Total poundage produced would be [(Marissa\u2019s production rate)*(number of working hours)]+[(Ruiz\u2019s production rate)*(number of working hours)]. That translates into [45*(12)]+(60*12)=[540]+[720]=1260 pounds combined. Hence, if they worked for 12 hours continuously without breaks or interruptions like getting tired etc., They might produce about 1,260 pounds of cocoa altogether over those same period. Conclusion, based on these conditions it was found out that collectively they created approximately 1260 pounds worth of delicious goodies when functioning side by side nonstop under said circumstances.

Therefore, together they will make up 1260 units if every unit represents .001 pound(given this statement).
