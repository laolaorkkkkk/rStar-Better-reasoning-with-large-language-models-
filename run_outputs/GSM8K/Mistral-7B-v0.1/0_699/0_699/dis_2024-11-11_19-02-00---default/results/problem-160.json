To maximize profit at the end of this month, we need to compare the projected value of jewelry versus the electronic gadgets. The jewelry is currently worth $5,000. Projected value of jewelry is $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125. Electronic gadgets are currently worth $8,000. Projected value of electronics is $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096. Comparing the two projected values, the projected value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096) is greater than the projected value of the jewelry ($5,125).

This can be a trick question because it doesn't state which of the two plans is better. I assume the merchant is choosing between purchasing jewelry for $5,000 or electronic gadgets for $8,000. Let's see if we can calculate the profit for both plans. First let's see what happens to the values of the items when the markets increase. Electronic gadgets increases to $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096$. Jewelry increases to $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,250$. Next we need to look at the profits from selling the items. We know that the merchant gets $8,096$ - $8,000$ = $96$ dollars for selling the electronic gadgets. But that doesn't tell us about the amount of profit for jewelry. So let's find out what the profit is by solving for $x$. Since the merchant sells jewelry for $5,250$ and paid $5,000$, he makes $5,250$ - $5,000$ = $250$ dollars profit. Now that we found out that the merchant makes $96$ dollars for selling electronic gadgets and $250$ dollars for selling jewelry, we can compare them to see who made more profit. $96 < 250$, so the merchant sold jewelry for $5,250$ dollars, and made $5,250$ - $5,000$ = $250$ dollars profit.
