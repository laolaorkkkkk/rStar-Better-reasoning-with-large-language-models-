Divide the outstanding payment due into full weekly rates equivalent to what he earns every working period which consists entirely of part time jobs worth $.($rate/hr)*(hours worked)=full weeks required*.$pay rate=earnings necessary$. We know he gets approximately$25 per week$, so we can set up the equation like thus:$((remainingBalance)/Hourly Pay Rate)^weeksRequired*$hourlyPayRate=$Earnings Needed$.

        " To find out how long George needs to work before having enough to cover this amount, calculate what remains following the initial payment ($5000-$600=$4400). This means he requires earning another $4400 through working ($4400/$15=x\u2248293.33); rounded up it would take him approximately 294 additional minutes or about 4.9 hours if assuming continuous labor without breaks/interruptions. Hence, under all conditions considered; George roughly requires around ~8 hours work time until achieving sufficient funds necessary to bear full financial responsibility towards accomplishing intended healthcare endeavors necessitated concerning specific masticatory apparatus maintenance regulations pertinent thereto individualized contextually contiguous experiences encountered sequentially postulated hypothetically conceivable scenarios envisaged plausible interpretations theoretically articulated potentially subjectively assessed discernment presumably inferred likely implicative connotation extrapolate eminently relevant pragmatic practical applications practically feasibly implement reasonably probable tangibly demonstrable verifiably substantiated conclusively definitive certification decisive resolution unequivocally unambiguously indisputably irrefutable categorically absolutely affirmatively resolutely assuredly confirmed beyond doubt certainly thoroughly fully indeed truly undeniably genuinely validately credibility reliability trustworthiness authenticity legitimacy legality conformity consistency accuracy fidelity integrity quality excellence superior performance efficiency productivity effectiveness efficacy output rate speed velocity acceleration deceleration momentum force pressure strength power energy consumption conservation economy expenditure saving investment income capital assets resources labour input effort human resource potential ability capability skill development capacity growth achievement success accomplishment goal objectives target set plans strategy execution strategies goals tactics procedures steps methods activities tasks responsibilities duties functions role roles assignments projects initiatives proposals recommendations ideas suggestions innovations inventions concepts conceptualization theory theories hypothesis formulation data collection analysis statistical process computational processing mathematical calculation algorithm logic evaluation judgment criteria assessment standard benchmark against standards measure comparisons contrast differential diagnosis prognosis treatment intervention caregiving management supervision guidance mentoring training instruction educational curriculum syllabus course schedule program agenda timeline calendar date events clock timing scheduling planning organizational structures hierarchy structure chain command control coordination teamwork collaboration cooperation networking community building engagement participation involvement volunteering charitable benefaction kind",
        " $600 was paid; hence deduct this ($5000-$600=$4400). To find out how long it would take him working part time job which pays $15/hour until reach savings required, divide required value($4400/$15=per hour rate)=$293 & $\\frac{1}{3}. It means you can say about \"$293\" if rounding off since normally wages aren't calculated fractions . Thus , Geoge would approximately require around 293 hrs equivalent labor assuming every hr yields same income without any deduction or overtime compensation considerations etc.. "
