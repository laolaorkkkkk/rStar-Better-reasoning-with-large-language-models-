        " the first and second week separately (first_week and seconds_work). The problem also provides these quantities; 5 hours during the first week and 8 during the second week. To find out the amount earned we multiply this information together according to our basic understanding unitary method i.e., Earning=rate(times)time -> Earnings=(earning/hr)(hours), so calculate it as follows => Calculate both amounts individually using this formula and add them up together since no additional operation was specified. First_week's earnings equals ($10 times )x(5)=$50 & Second_week's equal($10 times)\u00d7(8)=$80 Finally subtract totals=>Subtract all results obtained above ((total sum)-(initial value))=$130-$50=${80}. Thus correct choice among options would simply reflect any addition or subtraction related calculations made through respective values mentioned within choices provided . This implies finding those expressions having direct correlation towards calculated result , hence only $(a)$ holds true because rest involve multiplication leading us away calculating exact match desired outcome here.. Hence option '$(a)' presents right conclusion thus completing required task properly !!!! Excellent work! Remember always double check your math :).. Glad you enjoyed solving problems along side me !
