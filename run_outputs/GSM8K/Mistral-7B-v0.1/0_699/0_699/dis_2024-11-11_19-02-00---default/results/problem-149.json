Which translates into six different online identities/connections within social media space known commonly referred to as having seven virtual acquaintances lesser than Charles. Conversely, since these numbers suggest that if we take twice what Daniel boasts via popular platforms like Google Plus Groups\u2013which equate their network size\u2014Dorothy stands firmly tall over eight entities.
