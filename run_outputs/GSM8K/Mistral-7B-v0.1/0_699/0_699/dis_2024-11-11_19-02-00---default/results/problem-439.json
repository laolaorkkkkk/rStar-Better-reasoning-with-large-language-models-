This question could mislead someone who may attempt calculation involving different speeds across distances thus failing to recognize actual logic behind scenario simply because no differences provided regarding variable factors like traffic condition etc., Here lies simplicity within complexity hence direct solution comes out : just add those needed extra delays , i am getting zero seconds negative meaning not applicable situation due its impossibility ..

        " walking time per mile (since we aren't told what mode of transportation she uses), so since she walks .25 mph faster [given], this implies bernadette lives about twice as far away because going half again farther would only add another minute if you went just straight out -- or roughly three blocks one direction.[clarifying] To cover those extra two blocks means either slower due to traffic/other pedestrians making things harder along routes not used by regular automobile drivers--or less traveler friendliness when arriving back through residential areas crowded during night hours... Or perhaps even slightly longer distances overall depending upon geographical circumstances involved including but certainly NOT limited among them factors such latitude latitudinal position toward equator[more likely][fairly probable]: Thus our assumption here assumes all these parameters remain constant over several years while still being able make sense within reasonable estimates based merely off numbers provided without further specific details like exactly whom drove him versus who walked around behind everybody else holding hands singing Kumbaya etc., assuming both acted normal despite seemingly odd behaviors compared against normative expectations according generally accepted societal standards involving personal interaction styles common amongst modern Americans living together physically separated yet interacting via various forms communication modes available online regardless whether technological advances made possible new ways express emotions empathy support fellow humans altruistism selflessness concern others care ethics morality principles justice fair treatment freedom rights responsibilities respect honesty integrity dignity sincerity authenticity compassion sympathy kindness generosity charitableness understanding tolerance patience listening active learning creativity productive thinking problem solving collaborative efforts teamwork cooperation helping community building mutual aid supporting causes worthwhile promoting progress society growth harmony peaceful conflict resolution negotiate compromises reconcile differences build bridges overcome barriers break down walls divide ourselves unite human race understand unity diversity difference shared values core belief systems universal truth fundamental principles life cycles evolution survival adapt development learn experience knowledge wisdom hope faith love joy happiness fulfillment satisfaction success prosperity wellbeing riches spiritual wealth health mental fit physical body mind soul spirit heart energy blood essence vital force light shine radiant beam brightening world illuminating darken corners casting aside ignorance enlighten souls minds bodies spirits bring dawn breaking darkness extinguishing flames igniting fire lights up streets pavements roads lantern houses doorsteps windowsills rooftops balconies",

        " the time it took Wayne, so this equals 4*4= 16 minutes . Since we know Bernadette likes arriving 5 mins early ,the correct calculation needs to factor this into our considerations! Therefore instead of simply subtracting the original difference (which was only based off one round trip), you need also include those extra 5 needed minutes. Add these together : current time taken/difference(t) plus arrival buffer = resultant value ! As per above calculations bernadette requires 16 min but since she prefers to reach exactly 5m ahead wrightfully adds another 5min making up a total requirement of 16+5 or '21'. Subtract these new combined travel & preferred advanced results /current lead time which can be calculated using values provided about waitee departure benefits hence; New Value Required To Hit Goal=(Time_Bernadette+(Desired Advance Moments))-( Time_Wayne)=(16Minutes+5Minute Advantage)-4Mintue Current Leadtime=.
