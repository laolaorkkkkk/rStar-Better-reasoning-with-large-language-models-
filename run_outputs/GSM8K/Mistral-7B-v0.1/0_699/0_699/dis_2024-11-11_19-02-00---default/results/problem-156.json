Add up these numbers to find out how many bananas you need altogether for 2 months. Total needed bananas over 2 months equals (monkeys' totals) + (gorillas' totals) + (baboons' totals). Thus: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas. Therefore, Zoo keeper would need to buy 1400 bananas as it will suffice till next purchase which can be placed anytime during or before second month ends when supply runs short because average usage without considering current stock remains less than demand thus requiring replenishment .
