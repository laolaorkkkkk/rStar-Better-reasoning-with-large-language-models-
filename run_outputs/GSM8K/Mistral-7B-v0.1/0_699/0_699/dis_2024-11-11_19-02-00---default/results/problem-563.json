According to the problem statement, 'A Pack Of Candles Costing Fifty Cents Comprises Three Wax Sticks And Twelve Fruit Loops.' Thus, we can conclude that a single candle would approximately amount to fifty cents divided by six which equals roughly 8 centimes. To find out what James spends when purchasing necessary amounts calculate price times quantity needed i.e., eighty four cents multiplied by three [a round off considering prices] this totals about twenty seven and twelve hundredth or simply $27 plus $.01 because you cannot purchase partial product due to dollar being fixed unit currency hence ten percent addition equalling .01 as change thus concluded summing up to approximate value of thirty two point zero one dollars spent.
