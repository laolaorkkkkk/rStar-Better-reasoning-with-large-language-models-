From here set up your equations based off these statements which look like this `current_total_before_dropping=intended/two*actual` Simplifying yields `(current_total+yesterday)+extra-(broken)=youth`, replace actual values into equation & solve yield formula => `((x+(x)/two)-5)*2=(x)** This simplifies down further leaving us with our desired variable x representing cookie count back then equaled solution being X=[1*(X+(X/2))-10]/(1/2): solving finally reveals old value **",
        " original desired count before adding or subtracting due errors/events like dropped cookies. That makes it \\(110 / (2*2) = 27.5\\), which isn\u2019t reasonable since you cannot have half of a cookie in this context so let us adjust our formula accordingly considering all factors : \\((current cookies+deducted ones)/(number of multiplying factor)=original amount\\). Thus solving through algebra yields \\(y=(x+(extra)+removed)/n\\)   Let y represent old cookies; n represents multiplication level pertaining back one single cycle ago (double); plus, extra denotes surplus while removed signifies deductions henceforth resulting into correct quantity being equal to counted items presently (\\(y=\\frac{count_{present}}{multiplier}=old_cookies;\\):). Applying known information results within following calculation setup thusly:\\((Count_{Present} + Removed)- Deduced= Multiplied times Old Cookies;\\)\\(=>OldCookies=(\\(Count_{Present}+Removed\u2013Deduced )\u00f7Multiplier)=\\[ ((110+5) \u2013 (-15)) \u00f7 2 ] =\\>[ \\[115 \u00d7 \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) \\] +\\[(-1\u00d7(\\frac{-1}{2}))\\] =]\u225f[\\[27.5+\\[ (.5)*(.5)]=]\\[28\\] .
