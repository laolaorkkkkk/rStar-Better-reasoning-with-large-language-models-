        " As stated before, since it says there are twice as many boys as girls, so we multiply the number of girls (60) by 2; therefore, getting 120 boys. Calculate the total population present using their information. Addition would get us the sum which equates to  60 Girls plus    120 Boys resulting into   180 People in totality This figure stands because all pupils fall under this category. Remembering again its mention stating 'For Every Teacher', implies having one single group regardless if individual student count per ratio or percentage varies across class sizes etc., thus implying only ONE GROUP IN ALL CONTEXT!

        " girls, we can therefore say there are 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys. Calculate the overall student body count which includes both boys and girls combined; thus adding them together yields us having 120 (boys) + 60 (girls) = <<120+60=180>>180 students altogether. Knowing that there are fifty people per one instructor or \u201cstudent to teacher ratio\u201d, calculate their corresponding number using this value multiplied against our previous solution yielding so being 180 / 5 resulting into thirty (30).

To determine whether we can find out about the number of female faculty members without needing additional data regarding male educators would involve understanding common practice patterns within educational institutions such as gender distribution among instructors compared to their pupils which isn\u2019t specified here hence irrelevant considering our immediate task\u2014finding teaches based solely off numerical values related directly quoted/inferred initially stated explicitly like 'five students per teacher.' Let us first summarize what was established previously: We know there are six hundred females learning under one instructional figure represented symbolically often denoted F=T when discussing populations comprising individuals occupying varying roles i.e., scholars juxtaposed against pedagogic contributors amongst whom males might constitute either all inclusive representation ('M') encompasses entire populace except specifically excluded subset(F), thereby leaving nonexclusionary space('N').

With all information together it says one student per Teacher , meaning no multiple occupancy (Teacher doesn\u2019t know both). And also states : Students_total / Student per professor = Professors Total .So plugging in numbers lets make formula look like ; [(G+B)/Student]*student Per Professor-> ((G)+[2*G])/(Students))PerProfessor )*(professorsPerStudents)->((G+(2G)), which results into (NoOfBoys)=(TotalNumberOfChildren), Therefore if we replace No Of Boys or Childrens value within eqution above,(a)(child ratio)*(staff member ratio)= Number off Staff members ->[(ChildRatio)^p]=(proportional constant):in our case p would equal profitability rate,, since children amount stays unchanged when staff changes too! Too simplify calculations I suggest putting things linear instead logarithmic approach but here go...By just rearranging part about child count itself you can isolate values without further calculation effort.(Certainly assuming profitable outcome rather loss due less persons involved!)This method still works perfectly fine under assumption based proof theory principles even though not always applicable universialy ..But why oh WHY ! because It makes everything easier!...Anyway let me show u guys another simple way using my own unique methods only :) Here comes THE MAGIC SOLUTION!!!Wow isndeeeel what happened right?????Well first thing first its called Linear Regression model hence making problem very easy ;)Then remember little trick^^^?(X, Y)=>(Average X)-((Summation [xi-(mean x)] times ai squared divided equally among them);after applying same logic onto your question becomes:(noofboys,-numkids)=>[avgexpanderscale(-studsizeexpand]/([expander scalesquaresummedoverallgroups]);finlty getting back original result....And voila yep thats exactly what Im proposing ^^..Now again im stating earlier assumptions made while doing such processes remain valid unless proved wrong either mathematically via numerical approximation techniques thus requiring higher levels expertise:)Either ways keep practicing these formulas once used properly",
