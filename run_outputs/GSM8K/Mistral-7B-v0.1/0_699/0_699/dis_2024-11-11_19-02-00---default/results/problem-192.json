Here's why it seems off track compared to other examples: Firstly, no mention about any death occurrences happens before calculating losses caused directly by cutting wood occurred within those stated 'during'. Secondly, calculations like ((50*1)^11)/7 contradict basic arithmetic principles because exponentiation comes right before division if following correct order operations standard practices would indicate multiplication first leading potentially towards higher numbers unless dividing prior which wouldn\u2019t change summed value dramatically here either way thus question itself looks confused somehow probably needs rephrasing clarification perhaps seeking addition rather subtraction regarding original stock count?.
