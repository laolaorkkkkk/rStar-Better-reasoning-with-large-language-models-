        " Next, calculate the revenue earned when selling the bags. The trader sold every bag at the price of $30, so this would imply a revenue of R = Selling Price (SP) Per Bag * Number Of Bags Sold(n). Finally, set up an equation using information about profits which states Revenues minus Cost equals Profits i.e., SP*N \u2013 COST=Profit , or R \u2013 COTX = Proft . Thus we can write our formula as follows : 30n\u2013$22x=$+&gt;profit Where \u201cn\u201d represent no.ofbagsolenquiredasinthiscasehereisthenumererofbagnosoldwhere\u201cCostCtowardsproductionanddistribution/transportationOfBagsoverPerBagbasecostmultipliedithnoofermewillcalculatedashavinggotacorrectanswerourfinalformulabecomes thus=>30n\u2013(22\u00d7No_offBags)=+(&gt;$400Thisequationwillhelpusdeterminetheunknownvalueof\u2019No_offBags\u2018whichwerequriesinceithelimittotheinformationgiveneverysinglestamentaboutthecalembasketpricesalesrevenuenetcoprofitforthissituatiionhencefromabovealigntogether\u21d230n\u221222n=$+&gt;&nbsp;&&gt;;\u2227\u2200\u2192ndefined\u21d28n=$+&gt;400Nowusingbasicarithmeticaloperationsi.e.,Division,$onbothside\u27f9n=$+&gt;400/$8\u2261\u21d2n=<<<>>><<|||>>>>>=>$$50Andalsosincequestionstatesthattraderhasselledsome bags butdidnotcompleteelyselledallthereabagssymbolicallydenoteintotalnumberOffOrbedals=totalNumberForallsodAllbagesOnWholesaleSoInFinalCaseSinceHeDidNotCompleteySellsAlldogButJustSomeFiveDogsHenceWeCanGiveTHE CORRECTANDCONTEXTUALRESULTASYPPLATFORMSILLIABELLIZETOGETTHEBREAKDOWNONDIMENSIONABLITLY ASFOLLOWSAggregationFunctionality:- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp",
        " each. This would just be 30 * n. Since we know that the difference (profit) was exactly $400, therefore  30n \u2013 22n = 400 which means 8*n=400. That works out to n=50. Hence, the Trader sold 50 bags. The answer is: 50.",
        " (let\u2019s call this \u2018x\u2018) for $20 per bag. Calculate the cost price (`CP`) which equals `price paid` or `$20\u00d7x`. Determine the transportation cost as well calculated above `(transportation per unit product \u00d7 number of units)` so we get ($2\u00d7x). Hence, calculate the net purchase amount(`NP`). Using these values; NP= CP+transport(net)=$20*X+$2*X=$22*X. As the trader managed to make a profit of $\\$$400 upon sale using equation SP \u2013 NSp > profit($\\$) & knowing Sales Price $(SP)$=$$\\$$30,$ Number sold=$(N)\\space[since\u00a0the question mentions 'all the bags']$, \\& Profit($=\\)$$400$. Substitute known value into Eqn.$[\\text{Profit}=SP\u2013NP]$:$400=(30)(x)-($22)*x$; Solving yields:`x=8/3 ~~or~~ 3.3`; Since sales cannot take fractions, let assume him sells four whole numbers i.e., Four full cartons meaning `[4]`bags only can fetch \\$400.(Hence **four**.)   The answer is: 4.. Assistant:Here I have broken down your problem stepwise explaining my logic behind calculation at every stage.\r\rNow here you go again!

        " earned by the trader after selling the full stock of wheat. Once sold out completely, this generated a sum of earnings equaling $400 (total revenue) minus overall expenditure including purchase as well as shipping which equals the said amount ($400). We can establish equations based upon these points: Let 'b' represent the quantity of boxes procured initially; subsequently Purchase_Cost+Shipping_cost=Total Cost(TC), Sales Revenue=(price of one unit)*Amount_of units Sold,(Price of One Unit)=$30 ; Total Profit=$400 ,whereas we find : TC=$(20*b)+($2/bag *B); Sale Proceeds = $(30* B)$.
