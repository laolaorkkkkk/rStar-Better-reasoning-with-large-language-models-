Convert these amounts into single units because we need our quantities consistent; one pair equals two shoes so Firefighter Frank receives 40*2=80 additional shoes across those three days while he also discards 180/2=90 shoes when thrown away on Saturday. Calculate the net gain or loss over the weekend. This results in a decrease of overall shoe count since losses outnumber additions--there was no increase during this period. Determine the ending amount using all information gathered above.
