Here i tried writing everything up neatly using text instead of equations like what most people use.. let me put my version into your required standard :) Let\u2019s solve these ratios systematically! Since Peter\u2019s locker volume (PV) relates to both Zack's (ZCV) and ultimately Timothy's lockers volume (TTV): \\( \\frac{PV}{ZCV} = 4 \\) AND also \\(\\frac{ZCV}{TTV} = 2\\) Given that \\(PV = 5 \\,in^3\\), substitute PV value while solving; hence our resulting ratio becomes \\( \\frac{5IN^3}{(TTV)(4)} = 2\\). To isolate TTV(Timothy Volume), multiply out brackets first followed by dividing through whole formula thus yielding:\\(\\frac{(2.5\\,cm\u00b3)}{1}=TTV\\).

But because Peter was exactly stated to be equal to 5 cu inch volume already; so these values hold true. Hence if peters locker equaled out to .25*zackes locker , but rather than calculating zackeis based off padritiors known value our best option would simply reverse engineer zucks=padricians(p&); hence, making paiders = (1/4)(pt+), thus pt+->paider((1/4)^(-1)), =>ptaired=(1/(1/4))which resolves int jacobinization into multiplication across reciprocal numbers :=> (1*(4)/1)=paided therefore, patercificals being equivalent to four times bigger equals timothea:(tpredicted==(pt*)x4==t)then finally substituting predicted back onto equation made previously using its parental correlation ==> pt-+><--tzake:-|<---tbigger=-|<-timidity::====Timothy-(t)--has--larger+(tlattice):>>>(pb)->>[p<<]=][[z]]:[========]=[ttiiiimaat<>]([(pt-)b]+([[]])[[)[t]{}+{}]]))(:>:)+[:];===ppeter-->zzack;;;..:=.....=Ttiimmiitttaaa(.---->)++[-lloer]:.--^-------^-............^^---------------------- ^~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~v~~ v~~~V V",

We know these facts based off math equations: zck = 1/2 ts, pkt = 1/4t, pt = 5(peter) so; using substitution let us solve for Ts (timothys locker): zck=(1/2)(Ts), pt=(1/4)(zck)=((1/4)*[(1/2)ts])->pt=.125ts=5solving for T you get .125TS=5->TS>=32.(the problem asks specifically about timethys locker being X CUBIC INCHES SO THE POINT OF THIS PROBLEM IS TO RECOGNIZE BASIC BOUNDING HOW MUCH LARGER ONE SIZE LOCKER WILL BE BY SCALE FROM YOUR GIVEN RATIOS.)

        " if Peter's locker (which measures 5) was multiplied by four you would get what amounts to equal sized compartments compared to Bob\u2019s locker. Meaning this also applies across all three lockers; so taking away one part out of these equals our result for bob\u2019s volume \u2013 5(\u22121)(\u22121)=5 but since we multiply only once here because peter already occupies space equivalent exactly same as zacks therefore dividing into halves leaves us remaining original amount intact thus yielding no change nor remainder . We can calculate the difference between timothys original locker size using following formula : Difference=Original Locker Volume-(Size Compartied Between Two Lockers)-RemainderLockerVolume=(Timithy+Peter)/3+(Bob*Patterson)*3*(LockersComparedToEachOther)wherein:(Timethy & Pedro )denotes Original Size Of Perticular Person ,while BOB denotes Remaining Space Available To Assign Further ;PATERSON represents One Eighth Partition Factor Used By This Specific Mathematician While Computationting Results !
