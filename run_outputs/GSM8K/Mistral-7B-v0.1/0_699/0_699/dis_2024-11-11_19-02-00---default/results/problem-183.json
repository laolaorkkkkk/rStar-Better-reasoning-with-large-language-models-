To find out which finishes fastest we simply add up all times together. This results in  60+57+54+51=222seconds for the entire round robin competition. Since every single member running evenly would result into a finishing time equal to just half of what was produced above , i.e., exactly 111sec, it becomes apparent both ways that if any differences can occur these deviations lie below either those made by consistently slow performances like the ones displayed here(i.e. 1st method), or inconsistent performance exhibited again through slight improvements upon already demonstrated prowess-(this is our comparison option!). Therefore without needlessly getting caught within unnecessary arithmetic calculations comparing different methods used instead let\u2019s keep things simple enough before drawing definite conclusions about said situation because such matters often require considerable thought processing capabilities among others besides mere numeracy skills too.. We shall therefore consider another approach altogether involving division rather than multiplication \u2013 dividing across variables .

        " take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. Adding all these up means Team Two finishes in (60+57+54+51) = **222** Seconds. Each member runs equally fast so multiplying it by eight yields the time it would take them if every single person ran individually which equals (**222*8=1776**). Since we know both participants finished together but no slower, any difference smaller than half our calculated amount suggests that participant actually overachieved, making us look closer into individual performance rather than comparing results as a whole unit. This tells you only about differences within your own numbers(i.e.: running different times), not relative comparison points across separate entities like yourself vs another entity/individual!

As explained above ,the best rouner takes everybody only 220 seconds to compete . Which makes our result difference simply:(Best Team Time)-(Second Best TeamTime)=220-(172 )= 48seconds better! Thus, you can say if both runs went normally without any injury while running, we could call it possible outcome :D.. ",

Thus overall we can calculate average time per member which equals (60+57+54+51)/4=55.5 sec/member, thus resulting in averaging slightly slower times when compared side by side.

This means regardless of who wins which event so long as every member across all events completes before/at 4 minutes & change into another round start , neither side gains any advantage overtime since everyone covers equal distances while keeping steady times(no matter if its 'consistently bad performance',the better group just won anyway).

Adding all those times together we get the time it took the slower school\u2019s running group \u2014 namely 60+57+54+51 seconds which comes out as equal to (221 seconds).
