Therefore, Solly might want to aim slightly above this target everyday just so as to meet or surpass the goal before time runs out which means around 7-8 pages daily.

This means while most likely not every single night Solo could realistically manage exactly ten full chapters plus partial ones based entirely off these averages because people cannot generally pick apart books into such minute amounts like fractions but theoretically speaking taking everything else being equal dividing time equally among subjects instead having him finish large segments consecutively might mean skipping entire chapters altogether otherwise leaving things until nearing deadline before rushing through them last seconds causing poor comprehension results.

        " another [ (40 \u2212 15) / 4] = 6.25 or about 6 whole pages per remaining day when rounding down since we can\u2019t divide parts of a page into four separate times. Therefore solo only needed around six extra pages daily over those three additional days according to this schedule which satisfies our second criteria too as it rounds up slightly so no partial pages would occur throughout these sessions . But if you want him exactly split out across however may be possible breaks within workdays without causing fractional reads here; It won\u2018t match reality because division works differently through timeframes \u2013 instead looking again like following scenario : Day One alone accounts most part due being halfway away yet next ones still take equal shares till finish off equally despite lesser amounts overall than first start point therefore leaving least amount available last stage regardless whatever comes afterwards unless otherwise indicated!
