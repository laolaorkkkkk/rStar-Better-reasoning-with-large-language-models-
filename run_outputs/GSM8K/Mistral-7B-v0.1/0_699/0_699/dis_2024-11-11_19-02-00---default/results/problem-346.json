Firstly, if Jenny places four into her son\u2019s lunchbox every school day (assume this as Monday through Friday), it amounts to 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 cookies per week; secondly, calculate the amount consumed daily over seven nights/days including nonweekends which totals up to 1*7= <<1*7=7>>7 cookies altogether i.e., one cookie gets shared across three people during the whole duration(a couple sharing). We subtract both numbers mentioned earlier from the original quantity stated above so we get 36-(20+7)= <<36-(20+7)=9>>9 cookies remaining hence making them available only to Jenny herself who could enjoy these extra ones later!

Using this result as start value again calculate another part which can easily help us achieve our goal statement.
