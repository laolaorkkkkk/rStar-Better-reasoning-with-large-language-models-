Finally identify time spent per segment individually using Time equals Distance over Speed formula (T=D/V), add them up! Calculate overall duration Ttotal=(First Drive+(Detour Journey)+Last Leg)!

Since I already knew John needed about .86 hour or roughly half hour rounding up if necessary just because the first part took exactly three quarters not completely third quarter when driving etc.... so let\u2019s go ahead & use decimal place value system values here... We also know everything needs calculation based upon units provided above again..here what looks most accurate using decimals such systems seems better than ones without them right?? Anyway\u2026since both calculations involve distances driven per unit times being multiplied together our best bet appears therefore rather simple enough--first find average rate over entire journey before adding any other quantities like additional trips along roadways taken! Or second method involves converting original measurement sets into equivalent numerical sums while keeping track their respective ratios within those measures themselves\u2014which could help simplify matters quite nicely indeed :) Finally though even simpler might seem appropriate instead involving several different types numbers altogether possibly requiring conversion rules specific too particular situations involved perhaps none work well compared directly against others regardless whether expressed mathematically otherwise logistically either via textual explanation only!!

However what happens here when things don\u2019t go smoothly though ? Let ' s assume something happened along those lines -- say perhaps John encountered road construction resulting again mostly due rotten timing because even without delays these constructions often happen late into nighttime during weekends especially within densely populated areas making driving quite inconvenient; thus causing extra mileage caused only through slower speeds combined impacting efficiency exponentially compared too normal expectations considering factors including vehicle type among others ; hence , additional distances also occur leading further towards completion requiring significantly longer periods necessary before reaching original target destination regardless whether using different roads instead directly connecting destinations via straight pathways although sometimes taking rather small amount off actual journeys yet greatly changing outcome altogether depending heavily largely upon nature itself ..
