        " out of 12 puppies with spots. We need first to find out what fraction this equates to overall. This means we add up both denominators (total parts): \\( \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{4}{12} \\). Simplifying \\(\\frac{4}{12}\\) into thirds it becomes simply \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), since both numerator and denumerant can be divided evenly. Therefore our equation changes to become   \\( \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{3} \\) , so next lets calculate least common multiple LCM(8*3) or just simplify fractions without calculating new one as result already equals same value . To reach comparable terms I chose bigger denominator because calculation time saved here but not limited ourselves strictly :\\( (\\frac{3}{8})(\\frac{3}{3})+\\frac{(1)(8)}{3} \\)=    \\( \\frac{9}{24}+ \\frac{8 }{24}=\\)     \\( \\frac{9+8 } {24}=\\)      \\( \\frac{17}{24}, \\\\which \\,when\\, simplified \\;is\\; approximately=\\\\{\\frac {71\\%}{100}}~or~~{{{\\overline{}}\\,\\text{approximately}\\,{{{}|\\,0{.71}}.}}{{{\\,\\!\\!\\;\\hspace{-.6em}}~\\!}}}.\\) But actually those results shouldn't differ very much regardless if you choose smaller than larger multiplier depending upon desired level accuracy...

To find per centages use this formula Percentage = Total/Part*PercentbaseToCalculateFromSo you\u2019ll get percentages based off your initial dataset or count.(In our case \u201cTotal\u201d refers tothe overall set.)Now we calculate; %puppieswithstripe=number of stripey /total number *100%=>percentagecalculationformodelogical=((percountforobjectingroup)/allobjectsintotalgroup)*100orlogically=((desiredvalue)/sumofthevalues )*100Or logically putting values as follows ; ((partoutoffamily/wholefamily))*100we want partoutoffamelyou askedwhat percentage of ALL OFF THE PUPILS HAVE STRIPES NOT JUST ON EITHER DOGWEARE WANTING TO KNOW ITINCLUDING BOTHSO ITS GIVEN THATTHERE ARE TOTAL NUMBER OF DRESSEDFORALLTHEBABYDOGS BELOWSTRIPESPUTFORTHASNUMBERFOURHOODISFour SOPUTTOGETPERCENTAGEOFFAVORSANDWHAT YOU ALREADYKNOWNCOMBINENOTONEGROUPSEE EXAMPLEBECAUSEIFONLYCONSIDERTEDONELISTFROMAPARTICULARMOMMYSONLYWILLFIGUREOUTXCHECKINGAGAINSTTHEIRMASHIONROUNDOFFTOTWOWHOLESAFTERSIMPLIFIEDDEEPENDINGUPINFORYOURINTERSETIONSLOOK ATEXAMPLEDIT IS GOOD FOR UNDERSOLONGFORMULATOINGETAWAYSWHEREVERYPOSSIBILITYISTRYINGTOSUMEDPERCENTAGESAGAINSTSUMMOFTHEVALUESPROVIDEDASSUMINGYOUNEEDYOURRATESBASEDOFFTHEWORLDDATATHIS",
        " of Brandon's dogs who have spots, therefore 3 + 4 = 7. To find what percent this is, we divide it into the denominator; dividing these numbers yields approximately .35 or about thirty-five percemt when rounded off. Therefore if out of twelve hundred (.3) ones you see twenty (.) seven\u2019s(.), only three fifths would represent sixty-two point four ninths as a fraction. As asked in the question rounding up sixteen one-hundred perecentile eighty thousand five hundred forty million nine hundred seventeen ten thousands fifty ninetenthousands. "
