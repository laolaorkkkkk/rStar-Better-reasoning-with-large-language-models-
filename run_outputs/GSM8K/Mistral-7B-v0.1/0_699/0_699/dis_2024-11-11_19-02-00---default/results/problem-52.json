        " books would equal  1/4 * 30 = <<1/4*30=7.5>>7.5 pounds removed. Uriah wants to remove overall 15 pounds but already accounted for 7.5 pounds with comics. Hence remaining weight removal needed equals   15 \u2013 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5 pounds. Since each toy removes half as much weight (i.e., 1/2 lb) compared to each comic(~0.25lb), hence per every pair i.e., one toy along with its corresponding comic together takes out approximately    1/2 + 1/4 =     3/4 or 7/12 ~ 0.583 times less than what single toy might otherwise take if alone . Therefore taking off roughly equivalent amount , namely      1/(7/12)*7.5 ~<<1/(7/12)*7.5=12.85>>12.85 worth of items can result into same reduction effect which means removing nearly equally split numbers ie;        -> around [tex]\\\\frac{12}{2}[/tex]= 6 individual pairs ====->around[tex]\\\\frac{7+6\u00d72}{2}\\\\approx\\\\frac{19}{2}=9.5 \\\\ \\Rightarrow roundup[latex]\\\\to[/gray]{10}pairs => approx[latex][right]{10 }[/gray]items !!

Therefore, he doesn\u2019t need to remove any toys since the question was not about reducing additional weight but achieving exactly 15 pounds reduction via removal of already defined items i.e.,comics alone here being removed completely which happens when quantity gets tripled upon doubling while maintaining individual item weights constant thereby resulting into tripling overall required mass(in context) also hence no addition or subtraction becomes necessary per se nor applicable as such within asked scope keeping intact original 'item counts unaltered except intended quantities adjustable', implying zero requirement thus leading us to conclude urinalyse towards absolute certainty against ambiguity; hence none!
