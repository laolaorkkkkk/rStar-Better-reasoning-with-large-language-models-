We know that if something costs X dollars currently, charging it Y percent less than its current cost implies reducing its new expected payment by multiplying X*(Y*/100). Applied here, replacing the variables yields $(140*(10/-100)). Reducing everything results into ($140*.(-0.1)), or $-14 since a negative sign simply indicates subtraction while performing mathematical multiplication.
