Finally let us calculate Bob\u2019s Weight since it follows mathematical operations other than substitution/algebraic functions applied earlier , B (Weight Bob)= Twice As Much Of [Mark vs Susan] or simply put \u2018B = D*[Susan].

Substitute Susans(i.e., 130) into this formula thus finding out Bob\u2019s current weight ((2*130)=260 pounds), add all these calculated values together i.e., find sum=(Mark+Susan+Bob) or ,sum=(150+130+260)=  540 . Find Mean value using mean equation,(mean value of data set = total sum/number of items )or divide computed Sum above through Numerical count(no.ofitems;N))/(150+130+260)/3 hence calculating Mean Value equals to   540/3 =    180 pounds This implies the group consisting of persons named Brian, Sarah & Joshua holds approximate collective body mass index equaling roughly 180 pound units when examining statistics around such variables among human populations thereby representing typical averages found across most general samples taken nationwide within United States census regions during late spring periods coinciding annually alongside calendar markings denoting first quarter transitions following solstices throughout latter half years stretch extending unto subsequent third quarters leading ultimately towards mid winter seasonal shifts occurring respectively post yearly equinoxes aligned corresponding respective hemispheric positions relative sunlit hours prevailingly experienced under observable atmospheres comprising significant air densities characterizing temperate climate zones commonplace globally whilst simultaneously maintaining consistent proximity against earth orbitals inclined axes yielding rotational velocity rates exhibited exclusively beneath standardized timeframes utilizes specifically measured intervals based upon international standards applying uniform scientific methodologies consistently employed irrespective locale considerations wherever applicable due purely technical reasons necessitating exact numerical figures despite otherwise arbitrary nomenclature specific regional applications implying variable temporal measures dependent entirely up sole individual preferences none universally enforced neither mandated legally enforceable either administratively established nor legislatively imposed requirements permitting alternative flexibility allowing users discretionary choice amongst various alternate customizable options designed accordingly accommodating personal needs without affecting overall functionality albeit still adhering strictly compliant protocol specified therefore conforming seamlessly fitting perfectly integrated harmoniously integrating effortless fluidly adaptably coherent unimpeded",
        " This means Susan would weigh (Mark's Weight) - 20=  150-(20)= 130 Pounds). It also tells us that Bob weighs twice what Susan does so ,(Bob\u2019s Weight ) = [Twice]=(2)(the amount Sarah weighs) which equals (Weight of Bob = 2 x Satan\u2019s Weight = 2\u00d7130 poundes= 260) . To find this average you need add all three together divide by 3 because it says \u201caverage.\u201d Total Sum([Total sum]/number of items )So ((150+130+260)/3 )...and that comes out to [(NominalSum/NumberOfItems)] equaling about ~ (Money divided evenly among people), or\u2026((Amount_spent/people)) Calculate everything within brackets first ($540/(3 People)). You get $(Divide NumeratorByDenominator). Therefore your average mark per person was around fifty six point seven million seventeen thousand one hundred eighty four cents \u2026Or say like ..56 dollar nineteen cent...And here I use approximation notation....because if not everyone could afford EXACTLY half kilograms i just round down.....or up depending who spending habits happen to be when payments taken care off! ...To simplify things further remember : Each pen costs $$ $. That makes me earn % %. But since these pens already cost something without buying them ;-) let our price become percentages instead :) Our original calculation might seem confusing especially considering my initial explanation above but once again look back into math class & make sure those calculations work themselves properly ;) Just go through every part using paper; draw diagrams while solving problems yourself --this helps reduce mistakes too ^^ Here goes another fun idea --> try making graphs showing different amounts spent vs times purchased etc.; compare results later comparing numbers obtained w/o graphical method versus analytically computed ones :-D YAY MATH!!!!! Also don\u2018t forget basic rules such formulae used everywhere across diverse fields including science&engineering areas besides finance applications thus creating new insights worldwide thanks guys (:~ Thanks folks !! Keep enjoying learning mathematics although sometimes daunting however always valuable nonetheless ;)",
        " subtracting 20 from Mark\u2019s weight equals Susan\u2019s weight (150 \u2013 20). It means that Susan weighs 130 pounds . Find out if Boo weighs double what Susan does or not ? Since it was mentioned here that bob weighs twice as heavy as Susan meaning Bob weighed half of what Swozzy plus what BOB already weighs before getting heavier , let us denote the initial amount which bobs used to weigh(before gaining extra) this way; Say X   To find our exact value Let us use algebra : according to information presented above ;      Based off these relationships one can write down such set expression like so       Solving said formula yields your result    Therefore knowing all variables except for BOB you would see something like below once calculation performed..

        " of Bob. It says that Bob weighs twice as much as Susan; thus multiply Sarah\u2019s weight (130) times 2 equals  260 pounds. Find out what their combined weight totals up to when you add all three people together \u2013 this equates to 150 plus 130 plus 260 equaling 540 pounds altogether. To figure our average value divide your combined sum by the quantity of numbers which means take 540 divided by 3 resulting into approximately thirty six point six seven or about halfway through twenty eight thousand one hundred sixty four if rounded off using standard round rules making sure not undervalues nor overestimates the real result .",
        " 130 pounds \u00d7 2 = 260 pounds. Next calculate combined weight. Add up all three people's weights; this equals 150 pounds (Mark) + 130 pounds (Susan) + 260 pounds (Bob). Together these amount to 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Finally divide this sum over the count of individuals which amounts to 540 divided by 3 people so that makes it approximately equal to 180 pounds per person when rounded off correctly. To avoid rounding errors ensure precision through keeping track till one decimal place. Hence the correct result comes out to be exactly like below! Therefore, '",
        " therefore 150 (Mark\u2019s) \u2013 20 (the difference specified in problem statement), resulting into Susan being 130 lb heavy. Together all three people add up to  150 (Mark) + 130(Susan )+ 40 (Bob). That comes out to 320lb when together divided by 3 equals about ~107lbs..  The answer is: 107.",
        " 130 pounds. Thus Bob together weighs (130+40) = 170 pounds. To get the arithmetic mean you add up all weights so ((150)+(130)+(170))/3=450/3 = 150 pounds; thus the group\u2019s average bodyweight was one hundred fifty pounds per individual. ",
        " (M) = 150; Susan(P)=130;Bob(B)= 40. To find out what our mean value would like, add all three values together /number of samples). Our equation looks like this ((M+ P+ B)/N= AVG), substituting numbers it becomes [(150 pound + 130 lb + 40lb)]/3 . Solving these equations yields  320/3 , or about 106.67lbs.. ",
        " Susan also weighs (Mark\u2019s weight) - 20 = 150 \u2013 20=130 pounds; finally when you add it all up, we get Mike\u2019s weight plus Susan\u2019s weight plus Bob\u2019s weight divided by three. Or ((Mike\u2019s weight)+(Bob\u2019sweight))/(numberoftwores)=((150+40)/3). That comes out to ((150+40)/3)=<<(150+40)/3>>130/3 . "
