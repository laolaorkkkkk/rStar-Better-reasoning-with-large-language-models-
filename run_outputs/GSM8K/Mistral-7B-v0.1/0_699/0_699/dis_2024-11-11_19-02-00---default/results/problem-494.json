Three others follow upon these four including last or smallest being sixth layer whose length needs adding onto what came above...so let us work backward!

Therefore; first four individuals who make up the base layer would likely add close together ~ 17.6ft (assuming perfect alignment, could vary slightly depending on whether you count their exact positions/width), next three layers adding approx... 13.2 ft, and lastly another 4.4ft making us come back down our starting point essentially meaning no overall change considering this scenario involves people standing directly upon other people without creating any new structures causing discrepancies regarding actual 'height'.

Hence, adding all together first equals [256+192+192] inches which amounts to 640\u201d. Converting this measurement to feet; since each foot contains twelve inches, simply dividing the entire length yields approximately ~53.33 feet as the combined height of our human structure or 'pyramid'. Therefore, when expressed within whole numbers rather than decimals/fractional formulations ('feet') rounded off equates roughly about fifty three. However note though while precision varies according specific contextual interpretations & individual analytical judgments \u2013 standard academic normative practice tends toward using exactness over approximated estimation especially under mathematical disciplinary boundaries emphasizing accuracy alongside thorough comprehension thus justification offered herein might arguably not wholly align exactlywith such principles but aiming for practical balance among both preciseness requirements alongside accessibility levels accommodation factors inherent within certain real life scenario applications.
