Since gaining one inch per year translates roughly equivalent to .08 feet/year; compute time taken thus , about (.8/.08) ~= around six additional years till reaching desired stature. Therefore, It would take him approximately sixty months before becoming eligible based off this approximation assuming consistent annual incremental increase remains constant without exceedance due to other factors like genetics etc.. To summarize: ((Four Feet Requirement Height)/(Growth Rate))*(One Year Conversion)=((4)+(.5)-Yards)*(1 Years Per Yard)= Approximately Six More Months Needed!.

Knowing that he grows about 2 inches per year calculate the time taken as follows : Taking half of these remaining units would provide us . As we know one complete increment of growth takes place every year , dividing our resultant requirement(approximately) i.e., around eight months here indicates less than a single calendar cycle hence round off implies till next coming birthday! Our target can only become achievable post reaching doubled up increments thus implying minimum period stays aligned alongwith natural annual cycles..
