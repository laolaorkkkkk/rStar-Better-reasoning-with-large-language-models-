        " less than those without masks (x) i.e., N=4*3-5 = 2, meaning twice fewer compared to non-wearers due to no-mask violation count. Condition three states thrice their counts get kickout too means n+N+D=T , here D represents rest or other causes numbers involved . Hence; T=(3)+(n)-((2))+(3*(d)=), thus putting value of all known factors/conditions into place & solving using algebraic manipulation results yields : Resting ones comes up around approx.. 1 unit which translates loosely towards human units representing groups etc rather one individual ; this can only mean negligible figures below integer boundaries including zero itself would make sense logically therefore answering approximately closest whole digit nearest minimum decimal representation available lies within 'zero'.

        " And according to condition 3, this time three times the amount was kicked out due to violent actions; which amounts to 3 (times). That totals up our numbers so far being  3+7+21=31. To find out the number kicked out because of another reason or causes, you deduct these ones off against original quantity :i.e., Total Quantity\u2013Summit quantities ;or     =>   50-(31)=->      -->         --><-->          ->       19 ..This means nineteen individuals faced banishment pertaining no listed activity..

        " non compliant persons but reduced (lessened) by five i.e., seven less than twelve which makes sixteen plus three or seventeen customers. And finally according to Condition 3 stating \u201cThree time XYZ,\u201d these refers to tripled amount if one person isn\u2019t allowed entry because their violent behavior towards any good item sold inside the mall like clothes etc so this translates into multiplying them by ten hence making thirty something extra points deducted off our already summed up figures resulting us moving backward again subtracting instead adding thus putting everything backwards once before coming forward twice all while leaving me without having calculated anything yet. Finally concluding when put together mathematically; first take care about numbers representing totals such sums/counts only meaning actual quantities matter most despite being named otherwise especially within situations involving human actions taking place among themselves regardless numerical values attached alongside either individual behaviors including both positive ones pertaining lawfully approved intentions AND negative counterparts signifying criminal activities whatsoever whenever attempting computational resolution due lack proper representation ensuring precise calculations leading eventually toward desired result fulfillment process completed satisfying requisite parameters throughout entire operation until completion reached achieving overall success scenario successfully attained state thereby avoidance mistakes occurrence likelihood greatly decreased probability increases certainty gain substantial benefits advantage gained ultimately determining best course taken actionable steps following provided directive instructions accordingly achieved outcome intended purpose accomplished fully positively effectively efficiently satisfactorily precisely accurately confidently conclusive clearly comprehensibly understandably definitively decided upon suitability meeting specific need requirements thoroughly carefully deliberate thoughtful consideration detailed contemplation profound reflectivity thoroughness exactitude rigorous adherence strictly observed principles upheld standards meticulously maintained high quality performance consistently delivered dependable reliable trustworthy confidence earned respect received commendations appreciated thanks acknowledged grateful humbler expressed sincere appreciative sentiment genuine gratitude wholeheartedly sincerely thankful glad happy cheerful joyous ecstatic delight satisfied content pleased peace full filled bliss serene calm tranquility loveliness happiness euphoria unparalleled pleasure supreme satisfaction ultimate nirvana utmost exaltation pinnacle zenith apogee epicenter nucleus center core essence distillate quintessential spirit vitality energy force vibrational frequency rhythm dance harmony unity love affinity connection heart bond soul union souls interconnected consciousness existence awareness mind body senses organs",
