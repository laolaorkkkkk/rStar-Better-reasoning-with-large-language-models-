Therefore, Frances\u2019 portion amounts to ($9*12)/3=$36*(the middle term canceling out leaving just the one third fraction component), while this accounts as the last remainder means its value subtracted both initial values therefore resulting into:$1200-$480-$360.=Remaining Cash=Skyrals contribution=Total Amount Invested $- Removed Portions$. Hence it can simply calculate as being worth(or representing):$(totalamount)-((dylansamt)+(franzasamt))$, meaning $(skylarsamt)=($1200$-($480$-($360))$). Resultantly yielding :$(skylarsamt)$=(remainder amount)==$(left over funds)(cash not spent)$.
