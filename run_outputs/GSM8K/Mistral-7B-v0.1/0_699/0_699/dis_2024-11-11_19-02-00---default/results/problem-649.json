        " Initially it said this amount would become seven times larger than first time (which means multiplying these six thousand) so we need to get like initially only divided into those seventeen thousands; i.e., divide them back to their original values before multiplication which happens when you simply extract single digit numbers out of hundreds \u2013 ten or hundredth place positions etc.; resulting result becomes equal twice its value prior since doubling equals adding up again what used previously!

Substitute known values into this equation: Initial_Likes = Total Likes - Extra New Likes; Therefore we get Final Likes= 420000+ 20000 ; Which makes it equal to  440000 .
