As such one possible solution would imply Dividing both sides into FIRST term which simplifies down to either X=Factor/(Numerator). We therefore find our result here using first terms since numerators cancel out resulting CLOSEST approximation value being roughly 0.85 times lower than N denominator but slightly higher due round off error & decimal places used throughout calculations hence why multiplying these values together yields something somewhat closer still BUT not identical nor exactly like expected output because when dealing wth decimals sometimes slight shifts occur making exact matches impossible yet overall results very close if followed correctly through process carefully enough also check math behind computations made ensure correctness before drawing conclusions!
