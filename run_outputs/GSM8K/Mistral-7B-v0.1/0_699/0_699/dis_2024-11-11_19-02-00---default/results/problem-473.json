Benny observed the original length of the shark as well which was stated as ten feet. Thus we need to find out what proportion these twenty four inches occupy when compared against its parent's overall eight foot plus twelve inch height . This calculation can also use this approach : ((remorsal_length*number_of_sharks )/initial_height)*100 To get our numerical value you simply replace variables like below .Remorsals Length=six Remoras Number=two Initial Height=(ten)=SharkHeightAnd apply calculator steps , first perform multiply operation(i).((( six times Two))/( Ten)).Then divide result(ii.)with variable three.(iii.).Finally complete your computation by multiplying obtained outcome(iv.)for factor Four,(four).Now place above values into formula shown underneath;For clarification I shall display my computations using simple numbers rather than those mentioned earlier ; i:(eight)(two)=sixteen ii.:divide previous obtaining twelveteenththird::multiplypreviousresulttimesonehundred Finally applying calculations results indicate Sixpointtwenty percent As such Final ",
