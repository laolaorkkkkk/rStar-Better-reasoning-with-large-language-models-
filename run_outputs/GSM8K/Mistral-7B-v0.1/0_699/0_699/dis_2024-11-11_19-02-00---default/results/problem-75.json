Overall though because math doesn\u2018t account perfectly well for human estimation errors here approximations probably make even bigger mistakes possible--and especially when dealing quantities small enough! Here approximation seems far better option anyway.* I estimate roughly close due mainly thanks having very different sizes within individual pyramids but still need both smaller ones adding quite noticeably too despite mostly being pretty tiny compared relative massiveness overall structures themselves possess generally speaking anyhow ; however using actual numbers actually provides excellent consistency throughout process although admittedly would lead possibly unintentional roundness issues if attempted carelessly instead doing precisely calculations every single step along way.(Also note carefully nothing mentioned anything directly concerning exact fractional representation beyond merely saying \u201cnear\u201d.)
