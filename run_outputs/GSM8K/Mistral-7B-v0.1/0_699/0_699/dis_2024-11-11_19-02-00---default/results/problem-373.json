        " functional items equals 40/100 (percentage represented as decimal) multiplied by $400000 which calculates to $160,000 . Finally, subtract this value ($160,000 ) from the initial purchase price of ($ 400000). Hence, when you return these defective products, your expenditure only amounts to $(400000 \u2013  160000), or $240000 , therefore the correct answer would be \u201c$240000\u201d.",
        " To find this value, we first need to determine the average price per piece of equipment using division operation based on provided data. Equipment costs / Total number of items = Price/Item or ($400000) /\\([Total_number\\_of\\_items]\\), We don\u2019t know \\([Total_number\\_of_Items]\\). But we can rewrite our equations like so ([nonfunctional_equipments]/[total_eq])=0.4;(x)/($400000)=1/(units equivalent);we could get rid of units equivalence variable thus getting just values needed..i.e,[Non Functional equps]=[$40000*(.4)]=[$16000];To check whether these numbers make sense mathematically you divide original investment dollar figure by percentage fraction used above which results into no negative figures suggesting correctness.(~$40000/$4)[No Negative Figure](This makes perfect mathematical logic since spending never goes DOWN when comparing fractions .We still require only one item count here\u2026since both variables represent same quantity i replced mine \u2026here [[notional]]unitcount[[fromoriginalcalcationabove ]][=$40000/(~.$4)\\end{array}\\begin{aligned} & \\$400000=(.\\overline{.4})(\\text { Number } [\\underline{\\mathbf{Equipped}}]+[\\text { NonFunctional}] )\\n\\\\ &\\frac{$400,\\!000}{.4}=~\\underline{{\\mathbf{Number Of Items}}} $.&\\quad=\\infty \\\\ &&& \\approx 100 ,\\!\\!( ~is pretty close anyway !!) \\\\ & (\\text { Substitute actual summed up eq count })\\\\[color(grey)\\hspace{-7ex}[!=]{}$400,000\\,/\\,$0.4&= 100\\,\\,,|\\,(few dec places)$\\\\[align]*(&$)&&&$$\\%_\\text{(Faulty)}=.4=&%%_{Not Faulty}.~~=%{:._.}$$+.$$\\%_{\\text{Functional}}=.~60^{\\circ}(={.}_{Better than Half})\\huge-\\;&.~\\Big(-(%.4)&=($.)(-.4)$$=-(.*,.6)\\,+\\;&~~~~~~~~~~~~---+$(.*,.6))$",
        " items equals 60/1.6 times or approximately  375[*thousands*/thousand]. To find out what percentage this constitutes compared against their original investment; you divide these 375 thousands ($375000) over your initial spending i.e.,$400000 and multiply up by one hundred%. Doing so leads us directly into our equation :(375K/$400K)*100%= %. From here we see clearly that just ~93 percent was actually working properly once replacements were made.(Due note than I rounded decimal places throughout). This therefore makes sense because if 40% were bad ,then logically less would still work! "
