Three extra balls needing counting due to unexpected event during Jonathan's routine (two received back into possession while another went missing), can help us solve this task.

        " the talent performance which took place four weeks later (at the beginning). Hence we can assume this means 4 increments during these 4 weeks. Since Joe adds one extra juggling object per week, over those 4 weeks, Jones would accumulate another 4 objects resulting into him being able to juggle 3 original ones plus 4 newly acquired ones equaling to 7 juggling items or balls. Determine whether any balls dropped due to mistake while performing onstage impact our initial count. According to question statement, out of all initially performed seven items/balls; upon committing error only two get captured back instead of dropping onto empty space unlike usually observed cases considering usual norma of counting remaining items kept intact post such mishap scenario.

Instead find out how many additional sets of balls (each equaling the original count) Jose managed to add over those four weeks which represent improvement due to practice time passing. According to the question, Josh adds 1 new set/ball per week hence it would mean addition can occur only thrice i.e., because initially, Joe already began with initial staring configuration(i.e., Juggling 3 Balls).
