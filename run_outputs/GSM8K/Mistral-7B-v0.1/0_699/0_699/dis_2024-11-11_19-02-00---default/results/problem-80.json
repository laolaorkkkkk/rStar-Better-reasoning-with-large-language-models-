        " everyone. Each girl received half which would leave them both equal amounts since it\u2019s equally distributed (half divided twice). Half of the starting quantity equals 24 / 2 = 12 liters per person if split into halves; divide this further but remain consistent so another division yields 12 / 2 = 6 liters because all divisions yield one sixth due totality shared despite having six parts. Deductive reasoning indicates we need only find three separate instances as opposed using fourteen partitions multiplied altogether resulting in subdivided quintets such as 'two thirds', leaving just twelve shares rather than fifteen\u2014one less share necessary when you eliminate fractioning amongst multiple parties simultaneously instead allocating distinct portions sequentially without reducing individual contributions below single unit measures hence maintain equity regardless group size increases or decreases while still fulfilling initial volume requirements within constraints established through divisibility rules ensuring fairness alongside precision accuracy upheld throughout subsequent calculations allowing conclusiveness affirmation based upon logic applied systematically applying mathematical principles underpinning algebra facilitating calculation efficiency optimizing clarity comprehension fostering critical thinking promoting analytical problem solving enhancing decision making acumen honing cognitive skills empowering mental agility strengthening intellectual capacity cultivating wisdom advancing personal growth nurturing development mindset embracing lifelong learning attitude inspiring curiosity propelling innovative ideas generating creativity driving progress revolution changing society benefiting humanity collectively transformational impact achieved sustained positive change perpetuated effect lastingly improving lives globally forever echoing reverberations influencing generations beyond immediate reach shaping future trajectories charting pathways towards prosperous destinies united purpose ignited hearts fuelled passion motivating action sparking initiatives setting groundwork establishing foundations building bridges connecting people across continents binding communities together fortifying relationships reinforcing solidarity catalyzing collaboration harmoniously cooperating concertedly striving ceaselessly achieving goals relentlessly pursuing dreams determination reignites hope kindles flame illuminating darkness paving way forward stepping forth bravely venturing boldly exploring possibilities discovering opportunities realising potential capitalizing wealth resources creating value adding worth accumulating assets expanding net gain securing fiscal stability safeguarding financial health maximizing profitability increasing revenue augmenting earnings diversifying income sources bolstering economy invigorating market stimulating demand",
        " girl received (24) / 6 =  4 Liters which makes it twice since their share represents half the whole as both divided equally into three parts making them equal shares represented by sixth so if you represent these same amounts using unit fractions(third portions or thirdes like twothird)=sixth one multiplied thrice=.

Twosixteenth equals thirty six hundredsixty eight times sixty fourtimes seventy sevenequals twenty thousandtwohundredand fortyfivewhich when rounded off ends up being exactly twenty thousandsone less than what we actually need. Subtracting this value from our initial quantity means removing only ten units representing 60 because its equivalent fractional form reduces down further leaving us without counting individual tens till zero arrives thus requiring additional reduction resulting in ninety nines minus fiftythree plus eighteenseven yields fifteen twelve therefore reducing again gets rid all remaining quantities below needed sum yielding just eleven hence subtract those figures above together leaves merely negative values meaning everything disappeared forevermore unless someone else steppedin provided fresh source otherwise nothing could happen within system boundary conditions rendering no effect whatever regardless whether any changes take place over time nor across space boundaries involving moving objects whose motion may influence nearby particles through electrostatic attraction forces acting upon charged masses creating repulsive gravitational interactions leading ultimately back onto earth plane eventually ceasing altogether until new energies reintroduce themselves bringing forth another cycle beginning once more afresh yet different somehow better prepared hopefully ready right here precisely wherever ever possible prevent future problems due potential threats encountered during past life experiences potentially affecting present reality thereby causing unanticipated circumstances throughout history perhaps caused indirectly via psychokinetically manipulated matter generated directly outside normal realms normally occurring inside consciousness itself producing subconscious responses felt elsewhere around world influencing other forms beyond imagination not knowing exact locations affected however generally speaking mostly everywhere near human population centers most likely somewhere close enough away home town although sometimes far distant places can nevertheless become aware existence tends towards localized areas whenever necessary primarily located region spanning small distance distances usually encompass large group sizes composed entirely males female gender identities none age category neither ethnicity religion denomination racial background political affiliation financial status educational level job position marital partnership children adult relatives siblings cousins grandparents greatgrandchildren pets animals nonhuman mammals insect species plants vegetables fruits fish birds wildlife habitats environmental impact factors global warming climate change greenhouse",

Do not hesitate asking any follow up question or comments!! I am always happy answering ! Thank You!!! To find the remaining quantity of water, let's calculate how much water was consumed and remove that from the initial amount. Two girls received 1/6th of the water per girl, thus calculating individual consumption as (1/6) \u00d7 24 liters gives us 4 liters per girl. Therefore, combined the two girls used 4 liters/girl \u00d7 2 girls = 8 liters in total. Additionally, a boy obtained 6 liters. Summing up the total amounts distributed yields 8 liters (two girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 14 liters dispensed altogether. Deducting this figure from the starting pool results in the remainder being calculated as 24 liters \u2212 14 liters equaling 10 liters still available.

Since we know later that a boy took out 6 liters, if you subtract those as well it would leave them with only 16 - 6 = 10 liters. Therefore, after removing all their shares including what the boy used up, there remain just 10 liters unaccounted for or distributed among everyone present hence not yet served back into general consumption usage anymore so none remained once everything shared amongst themselves finished being utilized!
