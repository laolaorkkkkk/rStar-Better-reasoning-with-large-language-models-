Let's break it down correctly: One pen costs as much as a pencil plus an eraser, so if a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, together they cost $1.50. That means one pen costs $1.50 because a pen costs as much as the sum of those two items. To find out how much 8 pens would cost, simply multiply the cost of one pen by 8.
