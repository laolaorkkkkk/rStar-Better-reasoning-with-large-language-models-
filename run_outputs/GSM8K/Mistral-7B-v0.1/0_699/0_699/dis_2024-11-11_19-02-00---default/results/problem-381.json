We can use these numbers also when comparing distances over different amounts of time just like algebra uses variables but instead using units to replace them i.e change around what values you put first vs last while multiplying etc.. Using substitution allows us compare quantities directly without having convert back all those measurements...and finally let s see if I understand everything correctly before proceeding further :| But yeah its quite clear here cause both formulas used only involve multiplication! Which essentially undoes addition hence reducing complexity slightly :) And besides making life easier whenever dealing specifically regarding physical displacements ;] Anyway moving forward lets tackle your question itself ..So since cho wantsa know who covered greater distance within respective durations , therefore needsnt worry abt finding individual totals separately cuz diff speeds imply varying duration lengths overall still ending up being similar ends wld get comparative analysis needed along side knowing exact differences!!
