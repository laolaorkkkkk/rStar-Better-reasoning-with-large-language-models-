Since 60% of those who make it are women (and therefore 40% are not), we calculate what remains as follows:- Out of all remaining surfers(75) about half or rounded up would likely include both sexes equally since no specific ratio was provided.. About one quarter might thus consist roughly similar representation based off percentages.- We\u2019d estimate around ((0.5^2)*0.25*100)=6 boys made it out.(Note though numbers rounding rules apply).
