And furthermore, considering practical aspects such implied within daily realities \u2013 no half tables exist because everyone understandably prefers intact items instead but splits them whenever needed therefore ruling our fractional output off entirely ; Henceforth concluded finally -- Our last definitive figure stands rightly positioning itself proudly among those acceptable round numbers indicating complete sets only without any remnants remainsthree",
