To know exactly how long Peter needs to workout means we first need to calculate how much time he worked out during both days (Monday & Sunday). His activity levels recorded showed; Sarah walked 4 steps per minute on Wednesday which lasted half as long as when Kevin was practicing yoga .Kevin spent four times longer than it took Jane doing jumping jacks,who jogged nonstop while maintaining average speed equal to three miles per hour until midnight. Given this information , determine if Claire could complete walking home faster compared to Alex who ran across town covering twenty eight kilometers without stopping, traveling over one hundred meters every second consistently for hours before arriving promptly past sunset.. What would their respective journeys look like based solely upon distance covered ? We can solve the puzzle with the given information but let\u2019s simplify things since not all statements provided directly contribute towards determining relative speeds or distances related to individual characters mentioned such as Claire and Alex respectively.:   Step 1 : First disregard irrelevant info about people other than claire and alice unless asked specifically regarding them ;    Step 2 : Translate relevant measurements into common units assuming standard measurement conversion rates for better clarity \u2013 convert Alice's running speed 'over one hundred meters per sec' approximately equates around km/h [Distance(m)x Time(sec)/Time^2(secs)=Speed], so roughly ~36kmph -> About here our comparison ends because no further detail involves specific duration etc., however considering usual practice keeping approximate results isn\u2019t detrimental!

Since the problem states that Peter Wants TO EXERCISE FOR \u201cTWICE THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE DID ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY COMBINED\u201d, rather than simply doing exactly \"twice\" past activities, one can infer certain details based upon human behavioral patterns associated particularly within fitness circles\u2026 It could imply \u2018an attempt towards maintaining consistency while ensuring progressive development through longer workout periods.\u2019 This aligns well enough even without overlapping daily routines \u2013 meaning though all activity happened consecutively (on Sun->Mon->Tue), let alone being directly linked causatively! And so applying such reasoning leads us back toward our initial conclusion:-    Firstly understand clearly\u2013there isn\u2019t explicit mention stating every morning/evening pair representing unique intervals dedicated solely onto distinct exercises only happening individually either way around etc.(i.e no split routine scenarios mentioned anywhere); nor specificity regarding frequency variations across different types / areas targeted during respective timing slots.; But seeing otherwise\u2014practicing similarities shared regardless whether engaging single type versus multiple throughout varying temporal frames suggests potential habitual inclinings aiming broader physical adaptation objectives instead purely quantitative expansion per unit cycle spent:)     Subsequently deduce logically \u2014consider usual normative behaviour amongst regular athletic trainers who regularly interchange various forms whilst also employ diverse training methods encompassing differient calibrated intensity levels adjustable accordingly tailored precisely suited individualized requirements hence personal best achievements achieved continuously optimized effectively cumulatively overall)..So keeping everything simple yet",

Thus since Saturday isn\u2019t included here because we only consider till Friday (which equals four workouts), halfway through Thursday needs to occur i.e., during Tuesday morning or evening session too(as not all sessions can be considered). It means about three quarters into one single session; so if you divide it evenly amongst hours spent exercising throughout these individual events respectively , say 'a fraction'(of course dependent upon when daily routine began) out every fourth cycle/exercise hour within them altogether but excluding last ones unless needed extra due unforeseen circumstances etc.(in most cases least likely). Assuming equal distribution across those remaining times without making adjustments whatsoever might yield around somewhere near something approximate like roughly roundupwards approximations based off average human behaviour patterns observed thus far . Hence approximately adding up close enough approximation as mentioned earlier results :approximately approx..roughly summing totalling together said estimated ranges accordingly gets us almost exactly onto actual desired outcome expectancy parameters ;i ..thus leading towards optimal effectiveness levels being achieved while maintaining productivity potential maximums achievable under such specific constraint limitations dictated via personal goals pursued alongside professional growth objectives seeking fulfillment thereby providing ultimate satisfaction beyond mere material gains hence increasing likelihood success rates significantly whilst ensuring complete wellbeing preservation simultaneously!
