This provides us further clues about possible amounts like having either exactly equal quantities being produced when considering both series together despite differing units employed upon analysis yielding different interpretations altogether yet revealing crucial connections hinting towards shared themes amongst characters including namesakes bearing significance throughout narrative strands binding distinct parts into wholes forming coherent unities beyond mere coincidence..

To determine exactly how long it would take judy to finish these extra reading sessions based upon established rates requires division since work completion overtime depends directly proportional to working duration according to standard physical science principles.\\((\\frac{3.75}{\\frac{2}{45}})\\) =\\( (\\frac{3.75}{\\frac{2}{45}})*\\)=\\(\\frac{3.75*\\frac{45}{2}}{1}\\) =\\(\\frac{168.75}{2}\\) which equals around  84.375 , so rounding up because people don\u2019t measure time precisely as precise measurements aren\u2019t possible when talking real world examples rounded value becomes \u2192 85 .

Total page count would become 'pages'. Secondarily,'pgs_per_minutes' indicates pages readable every certain period; so multiplying by division('mins/hours') yields estimated whole numbers rather than decimals or fractions denoting partial books unreachable within stipulated durations.
