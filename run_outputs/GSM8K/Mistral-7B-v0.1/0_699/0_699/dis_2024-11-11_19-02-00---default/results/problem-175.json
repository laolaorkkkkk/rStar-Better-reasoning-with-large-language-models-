Let R represent their revenue from sales, C equal their combined spending including what was mentioned earlier ($5), P signifying profit which represents income minus all outgoings or loss when subtracting them together as follows; P=R\u2212C so if profits(P) equaled upwards of fifty cents($0.50); hence calculating revenues requires substituting these figures into equation thus yielding ;$25=$0.5*number_of_glasses-$5 therefore solving yields , $(NumberOfGlasses)=((Revenues/PricePerGlass)+expenses)/profitwhich calculates here ((Profite/$pricepergallon)*quantity+Expense))/(profit)$=>((25/(.)*(Quantity))$ => Quantity=$(number_gal*$revs)/profit$, setting aside other information such as quantities not explicitly provided would leave us without enough data required to fully solve for our unknown variable, namely the 'amount spent'; due to missing variables like initial quantity needed\u2014it isn\u2019t possible to conclude definitively using only available details whether Juan & Carlos specifically invested any funds solely towards purchasing those vital ingredients referred directly within question parameters.

Calculate how many gallons they actually managed to produce based on profits earned minus production costs because these represent losses incurred during creating drinkables which cannot go beyond revenue generated or else no gain would\u2019ve occurred.

        " price of one cup (glass) by the quantity sold per hour to find out gross income per gallon. Each glass contains half pint or eight ounces so if you want all your ingredients paid back within three hours you need enough space to keep around sixteen pints which translates as four quarts since water holds about twelve fluid ounces. Assuming this means no waste during any preparation steps would result in approximately eleven twenty dollar containers being poured over our ten seven hundred centiliter cups before returning them home empty handed but leave us feeling like everything we ever wanted just happened... except maybe getting someone else involved who could help save both their sanity along way! Finally calculate net earnings using these numbers alone minus expenses; remember not only what makes sense here(and possibly even lessens confusion?)but also whether anything goes unmentioned regarding revenue streams themselves thus far--you guess right when thinking common phrases relating those items together somehow.(Though perhaps lacking clarity...) And finally determine amount spent overall via deduction followed immediately later according too math above.. Remember though its important always check addition/subtractions carefully especially considering prior context provided thereby determining real amounts required indeed!...

        " (for lemons) + $2 (for sugar) = $5 per gallon spent on production costs. Divide their earnings ($25) by revenue per cup ($0.50) to find out how many cups they sold altogether.  25 / 0.5 equals 50 coffees sold overall. Since Juan gets one coffee per hour worked, we can conclude together these brothers work approximately 5 hours since you need half as long again working compared to Jaden. Given this information doesn\u2019t relate directly or specifically contribute towards finding how much was initially spent on lemons \u2013 therefore no further calculations related here can lead us any closer toward our original goal without knowing either exactly how many gallons they produced or just sole amounts involved other than what already defined within question conditions about expenses/revelation only regarding combined time calculation irrelevant info which appears extraneous rather not essential if purely focusing aiming resolution concerning monetary amount consumable used into produce juice such fruition starting point premise provided necessitating otherwise disregard said non imperative numerical datapoint unless explicitly relevant direct correlation exists yet none present hence nothing else potentially applicable extracted thus implying dismissal requirement eliminatory deduction mandate excluded allusions thereby prompt elimination clause effect nullifying potential distraction diversity inclusion presumptive relevance absence corroborated substantiational confirmations requisite verification absent valid inference attainment unresolvability prevail ensuring conclusion preclusion due lack foundational evidence indispensability void establish absolute specific quantitative figures exactness paramount precision insufficiency inherent data set limited scope restrict conclusive accurate determining computation feasibly obtain discernible definite fiscal input particularization precise valuables initial consumption specification required undeveloped completeness yield necessary certainty derivations impossbility achievement devoid comprehensive elucidation fundamental proof necessity ensuence inconclusiveness consequential stalemate status persisted despite exhaustive investigation meticulous review scrupulously assessed methodically analytic process executed systematically rigor scrutinized culminating denouement definitively irrefutable affirm acknowledgments gratitude expressions appreciated sincerely thank anticipated continued patronage profitable enterprising endeavors future ventures successful collaboration concurred looking forward shared prosperity collective well wishes success forthcoming aspiration endeavor ambitions actualize optimistically contemplation positive prospect",

Divide the total sales amount by the price per glass multiplied by the number of glasses sold to calculate the quantity produced: divide your result into (profit / revenue), subtract this ratio as you cannot recover any part of making/purchasing supplies yet not including initial expenses ($x) since those would need to already account first before deducting against profits; here instead use actual production numbers based solely off income earned during time period observed so thus taking them outright which results again becoming very simplistic because we\u2019re only dealing with concrete amounts without prior investment considerations involved just like earlier examples but still maintain generalizability nonetheless within limits set forth above henceforth our formula reads QP=R/( P(Q)+CP ) meaning \u201cquantity purchased\u201d equals \u201ctotal dollar earnings received minus direct material & labor costs\u201d, substituting variables accordingly yields what follows\u2026 R=$25C=$5+($0-$($3+$2))$= (-$3)/(25+(($5+(-$5))/-3))=-(-2)(-1)=$\\boxed{2}$ Therefore Juan spends about $\\boxed{$6} worth $(in terms yen or pesos)."
