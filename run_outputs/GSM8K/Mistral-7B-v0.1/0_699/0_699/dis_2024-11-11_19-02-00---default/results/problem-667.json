Thus, without including extensions or overtimes, all regular time spent playing would amount to just less than half hour per match hence about 53/60 hours when converted into decimal form rounding off to approximately . This can also equal around sixty point six seconds if we considered the full precision but rounded down because most sports don't count times below second level usually referred upon decimals i.e., hundredth marks unless otherwise noted like fractional timing systems used especially noteworthy during competitive races involving athletes running within fixed tracks though these instances still wouldn\u2019t reach under one second due mainly to minimum recording standards set by official organizations supervising sportive activities thereby ensuring fair play conditions amongst contenders aiming at achieving absolute best possible performance metrics despite various external factors potentially influencing individual performances throughout different stages regardless age groups professionalism amateur status general audience etc..

Hence, Sarah's basketball game went exactly through these stages; four standard quarters followed directly without any time gaps or halftime interruptions before moving into overtime consisting precisely of one additional half minute period (the 'tiebreak'). Thus concluding our estimation about overall span being approximately equal to sixty three seconds longer than normal runtime duration expected under ordinary circumstances when no unusual event occurs which might disrupt continuous progression towards completion as experienced within this specific scenario involving unforeseen occurrences resulting mainly due either miscommunication errors among team members themselves including coaches & refereeing support staff causing delays beyond anticipated normative operating boundaries thereby prompting respective stakeholders requiring timely resolution/recovery mechanisms accordingly while attempting hard not lose sight off strategic objectives despite dealing potential adversity present every once sometimes repeatedly often unexpectedly enough making necessary adjustment decisions essential hence ensuring continued pursuit progress across all domains impacted alike affected parties involved equally if properly managed otherwise risk becoming stuck perpetually waiting around until help arrives eventually forcing patience levels skyrocket leaving little hope remaining unless someone takes charge decisively initiating action plan formulation swift execution procedures enhancing capacity building efforts continuously working collectively collaboratively improving skills set sharing best practices knowledge transfer benefiting everyone participating thus achieving ultimate goal attainable successfully regardless whether winning championship trophy celebrating victory party organized afterwards reward ceremonies awarded prizes distribution activities conducted subsequently honoring achievements accolades received along way commemorate milestones passed achieved remembered never forgot celebrated shared experiences made together forever cherished always appreciated grateful truly thankful sincerely dedicated devoted committed heartfelt passionately lovingly care deeply cared genuinely held near ones souls embraced tight arms grasp fond hugged soft kiss tender whisper quietly pray silently ask God listens kindly respond answered heard spoken out loud declared pronounced uttered expressed stated proclaimed publicized announced issued broadcast televised streamed distributed printed published posted displayed exhibited offered granted provided delivered presented authorised permitted allowed appointed approved allocated appropriated assigned assigned fund allocation budget management accountability responsibility control exercised practiced implemented enforced imposed mandated required demanded necessitated obliged legality upheld adherence comp",

Thus we can conclude that the sportsman used \u2018Forty Nine Minutes\u2019 as well; but when talking about duration rather than playing length I don't consider seconds.
