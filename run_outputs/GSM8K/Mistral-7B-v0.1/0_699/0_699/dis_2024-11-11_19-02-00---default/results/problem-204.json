Again regarding acquisition another detail; \u2018two bags of red...\u2019 implies we add twelve since twenty multiplied twice equates forty eight but subtract half which signifies removing four would result ten being equal again sixty. Conclude by determining the summative total amount or all types of individual items together considering starting point as well adding rest obtained over time. Summing up these figures yields ((initial)+((blue)*per_bag)+extra((red)* per_bag)) -> (32+(six*nine)+twice*(sixties minus fours)). Evaluation leads us concluding totals reach seventy one. As clarified earlier it isn't asking quantity related subdivisions nor distributional quantities among specific groups hence collective counts suffices conclusion rendering summary accordingly thus answering Seventy One Pens!",

Similarly, since every red pen bag includes 6 pens, this implies she acquired 2 x 6=12 red pens during purchase. Therefore, determine the total amount of all pens Janet currently possesses which results from adding together any remaining quantity of previous items (green or yellow) along those obtained through recent transactions like buying new ones. Consequently, our solution comes out as follows: Start point was when Janet initially possessed only greens & yellows i.e., 32 pens followed up by additional purchases worth exactly 54+12 equaling precisely 66.

Similarly, calculate the new quantities for the remaining purchases; Red Pens: since there are 2 bags containing 'each' six pins makes it 2*6= 12 additionals thus bringing up our summing point yet again making consideration merely upon numerical growth i.e., not color specific accumulations Hence Total Number Of New Bought Colored Pens Calculation Is As Following : Blue Pen Summation Being Precedence & Last Item Considerance Point To Be Called Initial Quantity , Subsequent Additions Are Done Simply Mathematical Adding Up Given Values And No Intermediate Color Specific Cumulation At This Stage Though One May Note These Items Do Constitute All Other Colors Except Green Since Only Requested Info Was Mentioned Elsewhere Such Condition Does Not Require Sequel Logic Extensions Thus Providing ",
