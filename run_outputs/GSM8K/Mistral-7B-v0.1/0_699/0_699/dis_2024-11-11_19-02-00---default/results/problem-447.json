We subtract those jointly gained 36 points so now Joey leads again but this time less than earlier because Marcy caught up; hence it would actually show as negative numbers if you simply look at scoring alone since adding positive values effectively reduces lead difference when combined against other gains like Jouan\u2019s individual increase vs Mary Cynthia'. But instead understanding game contextually can also mean analyzing margins not just point differences\u2014for instance considering percentages or rates could possibly imply different comparative measures which aren't explicitly stated here though often relevant yet omitted sometimes within raw data presentations without needless complications causing further misunderstanding about real situations etc..
