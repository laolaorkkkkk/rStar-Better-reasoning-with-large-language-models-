Altogether, thus, they would have needed to contribute ($90+$90)=$180 towards the payment costs associated with this joint event.. This means the cost was distributed equally among them because both spent exactly same amount $(($90)/(2))$. Therefore it becomes clear why you cannot say one person or another contributed most toward what happened even though only one activity directly involved him/her -- people who choose activities which involve others also need to bear half of any expenses linked upwards to those choices! As such let us assume without loss sighting into context presented here\u2026if someone asked me 'who pays mostly?' ,my first instinctual reaction might actually appear counterintuitive but correct according mathematical principle applied above : BOTH!!!, since whatever happens within group dynamics during social interaction always necessitates compensation not just isolated occurrences like single ride instance described earlier...And if we go deeper than surface mathematics looking underneath logic principles governing shared resources usage amongst individuals \u2013 all variables considered ; ultimately come back squarely facing basic fact revealed previously already highlighted briefly .

Since Benjy spends 5 hours using this Banana Boat Raft (with its value decreasing overtime), thus making our calculation simple as such: Time_Benjies_in_the_boat(hr) X Cost_per_hour($). Therefore, simply put :  5 hr x $18/hr= <<5*18=90>>$90 . Hence your resultant cost becomes: Total Cost $(TotalCost)= CarosTcost+(BenzitCusto); Substituting values into the above equation yields: ($90)+$(90)=Total Payment made by both parties together ; Adding them up finally results:$90+$90=$<<90+90=180>>$180 , meaning Carlos paid $90 while Benji spent all those hard saved earnings too..

Please continue working through your explanation starting over again like initially provided here... :( You seem to confuse matters & mess up consistency along w/a couple o changes made midway :o(. Let me show you exactly how correct analysis would proceed: Each individual cost calculation goes something like thus:- Suppose our budget allows no expenditure higher than X cash units.- At first glance suppose ROW_YOGIELLA takes T seconds (=TSS)... Since water flows S SPM via rowboat OR floaty=rowbuoy or whatever:(SPS)= SpeedPaceSpeed=\"x\"-->then its duration(time span)(duration(t))=(distance traveled)/speed PACE+STEAM=[length]/(velocity)*[number of times speed adjustments happen]= [WALKED distance]/average([running][walking])*NumberOfStepsPerFoot.(Each stride being ~X feet long--let us call such measurement UnitFPS).. Hence , let say:[water flow](FlowRate)=Velocity*(concentration),(which yields N cubic ft./sec since H20 molecular velocity sLARGE OVER CONCENTRATION); hence unit SIZE^n term decays away into nothingness!!!So lets backtrack just yet further:-->(UnitVolumeForTimeSpan)_RowBoat=. Water Flow rate .

        " Therefore, 3 hours times $30 equals $90. Next, calculate what it costs Benji who used the raft for 5 hours; thus using his rate which is less than Carlos', i.e., $18/hour multiplied against 5 (his usage time), this results in $18*5= $90 as well ($90). Finally, add up both amounts spent by them \u2013 since they both paid equally despite spending different sums initially, the common cost here would simply mean adding these amounts together hence resulting into $90+$90=$180 all together. To sum up your solution statement might read like follows :\"Considering Carols expense was made via his purchase over three continuous intervals equaling thirty units whereas Benjis transaction occurred across several instances making him spend only nineteen out every twenty possible unit exchanges, if we collectively account for those resources utilized within specified bounds our joint accumulation reaches eighteeny zeroes.\" Hence,\"the combined payment totals one hundred eighty USD\".

        ". Next, let\u2019s calculate what Benji paid for using the Banana Boat Raft; it costs him $18/hour times for usage duration which equals (5 \u00d7 $18) or $(5 \\times 18). Let\u2019s find out \u2013 as we know multiplying means adding multiple same values such like here, you multiply both numerator ($18) and denominator (time span i.e., 5 hours), thus getting your resultant value $$(18 \\times 5) = \\$90$. Once again reiterating above results, Carlos needs only spend about \"$90\" whereas if comparing them sidewise clearly shows us similar outcome when evaluating prices against time frame used.\" Therefore , overall expenditure would just sum up together since this question asks 'how much', not individually spent, but jointly combined sums. Hence answering straightaway \u2014$$(90+90)$$=$$\\boxed{\\$180}. Thankfully keeping simplicity intact within these complexities ensures better understanding! Don't forget those essential steps while handling any arithmetic problem involving fractions & decimals.. ;) . Great job sticking through despite minor mishaps along way :-D ",
        " x 3 = $90 over three hours. Benji wants to use the banana boat which costs $18 per hour but only needs it for half as long (to make its cost equal), or for one point six seven hours ($18/hour). This results in $18*1.67=$30 rounding off upward since time doesn\u2019t really stop during this transaction thus making us spend more than what we initially planned while playing water games!

        " we need multiply this time with price per every use (hour) so it will cost him 18*5=<<18*5=90>>90$ . Next deal is about carlos who spent 3 hours using the canoe which costs us... Canoe rate here tells as well if you remember its equals just like all other rates 30$. As said before benjis ride was equaly long than carlos one let calculate same way again ... We simply take amount Carlosed wanted tot spend multiplied times also length(hours used). Like following formula !!! Multiply Amount By Length Of Riding : DollarRate!..

        " (Price) \u00d7 (Time). Substituting numbers into this equation; it turns out that Benji spent $18 per hour times 5 hours equals equal benjis_spent which amounts to ($(18)(5)=$90 ). Thus Bens cost was $90 . We use these same steps as above for carlos , calculating price\u00d7time=carols paid amounting to $((30)(3)$which comes up to $(90)$thus Carols payment totaled $$90$. Finally all you need to calculate is to sum both costs together ; so adding them yields us our finale result : $$\\boxed{Benson's Spending+Carden's \\Spending}$$$$(90)+($(90)$)$$equals $\\boxed{$180}.$ To solve ",

        " a canoe, which typically refers to paddling type watercraft similar to what one would use while engaging in activities like kiteboarding or wake surfing. Since we know these types often involve personal equipment such as boards or single outboards (jetski), it might fit within either category depending specifically on context not provided here\u2014but let\u2019s assume no shared expense scenarios since neither explicitly mentions using another form together; otherwise if jointly involved multiple options could arise including potential multiples counts due overlapping usage times causing confusion about split vs unsplit costs unless clearly stated differently than mentioned initially regarding sole proprietors splitting resources despite initial setup suggesting individual ownership responsibility per activity preferences dictated elsewhere absent further information clarifying unity amongst participant groups sharing resource allocation duties etc).

        " Multiply this rate times the number of hours (in decimal form). To calculate what happened when he spent half as long using it (or just one fourth time), we need first convert the original cost into its fractional equivalent which would involve finding out our starting point or value i.e., Cost($)Cost(hours)=Rate$(/hour)$ Rate=(x$)/H= y$\\frac{y}{\\frac{1}{4}H}$Multiplying fractions requires us multiply across numerator denominators resulting $\\frac{(x\\times \\frac{1}{4}) }{H}=\\frac{(\\frac{y}{4}}{H}=Rate$. But since H changes nothing because the same amount was used beforehand; only Y changed thus simplifying further results yielding $Rate=\\frac{\\frac{y}{4}} {H}$. Using these steps correctly finds accurate results hence ensuring proper conversion process within mathematical practices thereby concluding accuracy required solution yields Value:$Rate=\\frac{\\frac{90^\\circ } {6}}{\\frac{{2^o }} {8}}$.Using properties mentioned earlier therefore simplify accordingly obtains resultant values,$rate=\\frac{90}{6}\\div\\frac{{2^o } }{8}$,$$RATE =\\frac{90}{6}\\cdot\\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} \\\\ {{2^{o} }} \\\\ \\end{array}} \\right)$$Ultimately solving fully through correct order operation sequence following standard mathematic principles ultimately resolves initial complex function accurately equipping precise numerical resolution reflective true statement outcome.$Final "
