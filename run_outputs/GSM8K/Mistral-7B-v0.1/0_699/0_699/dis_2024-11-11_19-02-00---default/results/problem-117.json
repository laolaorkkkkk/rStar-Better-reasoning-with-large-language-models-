        " each of three children which makes it 2*3=6 pairs of shoe altogether. Each pair costs him US$60 so six would equal (US)$60(pair)*6pairs=$360 overall. The answer is: 360.",
        " This means he buys 2*3=6 pairs of shoes in all. Each pair costs $60 so together six would sum up to (6)($60)=$360 . The answer is: 360.",

        " shoes per child (shoes_per_child), therefore calculate this as follows:   shoe_price * shoes_per_child = price paid; substituting into equation above we get:    Price Paid= $60/pair*2(pairs)*each child -> so it becomes::$60x2x3=$360 . Finally multiply together the values found below which equals:$360.
