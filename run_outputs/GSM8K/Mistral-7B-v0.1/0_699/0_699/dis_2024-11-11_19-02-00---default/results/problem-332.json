As per your previous experiences when calculating volume using edge lengths etc., it would make sense to use different functions inside `solver_cube()` method(either standalone within this module or imported), so we can keep our code modular and maintainable. Here's what I am thinking about including:- Total surface area calculation (`surfaceArea`): Considering no edges shared between shades separately.- Volume calculation (`volume`): Edge*Edge*Edge. But remember; cubes consist entirely of unit squares. Hence, while writing down equations involving multiple dimensions such as Area, Surface Area or Volumes always consider units like sqaure feet `(ft^2)`, square inches `(inch^2)` and volumes being represented typically as Cubic Feet `(cu ft)`. We also often represent smaller values relative quantities proportionately rather than absolute quantity say if one caster was used less compared to others perhaps because its size isn't consistent throughout.<|end_of_document|> Implementing various functionalities based upon requirements makes sure modules stay coherent i.e self contained yet interconnected allowing reusability across projects thereby saving resources especially time debugging process ensuring efficient workload management overall team collaboration experience improves significantly making project development cycle smoother promoting professional growth furthermore fostering creativity enhancing problem solving abilities thus facilitating innovative technological breakthrough achievements ultimately benefiting business operations bottom line profit margins shareholder returns long term viability sustainability success competitive advantage global position strategic decision makings impact world economy geopolitical relations human rights ethics social justice equality equity opportunities inclusion diverse communities inclusive education lifelong learning continuous improvement perpetual motion concept infinite possibilities boundless potential limit",

While all problems indeed require basic arithmetic skills such as addition and subtraction \u2013 fundamental operations covered extensively during elementary education \u2013 what sets apart certain difficulties lies chiefly in dealing effectively with compounded actions necessitating systematic application of several operations successively rather than isolationist single numerical manipulation involving simple arithmetical computations alone. Consequently when evaluating difficulty levels among various scenarios, understanding distinctive patterns becomes paramount including variations like multi-layer operation sequences versus isolated action considerations alongside factors relatable both quantitatively through numerous variables engaged simultaneously along qualitative dimensions manifesting via nuanced real life implications linked inherently toward enhanced mental exertions demanded thereby making said instances technically 'more complicated.'

        " taking 40% of 220 which means (40/100) \u00d7 220 equals 88. Out of these 88 ruined castles, since we know only half of these are without guides or manned staff; therefore dividing this figure would mean that roughly 44 remain unmanned (half). Thus, approximately there are about 44 'unmanned' castle sites remaining within Scotland\u2019s borders outright considering rounding off numbers based on natural data collection practices common among such demographics as tourism related facilities including lodges, resort accommodations etc., thus concluding our numerical computation task here pertaining directly into cultural geography aspects while being strictly aligned not just visually but also statistically representative too due particularly significant contextual relevance towards broader socio-economic constructivist theories emphasizing historical preservation alongside modernized interpretative efforts designed specifically aimed toward visitor enjoyment experience enhancements whilst concurrently encourages deeper appreciation cultivated through knowledge transmission initiatives often leveraged via educational interactive experiences amongst other novelty attractions potentially developed strategies promoting sustainable utilization levels achieved thereby ensuring long term maintenance requirements can feasibly continue supported infrastructural upgrades needed during regular periods necessitating rejuvenation actions undertaken periodically throughout said timeframes respectively according predetermined intervals established accordingly depending upon various unique environmental factors influenced variables typically associated primarily surrounding seasonal climatic fluctuation conditions dictating specific adjustments applicable particular localities especially those situated along coastlines frequently found generally subject varying extremes characterizations usually attributable typical regional weather patterns predominantly driven largely meteorological dynamics governing direct impact forces experienced distinct areas defined essentially broad general terms relative average temperatures influencing prevailing currents altering atmospheric pressure systems affecting air masses displacement trends generating overall wind circulation movement directions hence causing subsequent disturbances resulting changes global climate behavior observed globally encompass all parts earth spheres regardless location types locations worldwide inclusively covering diverse sectors industry segments business opportunities financial activities economic growth prospect potential implications innovation advancement investment decisions government policies societal shifts future planning aspirations individual perspectives collective consciousness progress ideals ethical principles morality values belief structures traditions customary laws ordinances regulations statutes legal rights judicial procedures court proceedings fair trials hearing sessions testimony depos",
        " This results into \\( \\frac{40}{100} \\times 220 = 88 \\) ruined castles. Of these 88 castles, only half are unmanned or empty which means we multiply this result by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). That leads us finally to calculate resulting value as follows: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 88 = 44\\) such abandoned castle buildings exist throughout all of Scotland; hence the conclusion can confidently suggest if one wants to visit such historically significant monuments while exploring beautiful Scottish landscapes!

Half of these ruinous castle stands empty or 'unmanned', which means divide this result above by two; it results as 88 / 2 = 44 manned/ruined abandoned ones remain present across entire nation within Scottish borders.
