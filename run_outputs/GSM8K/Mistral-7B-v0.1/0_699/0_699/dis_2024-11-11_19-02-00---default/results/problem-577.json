You come across information indicating Van Gogh\u2019s painting \u201cStarry Night\u201d was valued according to records released this quarterly financial report as being thrice higher than Picasso's work titled \"Guernica\". Additionally, Monet's series called 'Water Lilies', which includes multiple works, fetches double when compared cumulatively to Picasso's single piece auction value mentioned above but also accounts for individual sales surpassing those of both Starry Night and Guernica separately due to its limited edition release. Provide a summary encapsulating these valuations alongside historical pricing context without divulging actual numbers or percentages while maintaining chronological artwork sequence based upon creation timeframes. Certainly! To craft a comprehensive yet nuanced narrative around the valuations of seminal masterpieces such as Vincent van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" (*painted circa 1889), Pablo Picasso's \"Guernica\" (*created in 1937) and Claude Monet's water lilies series(*completed late into life starting roughly since early 20th century until just before death, capped off sometime past midcentury)*\u2014all recognized globally through separate exhibition phases, we focus herein on abstract values reflective of comparative standing following recent significant market activity sans explicit numerical references tied exclusively to modern transactions occurring annually nor relative percentage differences against peers.

Hence averaging would thus require calculating means separately against individual timestamps mentioned earlier while taking note into account only counting data points relevant solely relative their specific timeframe without disregarding any particular timestamp unless otherwise stated thereby facilitating appropriate comparisons leading towards better insights based upon contextual relevance rather than purely statistical representations alone .
