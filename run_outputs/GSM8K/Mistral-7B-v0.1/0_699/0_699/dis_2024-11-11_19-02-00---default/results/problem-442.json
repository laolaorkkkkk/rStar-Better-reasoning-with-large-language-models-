Thus you multiply time spent using your body(the third dimension), which equals weightlifting, squats or other strength exercises; therefore duration becomes irrelevant if this component remains constant over several training sessions.\" Explain why different types of physical activities affect metabolic rates differently. Physical activity increases energy expenditure above rest levels through various mechanisms. Each type of exercise engages specific muscle groups and cardiovascular systems thereby leading to diverse impacts on basal metabolic rate (BMR). Weight lifting primarily targets skeletal muscles causing them to increase in size and contractility, enhancing their ability to oxidize nutrients especially during short bursts of intense effort known as 'high intensity interval'. This process results in elevated thermogenesis locally around the working muscles increasing overall BMR post-exercise due to heightened demand on aerobic and anaerobic pathways even after cessation of strenuous movement \u2013 called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). Furthermore structured routines focusing repetitively upon certain muscular segments rather than broad systematic motion may optimize hypertrophic potential hence influencing daily caloric burn via increased mitochondrial density within those fibers responsible chiefly producing adenosine triphosphate molecules providing cell fuel essential throughout prolonged sedentary phases including nighttime fasting/diet break cycles commonly observed among individuals subjecting themselves frequently without proper recovery intervals interspersed amongst workout regimens ensuring sustained adaptation against deleterious effects such compromised efficiency linked consequently reduced performance gains achievable absent regular stimulus adaptations aligned closely proportional frequency & volume characteristics inherent core modality selection considerations while accounting variable factors like age related degenerative processes contributing towards declining functional capacity otherwise noted respectively corresponding diminished capability manifest across lifetime spectrum ranging well beyond typically specified threshold values prescribed initially underpinning initial theoretical formulations established based preliminary observations yield informatics subsequently validating methodology thus supporting contemporary empirically informed assertions substantiating evidence derived supportive research findings confirm congruence hypothesis previously presented maintain scientific community consensus standards whilst encouraging continued exploration endeavors seeking deeper understanding regarding underlying physiological principles governing relationships intricacies encountered navigational challenges",
