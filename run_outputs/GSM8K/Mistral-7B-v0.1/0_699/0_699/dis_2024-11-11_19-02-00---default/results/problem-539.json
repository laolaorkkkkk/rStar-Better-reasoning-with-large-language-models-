As per your question regarding adding \u2018a further amount representing exactly one quarter towards such expense i..e making sure everything adds back upto original figure once included.\u2019 With numbers above mentioned here all seems clear hence calculating percentage based upon previously derived totals using formula Percentage Amount Calculation=(Total Particular Expenditure/ Original Bill Total)(100). Here putting values accordingly:-((($25+$25*C$[tip]+(or+total)+original=)?)=$\\frac{(\\$50+\\$(x\\times \\$50)/2)}{\\$100} \\times$$[\\text{\\$} . ?]$ This simplifies down to $\\displaystyle =\\left (\\dfrac {\\$ {50}+\\$ \\middle\\lfloor{(50\\%)\\cdot  50}\\right)}{1}\\right)$$=\\left(\\dfrac {100}{1}\\right)$ or simply X equals Fifty dollars ($\\$ 50$) , rightfully rounding off anything beyond cents isn\u2019t required due its absence till date either way just rememberin gto add \u2019another FIFTY FOR THE TIP BUT ONLY UPTO THE CENT SYMBOL TOGETHER USIN GBOTH PARTIAL COMPONENT S AND %AMT WITH IT !Now apply said calculation onto provided inputs :**To clarify calculations shown earlier->Given Valuables:$A=$DinnerCost ($50),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\begin{array}{|rclcrcc|@{ }c}%PartialExpenses_{wife}= &amp;{}&\\mathrm{\\dfrac{[part]\\,of \\,each }{amount \\,spent}}{\\tiny{''}}\\\\=&\\\\&=&\\qquad\\,\\,\\quad{{'\\,'}(\\,\\,)} &\\mbox{ }\\!\\!\\bullet\\!\\!\\mathrm{{\\scriptsize\\{half \\;since\\;we\\;split\\;evenually}}}\\\\&=&&~\\overbrace{\\mathrm{.}{\\phantom{-}\\,\\small{\\vdots}}\\,\\textrm{$\\large{:}$}\\,~}^{\\mathrm{$}.${} \\\\ &=}& {}&\\frac{{\\Large \\fbox{\\hfill\\phantom{{\\rule[-.25em]{0ex}{0ex}}}",
        " it was divided equally among two people we divide the amount ($50) into half (total number). This means my portion before adding tips would also be worth $(50/2)=$25 as well.. But since you want your piece bigger because of better service than yours spouse received let us calculate what percentage increase this comes out to.... Here\u2019s how... Let p represent the original payment plus a 20 percent tip. That equals $p=($25)+(($25*1)*(.2))$P=$30.$You ended up being responsible foir covering $\\frac{\\text{your part}}{\\text{the total}}=\\frac{$30}{($30+)$25}=\\boxed{60}$ or $$\\begin{array}{|r|} \\hline ",
        " assume you also want this fair division so it becomes easy (or not). You could say since splitting equally makes no sense here let\u2019s just count your percentage ($x) as what your portion of the cost was plus extra because without knowing all costs other variables affect amount owed; therefore calculating using percentages alone would lead us astray when determining exact figures per person involved due mainly being arbitrary rather than accurately representing actual totals combined during initial discussion phase above mentioned regarding payment allocations among parties involved within specific date range specified below based off personal preferences agreed upon ahead time prior too sharing information about such plans currently taking place online amongst ourselves right away via phone calls made yesterday night over course several weeks ago while never having met one another before ever speaking directly despite contact already established well beyond mere acquaintanceship level according strictly limited purpose related solely focused primarily directed exclusively towards business needs otherwise nothing else aside factual matters discussed thus far throughout conversation occurring immediately following previous exchange involving detailed negotiating process undertaken simultaneously completed subsequent transaction execution happening concurrent situation developing presently underway amidst multiple scenarios emerging daily worldwide resulting global economic downturn caused largely stemming unforeseen event triggered unexpected consequence brought forth sooner earlier timeline whenever circumstances arise outside expected norm deviating greatly deviation standard practice contrary usual operation conducted usually employed every single industry profession including health care providers dealing wi...
