As such our closest estimate based upon givens provided remains at seventeen instead however i still feel uncomfortable doing so since no clear justification was offered within context regarding why certain calculations might take precedence against others even as logical thinking suggests only numerical figures bear relevance when solving math puzzles thus leaving doubt lingering around possible calculation errors stemming possibly both indirectly or directly influenced factors unknown yet present amongst solution derivations leading ultimately towards misinterpretation resulting error making my confidence waver slightly overall despite seeming perfectly valid without obvious reason presented henceforth..",
