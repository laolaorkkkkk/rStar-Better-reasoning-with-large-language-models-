Calculate the value of x based on these equations. This represents the minimum amount needed so Sandra won\u2019t receive complaints about empty spots. Since we know half was kept aside during inventory management, double that before finally multiplying them together. You can solve the problem without explicitly writing out formulas or mathematical notation since you need contextual understanding over math terminologies like 'ratio', etc., here instead consider words representation i.e 'multiples'. Given the details let us decipher following way . Firstly its mentioned Red Roses=MultiplierXWhite Carnations therefore X*Y; Second info states Pink Calli Lilies(PCK)=Multipler*(Half quantity of Y); Substituting values ,since Multiplier=(PCK)/((half Y)) & thus substituting back ; We get Equation : X=[[(Four Times White flowers)*Total Flowers]+([Two Fifth][One HalfofAll]*totalflowers+[Thirty Twicethe Whites]-(TenthWhitenotes)]/(twofifth)); Further solving yields Numerator part equals TotalFlowers hence Solving further yield required Quantity ",
