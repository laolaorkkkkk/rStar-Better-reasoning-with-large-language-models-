As such, when these three teachers joined up; only half could not come i.e., already counted one person among those absent or cannot attend thus remaining students amounting into  26 minus another student making him go home adding back our missing teacher bringing us closer to eventual headcount.

Finally add up three teachers who joined as substitutes during poor transport condition to get the overall number of individuals sung in the concert. This adds another set bringing our group size to roughly 17+3= 20 participants singing together under unfavorable circumstance on stage.
