Your answers above led me down another road instead what matters here simply knowing these specific amounts before doing any arithmetic calculations like division nor multiplications etc.--thats enough info alone without involving anything complex otherwise everything becomes confusing again...if b stands tall among other numerical values provided earlier why bother finding additional terms irrelevant towards obtaining accurate results!!!
