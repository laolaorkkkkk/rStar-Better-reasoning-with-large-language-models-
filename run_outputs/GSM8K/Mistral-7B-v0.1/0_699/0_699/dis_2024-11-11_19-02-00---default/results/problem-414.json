Firstly, you can work out exactly what 30% (the markdown) would look like; multiplying .3 times twenty dollars equals six point three or just about six dollars ($$6). This means all four shirts come up around sixty four hundred eighty cents altogether when purchased individually during sale weekends.(Near enough rounded figure calculated according to available options.)

Considering both factors here, let\u2019s assume it provides about twenty percent savings instead since lesser than usual rates seem fair considering the customer getting them directly through their own efforts. Hence, if saving twenty percent means spending only eighty per cent what was otherwise required i.e., ($x* .2)/($.2) = $.8 / (.2)=$X; Solving leads us towards finding X= 1, thus implying all these four items initially worth twelve would altogether get sold for Eight Dollars or precisely Three Dollar Two Cents post application mentioned above!
