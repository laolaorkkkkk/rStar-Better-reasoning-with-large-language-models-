Thus let\u2019s look at what \u201cper\u201d implies here \u2014 `density` ! It means average or typical values instead of exact ones . Therefore all such word pairs used interchangeably within statements mean their inverse; as when something like ``one foot tall'' , meaning very close proximity but NOT equal height among individuals so long its approximate size ; while another example could refer specifically towards measurement itself! Hence why 'foot=inch': because feet cannot vary significantly across people whilst still remaining essentially accurate due large variances caused naturally during growth processes.(Pg 6). When measuring distance/size using words such 'acres', you usually want them not too far apart nor extremely spread out either otherwise calculations based upon your known quantities won\u00b4t hold true anymore-- just imagine trying calculate volume without knowing distances first... Or perhaps better yet try visualizing things geometrically before getting into any math problems.. That way even simple tasks become easier thanks geometry being fundamental element behind most sciences including physics theories etc.). Last thing though regarding weight units~ if someone said kilogram(kg); doesn\u00b4t imply exactly certain quantity ie mass since kg can change depending both location plus environment temperature conditions affecting material expansion thus alter weights slightly accordingly.... And similarly grams(g)= mL : water expanded under pressure decreases density leading lesser force exertion needed holding glass down vs liquid form thereby making small changes significant overall.....
