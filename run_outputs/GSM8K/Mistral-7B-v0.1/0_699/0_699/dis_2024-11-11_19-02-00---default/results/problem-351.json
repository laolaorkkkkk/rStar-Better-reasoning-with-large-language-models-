This resulted in having leftover stock once she learned about student need; hence when answering your original question I subtracted these initial purchase numbers immediately because it influenced whether or not additional purchases would be required thus producing surplus inventory/leftovers following fulfillment of demand(in this case). But logically speaking if you want me explain further regarding why certain decisions might lead into unnecessary excessive resource consumption like time spent considering unneeded resources here i am presenting them next... First off consider perhaps being proactive rather than reactive \u2013 maybe instead making larger amounts initially so no sudden surprises arise during execution phases etc., also thinking long term could yield savings compared cost benefit analysis versus going smaller quantities up front even though costs per unit may vary accordingly too!
