Explain mathematically any inferences needed but ensure you haven\u2019t changed variables used within those inference steps already present outside initial condition interpretation. Here it goes: John takes one cooking class which runs four times per week over six weeks; thus this amounts to \\( \\text{Total Sessions} = 4 \\, (\\times\\,6) \\) weeks. Each session lasts 2 hours so we multiply our previous result by these hours \\(\\text{(}=4\\ast6=24\\; \\text{' sessions')}\\) Since each hour equates to half an extra lesson(as 'hour equals twice miniature'), hence  24hours become \\( 24/2 = 12\\) Extra Lessons .
