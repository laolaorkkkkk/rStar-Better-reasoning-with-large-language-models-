Divide this result into equal parts as instructed within the question i.e., dividing it amongst 4 friends resultingly; Here we would divide the residual amount per friend sharing them : Each Friend receives 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 lollipops ",
        " the amount which it was distributed among others. Total distributed : (total_lollipops) \u2212 (kept_lollipops). Hence this becomes ((25\u22125)/4)=4 or three decimal points i.e., approximately .75 , so roughly around seven halves as whole numbers can not convey fractions accurately, hence let\u2019s say round down here because you cant share part of single unit if we consider these toy like objects ; however note one individual may get fewer than another since sharing items doesn't always result into equal parts when dealing with integers only but generally considered equitably rounded unless stated otherwise; meaning while dividing them up fairly everyone gets different quantities due various factors involved such differences amongst sizes/weights etc within group itself despite being \u2018equally distributeable.\u2019 Thus following similar principle would imply individuals receiving about six & half units according calculated division process shown above(with respective approximation taken care based upon understanding nature ). As per mentioned calculation way calculating exactly seventeen fifths equals sixty eight over forty five without any further alterations made making actual values close closer matching approximate results provided earlier rather exact mathematical figures obtained through direct calculations instead estimation methodologies used primarily aiming simplification purpose especially regarding tangible non conceptualised physical entities including consumables possessions alike having practical relevance compared purely abstract numerical symbols representing symbolic interpretational aspects unrelated directly applicable situation specific context related implications mainly focus lies entirely embedded towards generalising theoretical construct applications beyond solely logical computational mechanics confined restrictive paradigm limitative scope excluding holistic viewpoint incorporation essential appreciation considering wide spectrum encompassment inclusivity extending far transcending superficiality reductively interpreted restricted narrowness constraining assumptions thereby advocating comprehensive integrated system thoughtful approach facilitated harmonized perspective integrating diverse perspectives embracing multiple facets acknowledging complexity multidimensional analysis required nuanced sensitivity recognising situational variables influencing outcomes demand attention balance sustaining equilibrium ensuring fair distribution justice uphold ethical standards promoting wellbeing social responsibility fostering health conscious environmental awareness cultivate collective stewardship nurture interdependence cooperation collaboration building community solidarity strengthening resilience adaptability preparedness proactive planning contingencies mitigation strategies risk management tactics safeguarding vulnerabilities preempt measures minimize potential adverse impact prevention maximization beneficial effects syn"
