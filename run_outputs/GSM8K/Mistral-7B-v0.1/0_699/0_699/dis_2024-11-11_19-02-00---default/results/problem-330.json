        " coupons, we can say they effectively earned back double reward points which equals 2 times 2.15 i.e., approximately four reward points since you cannot earn partial rewards according to the conditions provided. But note here only whole numbers get counted so consider zero decimal parts too; hence let us discard those .15 part considering rounding down rules mentioned above.

        " or greater than what could go toward discounting the item cost so we round up to get full value out of the offer . Thus if you subtract the actual dollar equivalent ($4 off), you would take your sale price down to...  43 \u2013 4 = 39. But since all amounts deal with whole numbers only , one cannot use any fractional part (.3). Therefore when using real world transaction logic, customers who receive partial credit simply don't apply said reward until future transactions meet certain criteria allowing payment over remaining balance owed under promotional conditions ..

        " they earned ($80/20)*(1)=$4 reward points so far before getting any coupons. Thus when applying these new rules during another trip spending only $43:$43-(4*2)$=$$35$. The difference in cost would just involve subtracting out what could actually apply here because we can not reduce anything below zero! However since our math above shows us one way through dealing those variables \u2013 even if \u201cfractional\u201d ones come up like yours did\u2013 let me show you simpler ways using integers instead\u2026 but always remember integer numbers work better than decimals whenever possible!! Here goes.:::[($43-$4*(2))=$43-$8=$35]$ . Overall though both answers agree thus leaving no confusion!!! ",
        " At their second shop, they spend $43 but use four dollars worth reward as well since it says 'twice.' Therefore, you subtract those six dollar rewards before applying any other discount or coupons like $(43-$6). And because no further discount was mentioned outside these rules we can say (43-6) equals forty seven ($43\u2212$6=$47), which means that; hence, according to your question ;the customer paid thirty seven dollars ((47/2)=23.5+($23*0.5))=(23+(23*.5))=((23)+(11.5)),so round up to whole numbers,we conclude that the client put down twenty three Dollars.(since half cents doesn\u00b4t make sense if not rounded.)This seems pretty accurate based upon information presented within problem statement..So I am sorry my bad math skills let me revise my solution again ...Here goes another attempt:(Note :- As per above assumptions : Customers uses one third part i,.e ,one dollar out of sixty bucks earned through purchases during first visit towards getting future savings...And remaining seventyfour minus ten eighties becomes ninety ones ).Now proceeding accordingly....As stated previously about using previous visits s\u2026answer ..for current benefit thus here what happens .Considering initial scenario:$ Earn rate =$1/$20.$ Value purchased initially=> Total Spent:-[$80+$(-[Reward]$)]=[$80\u2014$(One Third Of Sixth Part)$]=$~77.<br/> Considering later usage of prizes & coupons:[Current Visit]=<b>[Price Paid \u2013 Rewards Usage\u00d7EarningRate]*CouponMultiplier</b>= [TotalValueSpent-(ThirdPartOfPrevious Earns Used)/TenxPercent*$20)* Two]/Twenty]. Hence putting all values into formula yields ",
        " which was $43. Apply the reward points earned ($1) first making it 43 \u2013 1 = $42; applying their coupons makes these further discount (doubled), i.e., reducing the cost again because we know as per question, coupon value equals double the saved rebate($2). Therefore, new balance becomes 42\u20132=$40 remaining.\r",
        " half (half as worth) because it takes double reward off during this visit. That equals $40/$2=2 rewards units taken away here since we split into halves . Multiply those 2 received rewards by its value of $1 per unit to find out how much discount or reduction they make when applying these coupons; hence, subtracting it from what someone initially intended buying. Which means you need to deduct the obtained saved points ($1/unit \u00d72units=$2). To calculate overall cost using both sales promotion offerings(reward cards &coupon), simply take starting balance($43.)then add back savings due to such offers(($4.(from initial calculation above)=total expense before considering all reductions))so your original payment equates roughly speaking around 43.$+2$.=(about) 45 $. Hence , taking everything together : ",
        " divided by $20 equals four. Multiply these results together (number of times you can buy something). Since one thing costing less than or equal to what it would take out all your eligible points plus buying items isn\u2019t possible we start back up with zero purchases taken into consideration since no products under those costs exist therefore multiplying any nonzero quantity like our current result produces nothing meaningless; thus , if none gets subtracted even though enough credit exists due too poor selection according above criteria \u2013 just add everything straight across without anything changed except totalling values individually first before removing expenses again subsequently accumulating value via subtraction only when needed based upon available budget amounts remaining post deductions previously mentioned steps . Result : Customer pays exactly $((the original dollar amount)\u00d7Numberofrewards/dollarspent+remainingcredits)$.
