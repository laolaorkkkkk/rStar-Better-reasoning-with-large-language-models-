Hence since Georges current consumption resulted initially him having (6)x2+(2)=<<(5*(2)+((2)))=12>>candies , Nick currently still possesses exactly twenty four.(12)-five equals fifteen remaining ones .

Good explanation :) thanks!",
        " one, before George consumed any candy we can say g > n (george\u2019s initial amount) was doubled than nick's(n). Given this relationship let us assign s=g/2 so according to the second statement, S-5=(George\u2019 remaining)=g\u22125candies or simply 5+((G\u00d75)/2), therefore our assignment equation becomes; G>(C\u00d75)/2 Since George consumes every single piece means those 5 Candies reduced but when it comes back again remains zero because you cannot find out if someone devoured anything without knowing your original quantity\u2026 That brings us down another route like maybe finding what percentage George initially holds relative too all their shares.. Say georges share represents .x% against Nicks.(since Nick held onto them longer.) Which takes away complexity via reducing variables just leave yourself working purely mathematical operations only no values involved! This implies Georges consumption reduces overall distribution ratio hence leaving lesser percentages available still within shared boundaries thus diminishing individual allocations based off predefined fractional ratios keeping everything under unified framework while also allowing multiple calculations pertaining different parts rather mere arbitrary figures ensuring accuracy across varying scenarios thereby enhancing comprehension & logical reasoning throughout process Thus through understanding underlying theory concepts behind probability theories applied here helps explain why certain quantities relate better vs others whereas direct comparison using numbers may sometimes lead towards potential misinterpretation especially during complex situations involving numerous factors affect influencing outcome Hence helping clarify purpose which ultimately translates into improved problem solving skills thanks largely due simplification principle associated theoretical foundations applicable universally regardless circumstances encountered along pathway toward solution We utilized knowledge regarding proportional relationships among various components present scenario provided requiring calculation evaluation determining possible alternatives considering mentioned constraints prior establish baseline assumptions furthermore applying basic principles related dynamics governing system behaviour relating said entities Within contextual background lies key insight fundamental grasp essential understandings necessary achieving desired result Once complete analysis concludes suitable conclusions reached supporting verdict presented above accordingly providing accurate portrayment situation highlight relevance particular approach adopted Furthermore achieved clarity whilst retaining simplicity crucial maintain cohesion ensure effective communication fostering mutual agreement amongst parties agreeable methodology employed facilitating streamlined progression eliminating unnecessary hurdles hindrance posed otherwise impeding progress Therefore yield valuable insights gained benefits reap advantages realized strengthened partnerships promote collaboration cooperation optimizing workflow maximize efficiency accomplish goals efficiently successfully paving way forward collabor",
