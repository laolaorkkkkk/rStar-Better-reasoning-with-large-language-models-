Thus, Lizbeth gets 1+2=3 packages whereas Margaret receives 3+4=7 purchases (packets). Total amount equals quantity multiplied by unit price/quantity i.e., 20*3 vs 20*7 which results in amounts 60 versus 140 respectively. That leads us straight away calculating difference as 140 minus 60 which yields 80.

Similarly, Margareth buys 3 packs of blue plus 4 packs of red equals sixteen packets all together; hence margaretha also possesses sixty units because multiplying their quantity times unit cost equates to being equal too.(sixteen*(20 pieces per packet))=sixty-(units).
