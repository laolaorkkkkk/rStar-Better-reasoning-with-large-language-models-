        " all which means that if we add up both groups (two-hole ones plus four-hole ones) it equals this quantity i.e.:  7(2)+14=4teen . This shows us that these seven buttons make contribution equal to eleven group items while those fifteen contribute twenty six hence contributing thirty one together since summing them results into forty one.. Hence , there would exist as well three single button counts due their absence making totalling fifty eight altogether; thus rendering seventy six! Which also leads me onto another observation about why I find calculating math puzzles such challenging \u2013 although seemingly simple first look might yield clear answers but sometimes hidden aspects arise only when you examine further details thereby creating complexity beyond initial appearance!! However once unravelled properly everything falls back logically according logic\u2026which proves usefulness despite apparent difficulties inherent initially especially considering varying types differ across ages or educational levels!!! Good job figuring out your strategy though because perseverance always pays off eventually whether directly witnessed immediately afterwards OR long term effects continue manifest differently depending upon personal learning styles & preferences !! :) Thankyou\ud83d\udc4d Keep going strong everyone here\u2019s hoping better luck next time thanks guys !",
        " Buttons \u00d7 Two Holes/Button = 14 Hole Total From one button Type One Button Has Four Pockets (Four-hole types) To determine if you can solve this problem or not multiply together instead of adding them as described above. Find out how many pockets would result based on seven buttens having two hole per type. Multiply Number Of Screws Per Wire With The Amount Of Lines Or Scouts That Each Line Contains As You Can Guess It Is Asking About Six Times Twenty Which Will Give Us Forty Since We Already Have This Value And Its Easy! Add Together These Values Adding All Them Individually Should Bring Overall Totals While Keep Count When Looking At Every Item Check Out Your Work Once Again Just In Case Any Mistakes Made Repeat The Steps Carefully Until Combination Numbers Arrive Without Error First Break Down Everything Step By Step Next Figure Our Target Result Given Below Finally Try Solving What Look Like Similar Problem Go Wherever Chances Are Great I Would Encounter Related "
