Thus, calculating further reveals as follows\u2014the equation becomes Time taken=(Total Distance)/Speed Calculated value/time spent equals:: Taken Value / Unit Over Here Hence Speed can also be used instead of dividing calculation results but here since 'Distance Travelled Per Mile_Hour Equivalent Measurement\" was mentioned explicitly, hence using those terms fits well into context.
