Divide outside fraction into inside ones getting your first part $$(/$)=$$$($$. Repeat calculation but minus second mix amount which leaves just another dollar btw . Find percent increase using formula below : Original Value% increasedamount%=increasePercent%. Replace values here making sure not too add already calculated prices together yet!!
