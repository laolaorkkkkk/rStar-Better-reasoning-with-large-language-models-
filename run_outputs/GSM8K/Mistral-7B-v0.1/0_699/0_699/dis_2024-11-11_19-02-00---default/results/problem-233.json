As per overall situation presented only considering movements without complete elimination conceptually speaking original location holds up unless further explicit conditions specified elsewise like simultaneous exitations coincide among all subjects i.e., everyone going off doesn't mean nobody remains behind thus implying here presence despite movement isn't ceased nor negated unambiguously thereby retaining count amongst initial participants before commencing transition actions under scrutiny subject matter being about existence within predefined domain boundaries against physical relocation activity ensuing consequently ensuring maintainational positional integrity preserving numerical entity quantification irrespective alteration process observed during temporal evolution phase involved this particular event sequence unfoldment discourse alignable logically reflectively interpretable intellectueltly corroborative reinforced rationale solidified upheld validation verifiable substantiate credibility reliability attributable authenticity confirmation fact finding investigation rigorous meticulous methodical scrupulousness empiricism experimental valid proof demonstratively illustrative testament evidentiary documentation evidence tangible actualization palpable occurrence witness account definitive unequivocal concrete assurance beyond shadowy doubt absolute certainty assured infallibility indubitably nonpartisan fair assess judicious neutral impartial adjudicatory body authoritative magistrature statutory legality jurisprudent governance legislative oversight regulatory compliance enforcement mechanisms prevention mitigation countermeasures proactive strategies curtail illegal activities criminal acts fraud embezzlement malfeasance maleficent nefarious deeds treachery deceit duplicitious artifices machiavellian schemata plots conspiracies manipulations conniving intricacies schemes contrivances stratagems gambits shams fabrications phantom apparitions specters mirage illusions vapourizes pseudonymized digital footprint traceback techniques analytics algorithm computations statistical inference modelling predictive dynamics forecast probabilistic out",

Thus resulting group size would become twice larger than before because each condition applies independently but affects only third part not whole population!

        " 36 penguins. When another third (which again equals 12) went into the cave to eat their dinner, we subtract these groups leaving behind  36 - 12 - 12 = 12 penguins who continued sunning themselves outdoors. The answer is: 12.",
        " so another third went inside the cave because it\u2019s also equal part mentioned here (one-third goes underwater; as no other behavior was specified this can be assumed). This means again  12 penguins went inside the cave too since 36 divided evenly gets us three groups or 'one-thirds'. Therefore, initially we subtract those who moved away, i.e.,   36 (total) \u2013 12(who swim) \u2013 12(who leave to caves)= remaining equals to 12penguins . These all could possibly continue sun basking. Hence the answer would indeed remain same regardless whether they returned back or not considering question didn\u2019t provide information about returning action happening simultaneously! ",
        " those who stayed (the ones not included above). Since both actions involved only a third each time, we can simply calculate it as follows: First action (to get rid of) : Original amount times fraction taken away means original amount minus result equals remaining amount -> 36 \u2212 (36*1/3) leaves us with the count before considering other group \u2192 This yields 36-(36/3)=36-12=24 Penguins remained alive but unsung until counting out what happened next To find remainder uninvolved \u2013 Second Action \u2014 Calculate second third like first using subtraction method instead adding since this isn\u2019t cumulative yet again subtract resulting value here once too rather than doing twice unlike summing together because no additive operation called required within scope parameters described henceforth just taking off numbers sequentially therefore calculating solely based upon single events happening subsequently without addition intermediary calculation steps being necessary according established instructional guidelines specifications provided thus avoiding unnecessary arithmetic operations while keeping focus restricted narrow strictly towards task objective direct extractions relevant data values derived exclusively via deductive reasoning applied singular instance quantifications implying solitary event occurrences throughout entire series timeline excluding concurrent activity amalgamation considerings thereby eliminating excess computative processes associated complexities beyond immediate necessitation requirement fulfillment aim objectives explicitly delineated requirements stipulations set forth precise terms detailed comprehensive particularity contained exhaustively inclusively leaving nonessential supplementary information irrelevant superfluous peripherals discarded maintain streamlined succinct efficiency optimum productivity outcome maximization adherence compliance strict conformity exactness absolute precision accurate calculations verifiable proof valid support evidence corroborating conclusions arrived through logical rationale sound critical thinking rational analysis scientific investigatory procedures rigorously scrupulous examination meticulous review scrutiny thorough checking validation testing evaluation ensuring consistent repeatable accuracy dependability reliability uniform consistency standardized performance metrics benchmarks assessments calibrating comparisons baselines establishes credibility trustworthiness integrity authenticity genuineness assurances verified legitimate operational protocol conformance quality control standards implementation effectiveness results yield satisfactory output expected deliverables achieved success guaranteed certainty assured confidence reliable capable competent proficient expert skillful knowledge professional trained experienced personnel committed focused effort concentrated attention dedicated dedication intense hard work diligent labor strenuous endeavor significant progress substantial advancement considerable improvement dramatic growth",
        " also 12. That means initially we accounted twice (once for those who jumped in, once for those going to eat). Since both groups came out as exactly same amount, i.e., 12; hence only half remains behind or it can equivalently said like 'one group', since all other information was about movements happened within this original batch already present among these ones namely not coming outside but changing location amongst themselves!

Therefore, we would add these numbers (two-third) together because those groups don\u2019t belong anymore while calculating what remains behind since they used up all three parts mentioned earlier before it was asked.\r",
        " remaining after these first jumps as 36 - 12 = 24 penguins remain outside. From this pool of 24, another third (which equals half) choose to hide inside the cave or continue sunning themselves since we don\u2019t differentiate between 'inside the iceberg' and elsewhere; hence it remains unchanged when considering our original question because both actions involve staying outdoors but just changing location within sight range rather than moving away entirely. Thus no further subtraction needs taking place based purely upon \u2018outside vs shelter preference'.
