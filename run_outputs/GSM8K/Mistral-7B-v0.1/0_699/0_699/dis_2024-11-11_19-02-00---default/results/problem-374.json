Similarly multiply the number of sheep producing one kilogram of milks (also identified before) by its respective quantity. That means 7*1kg=7 kilograms obtained when these same sheep yield double what others get (per unit time), but it only counts once because all cows together make up whole weight totals not multiplied sums separately; you add weights without duplicating measures here! Hence summing everything up equals just adding both figures above which comes down naturally if counted individually thus making no need for extra steps since multiplication already provides individual contributions within context while addition brings back original combined scale into perspective..

From those remaining fifteen animals, their daily yield increases significantly as well; twice twenty gram per animal makes forty five thousand grams or four tons! This results into both halves adding another ten plus ninety seven points seventeen...or nearly thirty pounds altogether....which would sum upto almost double what was initially expected due only considering simple division but without consideration toward increased production rates provided through proper farming techniques like optimal grazing management systems etc., therefore resulting thereby higher outputs even though smaller numbers being fed under better conditions compared against earlier methods utilized previously.. That explains why despite having fewer cows overall than before(because less feed cost saves resources)they actually produce greater amounts too since no extra labor needed during process nor expensive chemical additives required unlike conventional ways leading towards maximizing profit potential while reducing costs furthermore providing environment friendly practices along side improved quality standards all round good news indeed!!!!!",
