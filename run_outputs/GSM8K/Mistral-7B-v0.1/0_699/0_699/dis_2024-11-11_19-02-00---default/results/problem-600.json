        " it was initially eight pounds. Calculate the increased amount which is fifty percent (or half) of the initial weight. Halfway increase would mean adding four additional pounds ((8*50%) equals 4). This makes the new weight twelve pounds ((original+increase=8+4)). But Jamaal finds this burdensome, prompting him to drop down twenty pounds less or sixteen pounds; therefore, ultimately he lifts only eighteen pounds finally ((twelve minus twenty equals sixteen plus two results into eighteen)) as per the question asked.
