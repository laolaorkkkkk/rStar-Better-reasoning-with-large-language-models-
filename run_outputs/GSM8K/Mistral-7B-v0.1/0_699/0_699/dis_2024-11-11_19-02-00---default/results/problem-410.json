One full priced bag would lead us to spend $6 ($3 price multiplied three).

This results in no further discount needed because our purchase included enough quantity such that both full prices apply equally; therefore making them equivalent instead like before once summed resulting back into another calculation equaling twice just purchased amounts plus initial cents part remaining leaving us yet again same amount found above ie.:$2.5 , or simply:(purchase+(quantity_of_.+$remaining)\u00d7price_each)_both+=totalSpent=($.5)+((3 \u00d7 (2)+(.5))...which yields similarly:$2.(5)/2=$ 2.5 exactly!.

To solve this linear equation let\u2019s use algebraic methods : $-0.1X=-6$, divide both sides by negative one half ; $(-.1/.5)=(-6/-1)$; therefore:$X=(60)$.

Thus according my calculations the remainder would actually come out exactly as it says here but I made these steps before you provided me your previous edit (it seems like i didn't make those mistakes when considering both scenarios). Accordingly revising them... First let's understand the problem properly; To clarify things based upon our understanding of percentages and their corresponding mathematical operations. We know that buying one piece or any item doesn\u2019t involve calculating anything extra due to its unitary value being mentioned directly(here meaning either dollar values without need to calculate fractional part because units aren't halved). But next time while solving such problems instead subtract first whole numbers ($3+$1.50)and just afterwards add fractions($0.25*4)/first subtraction result-(which stands true for all arithmetic equations whether integer operation happens only or not), if anyone wonders why don't simply skip adding last addition till very start avoid confusion later ; even multiplication cancels half parts resulting less burden especially useful during large numerical computations . Next lets go back again towards original question , recall once said \u2018taffy comes twice cheaper than normal rate..\u2019 Therefore implying since every single gram costs us nothing otherwise no savings occur! Which means second purchase becomes negligible thus eliminated altogether making solution look somewhat trivial yet effective mathematically!! Moreover remember too often heard phrase \u201cwhenever saving goes down below zero\u201d implies wrong direction hence keep check always against signs used right way : Negative symbols sign indicating debts / expenditure whereas positive ones indicate incoming cash flow \u2013 balance sheet accounts work accordingly whenever accountants want perfect records matching real life situations accurately enough ..
