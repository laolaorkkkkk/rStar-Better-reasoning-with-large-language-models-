        " per year using this information. That would be $25/week * 48 weeks = $1200 spent on food per year. Subtracting regular expenses (food & treat) leaves us just looking into pet medication which can easily calculate as being $100* 12 months= $1200 over one year period . This means madeline pays about :$2400+$1200=$<<2400+1200>>3600 every year exclusively towards upkeep. Final ",
        " $1200 on food every year. As mentioned earlier, treatments amount up to $20*12=$<<20*12=240>>240 annually while medicine amounts to $100/month or $100*12= <<100*12=1200>>$1200 over one year period. Adding all these expenditures together; We get $1200+$240+$1200= $<<1200+240+1200=2640>>2640 spent per year. Therefore, The answer is: 2640.",
        " month. Since treatment prices remain constant throughout the entire time period (therefore doesn\u2019t vary over several years) we multiply price X frequency ($20/month*12= )= \\$240 spent annually for treatments. We can apply same calculation approach here for other expenses as well; calculate annual medication expense=$100*12 =$1200 Per year drug bill or medical bills add up to another \\$1200 Medically related items constitute about half of Madeline\u2019s dogs budget every year Total amount paid towards healthcare caregiving including vet visit fees, emergency visits, etc., amounts to around $3900 altogether Thus, Annual Spendings(Annual Health Expenses)=Total Money Earned-Health Care Cost($3900-$1440)$, which equals to $$$$$$$. Finally subtract this value i.e. $(Dog_Budget-(Dog_Care))$, because what exactly question asks us ,we need find out how much extra one pays .Thus "
