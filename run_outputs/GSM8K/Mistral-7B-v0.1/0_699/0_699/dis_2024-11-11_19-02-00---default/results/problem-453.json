        " x 2 = $2400. Subtract three sapphires because she exchanged them for those two other gems (not counted towards their original amount). Three sapphires equate to a dollar cost of $800 x 3 = $2400 which was gained through trade; hence this doesn\u2019t affect overall wealth since it balances as gain/loss against existing assets already valued separately earlier ($6400) under previous conditions before considering transaction exchange effect directly related only within immediate change event horizon itself without taking into account its impact prior or post any associated events like market fluctuations etc., rather we just need look over here what new quantity remains owing merely due specifically arising strictly solely via own action taken immediately following latest known last confirmed documented fact reported upfront describing actual historical circumstances leading way finally culminating presently present circumstance exactly resulting exclusively stemming directly consequent upon recent past occurrences independently disregarding anything having happened subsequently unrelated thereto yet still preserving intact absolute veracity relative pertaining whole story throughout entire timeline involved including most likely future developments depending precisely when these latter mentioned additional particular incidents occur however nevertheless always guarantee complete fidelity across full breadth narrative entirely encompassing preceding factors potentially linked implicitly somehow indirect perhaps tangentially nonetheless ultimately ensuring precision despite potential deviations otherwise assumed caused purely externally induced external influences acting deliberately behind scenes either knowingly hidden covert operation executed surreptitiously causing subliminal manipulations thereby altering core reality underlying foundational truth whilst avoiding direct scrutiny visually discernible thus rendering visible evidence inconclusive absent careful analysis conducted methodically according established scientific protocol utilizing specialized advanced technology capable detecting minute traces typically invisible human eye barely perceives but crucial data essential differentiating facts objectivity vs subjectivity often considered secondary although primary actually determines accuracy substantially increasing confidence level particularly amongst experts possess vast knowledge regarding specific disciplinary field concerned involving relevant domain expertise required skillfully applied correctly therefore making reliable judgment sound beyond reasonable doubt provided critical thinking skills honed rigorously employing logical reasoning employed appropriately yield valid inference based strongly supported empirical observations derived thoroughly examined using proven techniques learned early school years followed systematically refining cognitive processing gradually building cumulatively sophisticated understanding complex concepts mastery achieved slowly accruing progress toward perfect attainment becoming virtually ind",
        " That\u2019s 8 * $800 = $<<8*800=6400>>6400. Then consider trade which didn\u2019t affect monetary amount as it was just trading equivalent values (since we know only about their individual values). Lastly calculate gemstones exchanged during barter; here exchange rate isn\u2019t mentioned so no change can occur without any information available . All this leads us to conclude before making further calculations ,total valuation would remain untouched considering our current dataset/available info provided above(bartered goods don&apos;;e appear equal valued within stipulated timeframe) due lack precision regarding potential gains or losses through said transactions\u2014so one might infer though possibly flawed extrapolation : original treasure troves maintained stable despite seemingly complex transactional activity occurring ; thus affirming hypothesis /theory suggesting nonaltered cash reserves subsequent postpurchase events !

        " this amount because three sapphires (worthing as per their quantities) disappeared from storage due to trade; meaning we subtract about $(3*$800=$2400), which results into $6400-$2400=$4000 still existing under inventory valuation before considering other inputs like exchanged rubies whose combined market price adds up furthermore impacting monetary stockpile evaluation metrics.

        " away. This leaves us with (8 - 3) sapphires or 5 remaining sapphires which equates into a monetary amount of ($800*5). Add onto this using one set of 2 new rubies as well valued at $1200 per ruby times (2*$1200), adding up altogether we get Total Value($6400+$800*(8\u22123)+$1200(2)=$6400+$4000+$2400=$12800.) so their overall combined current market valuation amounts being equal to **$12800**.",
        " the amount of Rubies because she obtained another ones in exchange so 2+1=3Rubies (since we don\u2019t know if those earlier mentioned 'two Ruby trade', was considered separately or additionally) This makes it mean their value would multiply as such; ($1200)*(3)=$3600 Thus far, this puts together the monetary values into one dollar figure making up the whole set thus becoming ;($6400+$3600). Doing math operations you get a sum equal to : $10k . It doesn't matter what type of gems they are nor how expensive gold looks like etc.. Just focus solely onto calculation results when looking upon costs associated directly w/ sales prices listed within problem statements only!
