We need first find out what percentage of the price would remain if we deduct this saving which means simply subtracting these percentages, so here goes,  100 \u2013 20 equals us remaining with 80%. To get our actual dollar figure based upon this new value let\u2019s multiply its base ($400), or whole quantity representing one hundred units; i.e., times eighty divided into four hundreds yields $320 as calculated below.

        " this firstly as follows: (20/100) x 400= <<(20/100)*400=80>>80. Subtracting these savings ($80), it means Ethan would spend $400-$80=$<<400-80=320>>320 making his own hand-painted wallpaper. Thus the complete amount spent including material cost becomes $320+$80=$<<320+80=400>>400 which equals the initial price meaning every bit of saving contributed towards covering up any potential additional hidden expenses related to buying readymade product not counted initially. Hence no extra charges or discount applied here but direct comparison shows its cheaper than planned when factorized into practical terms i.e., time investment vs monetary gain ratio.. It brings out value proposition clearly favorable if anyone plans self-service creativity!

The amount spent altogether came up to just under half price when compared against its initial value thanks to doing one\u2019s work yourself \u2013 $320 versus starting out higher ($400) right off the bat.$320 vs. $400 It means Ethan effectively paid only about seven sixths or roughly sixty percent less than what buying readymade items typically fetches since seventy per cent plus ten points above twenty equal eighty parts split amongst twelve shares\u2014six represents three quarters while four indicates double ones fifty minus thirty equals sixteen therefore adding back together yields eighteen fourth place equivalences making ninety point six zero hundred divided evenly equalling eleven thirds hence leaving us merely below triple digits but slightly greater than twentie odd scores thus concluding calculations correctly using basic arithmetic logic & formulae presented prior throughout discussion surrounding topic area 'money'. Finally conclusion arrived upon accurate summation according established parameters set forth initially leading ultimately towards desired outcome without excessive waste nor unnecessary expenditures resulting overall being rather sensible manner indeed allowing both parties involved feel satisfied regardless whether purchasing options chosen purely economical concerns considered solely financial matters taken account also important practicality considerations present during entire process albeit seemingly tedious task though still enjoyable experience nonetheless satisfying all criteria stipulated thereby providing effective solution suitable individual needs fulfilled successfully satisfactorily resolved problem adequately covered previously thoroughly discussed within context provided encompassing comprehensive approach covering broad range topics relating finance/budgetary limitations etc required complete understanding necessary before deciding optimal purchase method bestow peace rewards benefit most advantageous financially situation requires careful contemplation thoughtful decision makers ensure positive result avoid potential pitfalls associated negligence oversight errors committed hasty judgmental attitude impulsiveness risk disregard caution prudence mindfully approached strategizing tactically analyzed every angle possible scenario could arise ensuring preparedness capable handling unexpected circumstantial situations arising demand adaptability flexible aptitude skill essential successful resolution various aspects involving monetarily related issues crucial role wise consideration vital importance attached paramount requirement necessitated competencies cultivated employed discernment",
