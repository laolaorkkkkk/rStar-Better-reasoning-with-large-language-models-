To correct course though; let us revise our calculations according specifically referenced scenarios...so here we go again: Firstly calculate overall attrition ratio including both incidents combined\u2014summing individual percentages results roughly yields about ~72% reduction approximately summed up overtime using additive fraction formula i..e multiplying decimal parts individually adding values subsequently yield~ .Eg.: Fraction loss =~ ((1/3)*numberInitialElf)+((TotalLostAfterSecondVomiting)/RemainingNoMoreOfFirst)=(.3*=firstTwoDamagedDeptWorkers+lastTwelveDisillusionmentFactorBasedDecisionsFromPoorAttitudes))/(nLeft)! Hence simplified expression can look somewhat linear formulation resembling : Frac=(a*(x))+(b-(c*) )where b stands average surviving figures among damaged parties while c takes account pessimistic projections made assuming high severity correlation cases tend lead worse experiences thus reducing willing participation later stages.) Next utilize calculated fractions via cross multiplication strategy employng proportions principle involving denominators intertwined proportional relationship amongst three distinct groups namely intact population pool following prior year losses,(remainder),(and cumulative decreases experienced through subsequent unfortunate events respectively): Rearranging terms accordingly offers alternative approaches allowing direct insertion into conventional equation formatting ensuring compliance constraints established alongside associated data points correlated simultaneously observed occurrences:(originalSize)->(attritionRatePercentage)(nonetheless additional factors remain influential concerning revised expectancies perhaps indicating slight underestimation errors arising mostly based solely upon inherent presumptions underlying preliminary models used therefore warrant careful evaluation against actual realm practicalities encountered during operational proceedings!)
