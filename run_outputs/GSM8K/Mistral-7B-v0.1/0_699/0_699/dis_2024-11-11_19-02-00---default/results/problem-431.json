Calculate if Dora can afford everything or not by comparing what she needs versus what\u2019s available through subtraction such as Total Price-$ Amount With Which To Buy= Shortage/Excess This would become $19 -$18=$1 shortfall meaning this means Dora requires additional funds worth one dollar so yes indeed our computation shows us that dear little girl misses another buck to get those fun stuffies hence I conclude therefore answering no other sums matter here only these figures count towards fulfilling current demand thus confirmation ends my verdict once upon time till next round comes your math whiz!
