        " first question because it said their ages correspond directly to actual numbers so if sally thirty two(named such because this was our key reference)is eight...if grannies red name corresponds (it being mentioned just before strawberry who would obviously come next but since its named right after grape already),to strawberries names indicating twice or doubled value.....grape corresponding halfage means Grape=half*eight..Grape==four....Strawberry is actually meaning one year younger than triple twenty plus ten.(twenty+ten)*3-(one)= sixty seven ....Then lastly twentythreewhich implies add fifteen equals thrice sixteen i.e.(three*sixteen)+fifteen == seventy seven thus adding them together gets you forty eight .the answer is : 48 .",

Since this one cannot exist since its name suggests different ages hence not possible but if both names refer only to their respective owners; next up would be granny red because sally three was created specifically referring towards being younger compared to grandma red(she referred too herself) Accordingly though due to lacking sufficient information about them having any relation or sequence through time ,we could conclude all together still holds true under no relations conditions . As per our calculations here : Sally Three=Age unspecified ; GrandMomRed/GrannyTwo Age Unspecified yet knowing nothing happens till later makes us assume none happened just came along randomly even existing possibly during said event occurring yesterday!
