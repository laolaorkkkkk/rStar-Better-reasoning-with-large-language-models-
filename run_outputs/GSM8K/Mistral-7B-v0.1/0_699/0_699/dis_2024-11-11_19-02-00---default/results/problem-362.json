        " for a chihuahua bed. Similarly, it says here that this kind needs just 2 pounds of stuffing.

It reads three dogs \u2013 one of which happens to take all our attention as its name 'collie'. Three represents therefore, the denominator when you derive Collie\u2019s Stuff Needed through calculating averages; numerically speaking addition of what these other breed pair asks yields six whereas dividing back again amongst ourselves offers us twice upon another round down before finally arriving onto sum equals four times hence taking away half plus extra pound per unit creates woeful imbalance thus leaving only single portion intact alongside remnant bits otherwise known famously under \u2018baggage fee.\u2019 As previously figured above I surmise using said metric my initial calculation ought correctly estimate consumption while accounting within respective variances arising during production thereby minimizing waste accordingly reducing overall expenditure whilst maintaining quality simultaneously preserving customer satisfaction concurrently further ensuring future repeat orders thanks largely due diligence adherence maintenance methods applied throughout entire process albeit minor adjustments necessitated occasionally occasioned primarily owing external factors beyond immediate control nonetheless allowing precise measurement accuracy via regular checks executed periodical basis fortuitously eliminating undesired overrun situations possibly leading towards potential losses suffered elsewhere consequently safeguarding integrity & honesty prominantly associated closely correlated directly bound intricately intertwined tight knit network formed linking multiple stakeholders mutually benefiting synergistically working cooperatively harmoniously contributing collaborative effort joint efforts resulting successful completion tasks profitable business operation maximization profitability ultimately yield desired financial gains satisfying shareholder expectations enhancing reputation elevating status among competitors creating edge distinctive advantages positioning enterprise higher rung ladder corporate hierarchy securing market shares expand territories conquer challenging competition successfully emerging victorious triumphant glory acknowledged worldwide celebrated across industries commended globally revered unmatchable excellence recognized internationally lauded legendary standing established permanent fixture forever engraved indelible mark impression lasting legacy impact resonating timeless influence immortalized transcendent achievement eternal con",

To find this we add up both numbers together ((Rottweiler bed stuffing plus Chihuahua Bed Stuffing)/two). This comes out as follows;  \t(8+2)/2= 10/2= 5 . We determine the material used within one round trip (Collie bed): since it only uses halfway towards either extreme point provided (i.e., 5), Collie Beds require 5 Pounds Of Material Per Round Trip As such when combining all three types together :    4*(Chihuahua Bed Stuffing)=   4*2 pounds=      8 Pounds      Plus            Three*(Collie Bed Stuffing)=       3*5 pounds=        15 Pound          Total combined stuffing requirements therefore equals eight plus fifteen , equaling twentythree pounds requiring further analysis based solely upon current information available via inputs presented thus far..

        " pounds for a Chihuahua bed so that means Collies take ((2+8)/2) which equals (10/2=5). Therefore a large Bed would require 5 pounds of Stuffings. Given this information let's calculate: four Dog Beds using materials needed for one Cheeahuahua bathe times seven plus three cheeahuahua bathe amounts times materials used per Bathe... or..(4x2)+(3x5)= 23 pounds! ",
        " find out how much goes into a Collie bed, let's calculate this as (Rottweiler) /(Chihuahua). That equals 8/2=4 which means four times less so it needs half just like one kind plus another time because its an even mix right?. Each Collie gets roughly 2+4*0.5 or about ~4 pounds apiece . Ok ,now lets get calculating...for all three types combined :  2x4= <<2*4=8>>8 pounds needed for 4 ChiUbahal Beds;plus those original eight pounder Rottersbed ;that brings us up to ...total...... 8+8 =<<8+8=16>>16pounds used. ",
        " Collie beds; (Collie) would use [R(x)-C(y)]/2 which means it uses [(8-2)/2] or 3 pounds per Bed since averaging two values simply divides their sum by 2 so this comes out as follows :[4*2+3*3= 8+(9)=17]. Total amounts of materials needed combined come up to eighteen when adding them together therefore our formula looks like [[4*(r\u2212c)+3*d]=e | r=8 , c=2 & d=3 . This equals 17 thus making 'E'. I hope this helps!!! The answer is: 17.",

Note also Collies use half as much stuffing as Dobermans but not quite so less than Giant Schnauzers! Thus their weight comes out to being approximately ((Rottweilers)*(Dobermans))/((GiantSchnauer)) or roughly equivalent to ((Collies)*)=(8+3)/(4)).
