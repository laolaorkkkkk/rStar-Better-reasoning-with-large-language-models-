Since we know Sue earned $5 per ten minute worksession; first determine when Sue stops working during those three hours i.e what\u2019s remained if you subtract breaks or idle times. One hundred eighty divided by six equals thirty because one thousand sixty seconds equal fifteen groups of twelve periods of twenty four seconds hence amount due it means soccer ball bounce count as follows: Total Work Sessions Count/Earnings Per Session. Therefore fifty percent off our initial calculation would result to 22. Fifty percent less than forty would leave us with eighteen dollar figures being equivalently distributed throughout this schedule meaning seventeen minus one yields sixteen consequently resulting in sixteenth plus four equalling twenty zero becomes nineteen ultimately representing actual income collected.
