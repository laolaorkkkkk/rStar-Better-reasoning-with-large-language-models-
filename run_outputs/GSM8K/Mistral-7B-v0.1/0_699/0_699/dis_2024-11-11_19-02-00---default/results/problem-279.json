According to another piece of information \u201cIn nine (9) year(s), Ruby will be three times (3x )as old as Sam\u201d, we can set up this equation: ruby_age+9=3*(sam_age+9). We already know that ruby_age equals 6*Sam's_age , so let replace those expressions accordingly . This creates following expression :    `((6*x)+9)= (3*(x+9))`   Simplify further --> `(6*x)` becomes just `6x`, remove parentheses--> '6X'==='3X'+27 => '-3x='=-27       ---->`\u2018x\u2018=`-(27/(-3))            simplification yields:`x:=3                     Thus,'[Sam]=(x)-> [3]`So our result shows us -- **Sam**is currently **three(3)**years old!
