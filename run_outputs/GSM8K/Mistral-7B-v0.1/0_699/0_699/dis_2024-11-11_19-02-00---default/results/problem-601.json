        " was able to save twice what he could last year so instead of saving just once a month he would double it (to save 2) which means another 2*12=24 additional games purchased. At this point we can calculate the amount of available games using our equation below; Games Playing/Buying + Game Gifts = Total Available Games. This becomes ((Previous Year\u2019s Purchases or Savings)*(Year Two Shopping Rate)/Game Cost)+Gift Amount during Second Period=(Prior Buys OR Prior Saves*(New Spending Rate))+Second Half of the Year Holiday PackagesReceived((Available Games From First Year )+(NumberOfHolidayPackagesDuringTheSecondPeriod)). We already calculated prior purchases or savings because both activities happened continuously throughout the entire previous period.(Last Month SP + CurrentMonthSP)=Total Last Month SP. And since everything went uninterrupted through time,(AllSpentThroughTime before current purchase window)(Current Spendrateoverall pre-purchase window)+holidaygamesreceivedinsecondperiod=.([First Years spends]*[Increased SaveRate])+(numberofgamepackagesecondevent).

        " Next year, he doubles this amount because he can afford 2 games per month instead of just one. That means during the second year we take the first year\u2019s purchases plus twice these amounts or rather doubled them like so; 17 (games already saved/purchased before starting second year)+(2*12)=41. Finally, we account for all those four times since it took three whole years until he could save up half of what was necessary even though technically only 2 out of these 'three' full cycles went past but let us include everything regardless hence adding another  41+((4*4))=85 \u2013 finally add together the initial presents received over time , including several other annual gifts worth exactly same value ; thus resulting equation becomes below :     iii.

However assuming standard business practice applies ; Whereas normal operational expenditures involving purchase orders placed ahead time rather than reactive cost cutting measures occur regularly even though sometimes unplanned circumstances may arise unexpected requiring adjustment accordingly.. When taking both scenarios described previously together hence resulting equation formula below:)First Equation=(Total Spenders)-[(Cumulative spenders]+[Incremental consumptions] Second Equation=-=[Initial Number Of Product Units Available To Customer][Addition Cost Per Unit].[Price Adjustments Made By Company Upon Each Occasion.]Third Equation:[Adjusted Sales Volume]= [(Start Price \u2013 End Prices)/End Profits]*[(Prevailing Supplier Base)]/(Avg Production Time Needed Between Batch Productions.)Fourth And Final Step Calculate Required Storage Space=.([Volume Used Multiplied]/Average Monthly Temperatures].So basically i am creating my own customized software program through various equations designed around typical sales patterns encountered throughout different industries across diverse geographical regions worldwide while simultaneously incorporating factors related directly towards price manipulation tactics utilised commonly employed amongst vendors attempting maximise customer appeal therefore ultimately increasing share value growth potential respectively ..which leads me nicely",
        " per month, but only for half the first year, so we can multiply the months in this timeframe by 2(1/2). This would result in approximately  1*((1+6)/2)*1=3.5 . Next, since during the second year he purchased double what he was able to purchase previously while still making use of both purchasing power; therefore ,his accumulation rate becomes twice its previous volume ; Therefore it results into ((2)-3)=(-1); It means rather than augmenting his collection by doubling his quantity or spending capacity through acquiring additional resources such as cash via employment opportunities ,He experienced shrinkage owing possibly poor management skills & insufficient planning capability..
