        " It says Amy made 20 more friends than Lily so we add this amount (20) onto the original figure (Lily\u2019s count). That means Amy made 50+20=70 friends. Determine combined friendships if you need their sum or differences depending upon requirement identified earlier. Since it doesn\u2019t ask about either condition just state 'Amy made X Friends', here substitute \u2018X\u2019 represents calculated value which comes out as Amy making 70 friends; hence complete solution would conclude \u201cFinal ",
        " Calculate the absolute value relationship using subtraction as it demonstrates numerical comparison without regard to direction (either less or greater). Therefore subtract 'lesser amount'. Subtracting these values yields |[CALCULATION]| = |50 \u2013 20|=|Amy's Friends|\u224830. To determine combined friend count add individual totals [ADDITION].

With this equation B=A+20 since Ami has twenty additional Friends... We need one last piece before solving any equations however which tells us who actually ended up making fewer/more Friends throughout their time apart.(Condition 3 states only ONE person here ends up having MORE FRIENDS meaning both conditions above combined tell u specifically HOW MUCH HELLPED THIS PERSON OUT AND WHEN WOULD THEY GET SLAMMED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS LOOKING FOR.).. Condition Three : Out Of ALL Four Characters Here , Only One Person Ends Up Having More ATTRACTION From Someone Else ! To keep things simple lets use letters representing individuals such as X & Z instead names like 'John Duckie'. When looking back through all three conditions you can see what happens when trying various combinations using different amounts until finally arriving at something consistent with every single variable used within these statements ; It seems pretty obvious!
