From here out all remains uncertain but since everything depends directly upon previous information I guess these steps might take around\u2026 As no further info was provided so one could argue both would still hold equal weight regarding future behavior or possible changes within any circumstances leading either way; thus only conclusion may seem plausible under said assumptions while recognizing alternative scenarios such those including unpredictable factors impacting speed along path before arrival point reached etc..

Therefore John and Jack still only needed twelve more minutes to reach their destination. Thus if they continue along this pathway upon arrival, they could not make it back home again prior closing down shop since eleven hours earlier than normal commute times exist due its proximity thus making both parties unable to partake further travel activities within reasonable human standards established during ordinary business hour periods across global societies including but not limited too those practiced amongst urban citizenry subcultures as well specifically American ones who tend toward such behavior quite often indeed almost always unfortunately usually because most Americans prefer convenience over punctuality especially when faced unpleasant choices involving multiple transport options none satisfactory enough otherwise considering local traffic conditions alongside population density factors affecting pedestrian flow etc even though occasionally exceptions occur here sometimes randomly whenever necessary circumstances present themselves suddenly unexpectedly forcing individuals outside normative expectations thereby necessitating unusual accommodation measures beyond usual course requirements normally followed according strictly defined rules regulating public infrastructure maintenance practices throughout entire country whereas typically citizens obey laws albeit compliance rates vary significantly depending largely primarily based social background mainly age wise demographics although younger adults generally conform better versus elder groups possibly owing less rigid thinking patterns resulting perhaps simply habitually acquired behaviors rather learned belief systems formed early childhood experiences shaping individual values attitudes opinions judgments decisions actions reactions emotional responses thought processes language usage habits speech tone pitch variations frequency amplitudes wave forms sound pressure levels decibel readings noise exposure measurements impact assessment reports safety data sheets product information documents market research surveys consumer satisfaction ratings quality control test methods testing procedures evaluation techniques analyses statistics evaluations reviews critiques feedback comments appraisals conclusions recommendations followups updates enhancements improvements corrections revisions modifications adjustments alterations changes made subsequent investigations observations experimental results quantitative analysis qualitative reasoning discussions debate arguments debunk fallacies logical flaws factual errors false statements myth busters misinformation propaganda bias distortion lies conspiracy theories hallucinations delusions superstitions magic witchcraft enchantment spells hex incantations curses blessings prayers supp",

Therefore John & jack still have half hour(the same span since one second cannot count here), but considering both fractions only whole numbers can serve purpose meaning all extra portion excluding any leftover fraction means even if taken into consideration such factors like breaks while also including waiting periods during transits etc., no additional hours could ever come about through those said elements due solely restraint over individual pace/frequency maintained against deadline set forth hence making result zero thereby suggesting absence not presence albeit minor potentialities may emerge subjecting themselves however minute though nonetheless remain unaffective owning itself inherently inconsequential towards alteration perception despite its relative worth under certain circumstances bearing mind factual context involves precise duration limit rather than overall timeline magnitude .
