In addition, it takes him another two hours (making sure we add up all six) when he makes one less sale than before but charges higher prices so indeed he would also make good revenue off this additional income too; those extra sales bring even bigger profits because as usual customers who buy something cheaper tend towards buying larger quantities compared against ones priced outrageously high \u2013 therefore resulting into increased overall purchase amounts leading ultimately toward greater sums obtained once again through repeat purchases!
