Since Bob has 10 such beds, multiply this amount by 10 so we need 32*10 = 320 cubic feet of soil altogether. Knowing that each bag contains 2 cubic feet of soil, you can figure out how many bags are necessary dividing our overall requirement by what fits into a single bag; hence divide 320/2 equalizing it down to exactly 160 bags. Because every pack comes upfront as being worth $12, multiplying your unit price against its quantity results us in having spent around $12*160=$1920 across all buys. Therefore, Bob ends spending about $1920 solely on filling those ten rows using new purchased sod or compost mixes. But if only considering whole numbers without decimals involved due their practical context like counting items sold! Let\u2019s say instead use approximate values here : let's round off both figures \u2014 meaning estimate any fractions either above / below certain point within range acceptable limits , thus making calculations involving multiplication slightly different compared when precise integers used..
