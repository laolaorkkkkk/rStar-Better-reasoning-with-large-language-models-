This indicates we need to calculate half Ann\u2019s age i.e., double it as per usual rules (since ann herself was less than average). To find out what would happen within three year time duration since people grow older over these few passing times. Thus if you multiply any annual increase event/factor(time) related value against its equivalent multiplier term or constant; this becomes very easy computation task so lets start calculating! Firstly subtracting their respective values together gets one summed amount equalization factor known commonly called \u2018annual growth rate\u2018 whose formula involves no addition work \u2013 just simple subtraction only .

Add ten(+3)to get nineteen(?)+(-)?=nineteen (?)=nineteen (-?)=-sixteen fifteen fourteen thirtyone fortytwo.. This trick works because we always use negative or positive numbers only during calculation part not while writing answers back into plain text so just forget about them here its all good no confusion let your brain rest thanks anyways !!! :D . You can solve this using simple algebra , first lets define what variables represent ->a represents ann's initial age i_b equals bob ' s income yrs indicates time passed & maxi means maximum possible value according totwo times smaller than original amount ; therefore equation becomes ax+(y*m)max=x; simplified further down obtaining formula f=>ax=(ym)-mx =>f:(am)/(1-m); substituting our known values obtained aboveforannwehave$amt/yearsofageafterthreeyafterthreetimepointswillbe am*(1-time)(amountaddedeachyrseleventheninewbornorretiredueagainfromschoolwhichaddtwentyplusfivekndollars&finalllymultiplyingitintofinalformequationgivesusresultforthusotheanshowsixteenfiftyfourthouregivenabove~howevertherearealotsandlotsofdifferentapproachesyoucouldalsousesuchasgraphicalmethodwhereyoudrawabarplotshowingshapeofthepopulationovertimespanydividedtototalareaundercurvebetweenaxislimitsthisshouldworkoutbetterifourrepresentdatawithnumbersratherthanwordslikewhenshownhereinthefirstimagebelowthenuwerightcalculateaveragenumberoffetchiountersinceitsonlyappliestomathematicsbasicallytheconceptfollowswhousesaveswhattheybuywhereseeaboveexamplebutimagineinsteadthatthesavetimeisdividedevenmoreproportionatelyacrossmultipleyearstoachievinganaggregatedvalueheresthatinthelaterpictureclick!okyeahillustratorgot itwronglettrynoticethingmustbesuperclearcutright??\r",

Substitute 'Y=9 into the equation above which yields \u201cAnn\u00b4s brother`s current Age\u201d=(9)*2. Hence, \"(ann_brothers_current_age)=(9)(2),\" or simply put as ann brothers current age equals twenty seven ((annaBrosCurrentAge)) Calculate what annual event occurs within three year period based off condition C('what_happens_in'). We understand this means add up thrity years onto ann ` brothers present ages.' Therefore , [(annaBrothersFutureYearAges)]='((annaBrosCurrentAge)+3)' Simplify calculation reveals : [ans]=\u2018[30]\u2019 .

        " 2 which says 'Her brother\u2019s present Age (B) equals 2 times less than three'. This would mean B = 2*Ann's Age or simply put, Brother's age equates to doubled value as per ann's existence time frame thus it stands 2*9=<<2*9=18>>18 years(b). To find out their ages ten steps into future; just add up 3 years to both values mentioned above i.e., adding yrs count ahead consequently making them respectively aged equaling to [ann+yrs_add] &[broth+yr]. From calculations this yields us An^9 year older being likewise adjustable within context hence coming down to resultant expression [(An)age^(year)+3]/[(Bro~)(age)^Year]+3]=((9)+3)/(18)+3)=(9+(3))/((18)+3),which simplifies down further getting our results yielded finally thereby obtaining calculated numerical answers equivalently denoting themselves namely ,final_result=[(current_answer)_left/(future_date+number),(last_value)/(next_calculation)];Final ",

Add those same three years off both people because everybody gets older over time! Using our result above this works out like so; [Brother Age future] = ([Current Yearly Total]+[Year Amount]) Resulting here [[Brother Age Future]]=([Ann](+9))+(Birthbrothersoldage(+3)) Simplifying further [(Result Of Prior Calc.)]. It ends up equaling [(Old Bros)(+yearspan)] . We can plug all variables into it without any work to find Outcome.. End ",
