        " get 42 + 48 = 90. To calculate the average, divide this sum into two (as only two people), which means averaging out over the same dimension \u2013 width or length. Therefore we pick one measure; I chose height here since it seems larger than usual units used otherwise because if you consider per row/column wise, Row would be bigger unit but not mentioned thus going with Columns(Length). Divide this overall count 90 across dimensions using 'length'. It results into ~4 rows/columns altogether considering individual sheets before being combined again. Calculate those extra columns resulting due when combining stackings separately like (first sheet+second=third) & similarly second+(last)=fourth.(i.e., We took first three individually)+ fourth(the last one joined all these four equals ninety hence getting sixteen equal parts divided amongst everyone.). Each person takes fifteen such shares making twentyfive rounds consumed equally among themselves! Finally come down till single consumption amounts matching within every category including quantity distribution equitably throughout different groups present during timeframe under scrutiny thereby ensuring transparency about what exactly happened concerning allocation process implemented based upon prior information disseminated earlier regarding objectives aimed targeting better resource management etc..

Dividing 190 by 2 equals seventy five therefore when dividing these equally you get equal amounts which mean fifty eight [fifty one plus four divided among two people] but since no fractional units are possible here it means everyone gets 58 food items minus what one person gobbled extra making him orher consume less like either 57 or 59 respectively depending whether you choose seven halves over whole ones if none went higher leaving only sixty six altogether.. But considering averages those numbers tend towards twenty three every other time around unless extreme cases happened such getting exactly half hundred even though its very unlikely compared against odd situations arising sometimes leading totals far above twenties mostly likely ending somewhere near mid tens range except maybe trippling digits rarely surpasses due human capacities regarding stomach size limitation etcetera Thus saying last resort options being ten thousand percent increase causing huge discrepancies beyond control resulting chaos thereby forcing authorities intervene eventually reaching consensus via mediation methods until agreeable outcomes reached agreement upon terms settle thus avoid future issues arise again further conflict resolution techniques employed till solution found acceptable ensuring peaceful coexistence henceforth forevermore Good Luck!
