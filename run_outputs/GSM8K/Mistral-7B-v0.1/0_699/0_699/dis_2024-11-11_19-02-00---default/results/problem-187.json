Solving this equation yields $6+$1=$7 increase resulting in overall payment made totals being $(the original balanced plus any increases brought about due to accruing compounded interests)[so we add up everything] meaning; Total Debt paid off becomes ($100 + $7), yielding finally [(summation calculated earlier)]=[total repaid], so therefore ultimately answering this question based upon our calculations thus far,(after simplifying calculation further): $100-$7=$93 remaining [Debt before collection]). Therefore following those steps correctly produces accurate values when solving linear equations relating variables within context provided:(as long as all conditions stated initially such as 'compound interest', etc., hold true throughout analysis). This means both terms inside brackets still stand unaltered[because no other changes occurred during time lapse]; hence showing relevance towards accuracy!
