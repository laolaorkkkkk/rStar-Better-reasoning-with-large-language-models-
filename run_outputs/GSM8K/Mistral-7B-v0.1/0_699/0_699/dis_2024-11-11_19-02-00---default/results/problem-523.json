But we still haven\u2019t accounted for all things happening afterwards ! Finally find out if any items showed up back because they couldn\u2019t stand being kept forever anymore \u2014that would mean returning them ; hence use addition instead multiplication/division here ,because adding isn't impacting what you already counted off before ..... so it works like :-..

However, considering the fact that one more batch was involved when someone brought back six unwanted goods\u2014in case it hasn\u2019t already happened earlier\u2014we need add those back too; so finally having only 62 remaining goodies overall or simply put as the correct equation would look like follows \u2013 [(total product)*initial percentage]*subtraction operation (+ addition due returns); i.e., [200*x-(93+39)+6]=final_amount=62 . Where 'X' represents their proportionate distribution over time but since our aim here seems primarily focusing upon quantitative information about products rather than percentages per se,' X', hence can also directly represent raw numbers just without adding any fractional division factor thus reducing complexity.

Applying values you get; -200-. Subtracting morining sale results into -200+(-39)= (-). Adding back the remaining stock through returns means adding ((-)-6), thus ending up with result value((-)).
