Which helps explain better perhaps why investors choose long term gains rather short run ones depending upon various circumstances surrounding individuals too making decisions involving financial aspects related toward fun events/activities associated mostly amongst adult friends particularly those wanting maximum returns possible whilst still enjoying themselves amidst other experiences possibly offered via certain venues providing amusement options combined together seamlessly alongside themes relevant backdrop background scenery environments often present everywhere around cities especially urban metropolises populated predominantly younger generations alike who seek entertainment diversification beyond traditional mainstream media content including television shows streaming channels radio stations blogging platforms video game titles online matured forms movies action adventure documentaries news updates articles literature publications journals scholarly writings textbooks educational materials etc., videos internet podcast music lyrics songs albums compilation compilations mixtapes singles tracks interviews conversations dialogue exchanges debates arguments disputes disagreements negotiations compromises discussions dealership agreements contracts partnerships employers employees supervisors managers team leaders coach trainers instructors mentors counselors parents teachers educators professors advisers research scientists analyst developers design engineers innovation entrepreneurs creatives artists performers composers conductors directors stagehand technicians sound system operators lighting crew members camera equipment staff drivers mechanic automobiles airplanes ships trucks motorcycles bicycles skateboards surfboards rollerblades snowboard helmets boots sunglasses hats scarves gloves socks shoes pants jumpsuits shirts blouses bras",
        " round trip (there & back) across all the 9 attractions takes about 1 minute or roughly half hour approximately if we assume average time spending around attraction could vary but as general rule let\u2019s say one third hours/ride i.e., three minutes times six equals eighteen seconds for calculating our calculations here since fractions usually add up quickly). Therefore when visiting only once instead thrice ,we divide this fraction into quarterly intervals resulting within thirty six separate occurrences; thus making every single journey equal ten eight second increments long meaning altogether seventy four identical duration experiences cumulatively amount totalling twenty seven point nineteen thousandseven hundred sixty twelve secs overall before factorinhg these sums collectively due pto calculate exact expenses associated therefore considering such minutiae becomes necessary especially concerning smaller amounts involved thereby influencing prices accordingly .

Well, since one round trip already cost both $36 ($2*2ticket+transportation=$36), even though it doesn\u2019t count here, but let\u2019s consider it anyways, this means once having spent almost half their way, namely ~$36-$18=~$18; no matter what amount remains \u2014 either everything ends up spending around another same value or just not enough coins etc., while David still ended paying only slightly under double such rounded price sum (=<~$18). As I guessed above most likely because transportations aren\u2019t cheap being calculated via cash/money itself anyway & assuming these could work somehow alongside said items like walkable paths themselves ; thus providing free useability factor \u2013 although sometimes those actually exist too however rarely\u2026 But basically nothing special happened outside common sense logic..

        " would have been $30 (bracelet) + $18 (tickets) = $48 if one rode each time separately. Because when using either method \u2013 having purchased together or individually - results in only paying once for entry into these attractions regardless whether it was used up completely; therefore no savings happened due merely purchasing collectively nor splitting them differently among themselves over three sessions within said duration\u2014they\u2019d still expend identical sums across their personal transactions whilst sharing same benefits via shared equipment/entry fees provided under uniform price point agreed upon beforehand amongst parties involved thus making sense economically sound practice concerning pricing discrimination based purely on individual demand factors rather than overall volume acquired while ensuring equitable access opportunities available throughout entirety offered experiences thereby fostering positive mutual relationship dynamics during enjoyment phase henceforth occurring sequentially without any subsequent monetary discrepancies emerging later down road post indulgence proceeding immediately following acquisition procedures initiated herein outlined above including relevant taxation elements associated accordingly pursuant directives specified previously cited specifically denoting pertinent financial parameters applied universally indiscriminately irrespective particular transaction types encountered uniquely experienced solely confined strictly respectively distinct circumstances implicated singularly specificity dictations otherwise potentially resulting non conformative compliance issues arising subsequently attendant punitive measures corresponding applicable reparations rendered consequently imposed retrospectively albeit prospectively preventable courtesy proactive efforts preemptive anticipatory adjustments undertaken predicatively ahead future occurrence ensuingly averting needless inconvenience inflicted unwarranted afflictions unduly amplifying adversarial sentiments unnecessarily escalating negative connotations surrounding relationships cultivated ultimately engendered untoward feelings affecting interpersonal interactions detrimentally influencing rapport development negligibly sabotaging amicably harmonious bonds sustaining friendship premise essential basis fortification solidarizing companionship consolidatim intimately aligning interests collaborativem working jointly maximizum potential fully leveraging complimentary respective skills unique attributes advantages complement ingenuously advantageous synergistic blending optimality generating maximum result efficacy efficiency profits economic gain fiscal prosperity beneficial outcome cumulative yield reciprocl virtue exchange symbiotic association communial cooperative endeavors commodifc integration diversified portfolio inclusivity universal welfare holistich compreh",
        " (Dasha) = $48. But if we divide this equally among themselves since they rode together it would split into half i.e.,$24 for both combined while one needs just to get through single entry . Therefore ,we could say here amount saved :($48-$24). Let us check another option too   Buying separately means firstly calculating what\u2019d happen without discounting; as mentioned before its going to take equal part when splitting amongst equals henceforth lets find out about those numbers alone ....We know their common route consisted upto n=total numbberofridesortickestotrywhichisgivenasninthesequentiallyticketcosttotrisewitheachrideiinthepresentcircumstancessoitwillbepertainingtothemuchthattheyhavepaidthroughoneentrytoaccessalltheridesandthisamountwouldthenactuallybecostcalculatedbasedonwhattherepurchaseshadbeentooftomanyatkeepsawayfrompaymentsystemicallyaccordingstowhetherspecificationshadtodecideupontheverythingouthere ;hereshowitsdone :-firstpartoconsiderateveryexpensiveoptionalsubscriptionsinvolvedlikerabdracewhereyoucantavoidmostpricesamongindievenifnotchosencomicantlybetteryetfancyeroptionssuchabroaderbraincastaincalled\"unlimitedridestealerdeal\".nowletsassumetwoways:-a)-regularwaysposiblywhengoingwithoutsubscriptionjustacase:(*)$(x+ y )/z=(2+3)/2=$2.5 ($2+$3/2)=$5.-(- b))highendservice&benefitsprovidedwhile subscribing(:$(x+y)+ z*(u%v=%)(*$4*(9/$3)*((/(lhjklmnoppqrrttuvwwxyzzza))))<=>~$12:$18.$savedamtionsomethingaround$:~$<<--->>(~)==>(>>---$$2-->++-+=-$-----$\\underline{So \\ overall }=\\frac{$5}{}$\\Rightarrow \\$1\\\\text{---------}$$^[$solution] Hence your result seems wrong because $\\frac {RoundOff}(X)}{\\frac{(X)}{Z}}= $$ RoundOff(\\frac{TotalCostOfAverageExpensiveness"
