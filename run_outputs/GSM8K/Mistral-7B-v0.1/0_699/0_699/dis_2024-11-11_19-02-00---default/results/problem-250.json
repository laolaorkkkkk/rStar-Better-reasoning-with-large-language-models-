From above, if it stated equally split among males and females i.e., 'the school being 50% boys and 50% Girls', hence equal distribution means both genders would take up half the student population since their presence rate within the organization remains balanced. Let us consider calculated no.of total_students which equals 60to calculate gender representation Male Representation=(Total_Males /Overall_Population)*Percentage represented when converted into decimal form Making use of numbers derivedfrom earlier equations ,wehave=> Overall Gender Population Balance=((Girls+Boys)/TotaLpopulatioN)(which holds true for any percentage expressedin termsofdecimal fraction). Thus making appropriate substitution ; (NumberOfGirls+(number of Boys))/(overal populations*)i.e,( Number of girl studens)+(boystudents)*convertingpercantageinto decimals ((DecimalEquivalentofthepercentvalueforboys*(number oifgirl studients+no\u200c\u200btombstudents)*dividedtotala\u00a0popularities*nowhereitcanbe saidthatmorespecificlycalculated value whilkextendedbelowiszeroornegativenumbersnotsuitablerepresentaionsinceitsabsurditywiththetotalcountingandthenumberboughteachtimewereplantedonothatcouldstoptractableandscaleneededsolutionsthereforeaslovedegeneratorsareleftoutinthelimitcasewherebothsexistinoffloatpointyvalues..!),male popuationaldistribution can bededucedbasedonthewholeanalysisdonepreviousthatresultshavetofollowgenderbalanceremainingafterallocationsignifyingnumerosubtractionscasewhenoneadditionmadeleftermostnaturalsecondarilyalteredequivalentypositivevaluesequentlychangingformbetweenopposingconditionseithernegativeanbdifferentperspectivesneedbeterminedundervariouscircumstancesapplyingcorrectmathmaticaloperationsconsistingdifferenciationalternativeassessmentpossiblyincludingotherfactors",
        " classes combined. Since it\u2019s mentioned each student could either be boy or girl equally likely which means half of them would be boys. Therefore we can state \u2013 Total No Boys=Total Students/2; Thus \u2013 NumberofBoysinfirstTwoClasses=(NumberofStudentsInFirstClass+NumberofStudentsInSecondClass)/2 ; Hence ,NoOfBoysintheSchool=(TotalNoBogirlsfromallclasses)+(totalnumberoffirstandsecondclassboys)=((totalno_students)-twofistclasselems)+ ((total_boysofthird_class)).
