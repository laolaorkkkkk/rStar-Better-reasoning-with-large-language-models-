Subtract these values: subtract $1,000 from $1,100 which leaves you with difference of $100 being earned because switching over production lines so farms can grow food for people around them was worth it even though their profits went down during those first few weeks. It took about four months before sales reached previous levels again as reported here \u2013 although one reason this may not mean things look good right away could involve having less employees who didn\u2019t like working new jobs instead\u2013or perhaps wanting different wages\u2026even if most folks agree changes need changing!
