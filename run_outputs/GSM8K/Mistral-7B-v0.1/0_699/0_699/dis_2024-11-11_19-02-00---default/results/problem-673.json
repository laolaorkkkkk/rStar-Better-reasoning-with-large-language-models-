Subtracting three would leave ((2*Book_count) - 3) which equals Janey's count i.e., 21. Therefore Book Count(x)=((21+3)/2). Solving further results x=12/2 or  6 . So, Sally has 6 Books. This solution was derived considering basic algebra rules applicable here hence not requiring mathematical operations like division etc but rather simple algebraic manipulations using properties provided leading towards simplification till arriving at straightforward expression resulting interpretation based upon known value replacement ultimately evaluating numerical multiplication followed immediately by subtraction operation involving same integer values enabling instant calculation without resort to complex computation steps.

        " effectively 21 - 3 = 18 which represents 'twice as many books'. To find out exactly what Sally's count would represent (since it was half), just divide this result by 2. Hence, doubled again becomes approximately  18 / 2 = 9. However since every book can\u2019t actually exist in fractions so when considering whole numbers; if we take back one extra from earlier doubling makes sense here .i.e.,   18/2 \u2013\u202fone more equals to **9+1** , meaning sally therefore owns around **10 books**.. But looking closely our original equation signifies \u2018three more\u2019 thus adjusting once gets us towards accurate amount say **(9)x2=18 plus another three amounts up totalling ~**~[*((approximate)*)+('more')]*~~ -> 21 or basically **the quantity being thrice lesser compared to Janey***\u2026 making equal distribution i assume yields about **~[(total minus janey)/remaining parts] =~ [(-1*(doubleten))/(2])]_approx_ => [-(*(18)/*)](-(thirdcount))] =~ [(\"six\" fewer counts divided equally amongst remaining \"*two\")],-> [(total\u2014janey),(lessCountDividedByTwo)] =~ (*([totalsubtraction],[finalDistributionApproach]))_.

Here, instead twos being doubled firstly before adding three (as implied), it actually involves doubling afterwards which leads us back to correctly concluding initially having just one operation involved leading eventually causing confusion.
