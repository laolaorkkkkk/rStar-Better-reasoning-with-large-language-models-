Since running requires optimal physical fitness; we can expect these results (a result improvement) when considering them as whole person improvements (and not only just body changes). Thus if Leonard initially took X amount less than what was asked him here above...X=the difference bwghting without any change made up through proper food consumption etc.. Before all other things happened during those times mentioned earlier about Leonard having gained weight(i), muscle growth occurred also because increasing your overall strength helps improve athletic abilities such distance events hence leading someone who didn\u00b4t previously compete well enough against others perform excellently afterwards despite being overweight but still managing himself correctly towards achieving best outcomes possible based upon available resources regardless how limited said scenario becomes depending entirely upon individual circumstances related specifically toward personal health factors influencing one`s potential outcome according whatever criteria applied under particular situation faced either directly personally or indirectly causing consequences otherwise unintended perhaps affective emotional responses experienced later down road caused primarily owning resulting actions carried out whenever decisions taken pursuant intention intended ultimately aimed reaching set desired targets fulfill aspired ideals achievable goals successfully accomplished desirable objectives attained sought satisfactions obtained realized hopes actualized dreams turned into realities thus achieved successes happiness brought contentment satisfaction joyful delight gratification pleasure accomplishments victories glory honor pride dignity respect deference humility courtesy politeness gracious amiability genial benevolence goodwill friendship amity camaraderie companionship fellowship concord brotherhood fraternity fidelity faithful obedience loyalty honesty integrity virtue sincerity trust faith belief devotion commitment dedication allegiance constancy duty solemnity serious concern earnest zeal vigor determination resolve courage grit tenacity hard work diligence persistence patience forbearance kindness generosity charity humanitarianism service community spirit solidarity unity teamwork cooperation partnership collaboration harmony peace accord understanding sympathy empathy pity feeling mercy reconciliation forgiveness penance apology justice fair dealing ethical conduct responsible accountability responsibility obligations moral values high morality excellent behavior exemplary comportment noble conduct grace civility reverence holy holiness sanctity righteousness innocent simplicity purity modesty meekness lowliness submission submissiveness gentleness tolerance composure tranquility calm serenity mellow softness",

We round this off because we cannot measure fractions of second accurately enough here; so if we consider whole numbers only, it comes out as around halfway through another full . Second i.e., approximately one additional 'second'.

        " 38 seconds, but earlier we calculated this as being only 2 seconds slower than Gerald's original time (before any changes). Therefore, without considering the new improvement due to Dietary modifications mentioned later on, since one second less equated roughly about equaling half or slightly over a minute difference (Gerald took ~19 minutes instead), if the same proportion applied here too i.e.,  2 secs representing just under/over a min means perhaps around similar timings could apply, meaning **approximately** when comparing speeds initially , so maybe take away the extra fractional part resulting off 'half way', leaving us approximations like possibly close values such as : ***nearly*** what value might you suggest ? Let\u2019s first understand the relationship using proportions based solely on timing differences rather initial times.
