James used the cart from 5 PM (which we can consider 'hour zero') until 9 PM ('fourth hour'), but because he received one free hour during this time, effectively only three hours worth of usage count towards payment. Therefore, for these three charged hours, he would need to calculate his total bill as follows: One third initially costing him full price ($15) plus two times tripled prices; thus resulting into ((1/3)*$15)+((2*($15*2)))+($30). This equals out onto [(5)]+$60+$30=$95. Hence, considering both additional charges applied alongside excluding any initial credit earned due to using it outside operating timings hence unavailable within calculation context, the sum expended was calculated without applying benefits or reductions related thereto amount totalling up to $. Thus accordingly equipping such values mentioned above through relevant calculations performed previously presented hereinabove concludes resultant financial outcome yielding value designated as '$95'.

        " free hour equals 8 charged hours. Every subsequent hour costs double so it goes like this : second hour $(15*2), third hour ($15*2^2), fourth hour ($15*2^3) etc... To get the sum we can use formula S_n=a*(r^N - 1)/(r-1). Here N = (end index - start index )+1; r = multiplication factor per period i.e price here ; a = starting amount or value . Substituting these values into our equation above , since every indexed element/term needs its own calculations as well when using geometric sequence progression formulas one way around could include adding up individual terms individually before finally calculating their total .. That said let us simplify things considering only n consecutive elements such as {third} until{(sixth)} ie next three sequential charges being calculated simultaneously but remember no matter what approach used all results would still yield same output !!!
