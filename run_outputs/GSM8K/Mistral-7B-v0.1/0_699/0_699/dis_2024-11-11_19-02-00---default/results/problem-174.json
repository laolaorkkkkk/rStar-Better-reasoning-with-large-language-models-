This comes out as approximately 90 minutes or equivalently 1 hour and 30 minutes ((1/2)*60*60) since he spends 1.5 hours peeling every single potato which totals into around 90 mins [(1 min(for chopping)/potato)(number of Potatos)]=90mins , this means pealing process alone would require him almost full working day . However, the question also mentioned 'cutting them', hence another operation might not significantly increase overall duration due because its speed considerably higher than peeling i.e.,  5 seconds per piece compared to ~240 seconds (~minutes depending upon if we round off fractional parts), implying additional delay mainly attributable primarily towards longer action required initially during prep phase rather being compounded substantially over subsequent proceedings based purely temporal comparisons derived directly & independently from primary data points provided implicitly within contextual premises underpinning original query itself thereby rendering secondary operations largely irrelevant when strictly quantitatively appraising cumulative requisite elapse encompassing core activity components necessitated collectively summon individual constituents integral construct mandatory completion culminative endeavour entail holistic engagement both initial extraction yet persisting continuum till ultimate terminus effectuated ensuring comprehensive fulfillment task purposefully ordained executed flawlessly irrespective potential nuances may intrigue induce slight augmentations marginally extant thus transcending rudimentary juxtapositions mere numerics disregard complexities subtlety embedded actual undertaking execution reality embracing meticulousness precision essentiality exactitude ultimately consummate triumph deliverance result product desired aspiration realized achieved outcome realisation accomplished successfully navigated challenges encountered surmounted obstacles overcome concluding success story complete narrative unfolding harmonious cooperation collaboration efficacious teamwork shared goal objective target aim direction focus commitment dedication hard work effort sweat sacrifice results reward accomplishments celebration victory glory achievement honor honour praise commendation respect accord recognition appreciation gratitude acknowledgment thanksgiving festival feast banquet gala party occasion special dinner gathering meal breakfast brunch snack treat delightful dessert fun enjoyable le",

Cutting needs just 5 seconds every single piece since all potatoes require equal effort. Multiply these times against the quantity; therefore, peeling would altogether consume around 60 * 90 which equals 5,400 seconds or 1 hour and 30 minutes if not rounded off due to precision loss while converting large numbers into appropriate units ('minutes'). Similarly, chopping totals approximately 60*5 equalling  300 seconds or precisely three rounds of ten 'billionth steps', virtually nil when compared with prior results yet crucial enough nevertheless regarding accurate computation accuracy!

        " seconds per potato. Cutting takes 5 seconds per potato. Each whole process (peeling and cutting) therefore requires 90+5=95 seconds. Since we need these tasks performed twice (once while peeling and once during cutting), this doubles our necessary work period to 95*2=190 seconds needed in order to handle all items effectively under optimal conditions without interruptions or downtime such as switching tools mid task etcetera.. Thus , let s assume average speeds here since different types could lead to variations ..so overall timing would typically fall somewhere around avg speed taking us back down closer toward .

Alright enough complaining lets figure out those minutes ...and if u want full precision use actual decimal form ;) Doing math above : Total Time Avg Speed Possible Scenario Minutes Took Round Up Second Place / Sec Per Mins ^^ Right ",

Therefore, even though I calculated above based purely mathematical principles without factoring any other activity such as rest periods during cooking etc., your statement holds quite true assuming no interruptions occur while working continuously since repetitive manual jobs usually tend towards slower pace due its monotony despite technically being less demanding cognitively compared single task scenarios requiring mental processing skills over extended period hence warrant extra caution not getting burnout faster unless well managed efficiently within realistic human capabilities ensuring optimal performance maintain overall balance especially around intense events involving people regardless their age group providing necessary care accordingly catering special attention according situation specific requirements optimizing efforts leveraging suitable methods achieving desired result benefitting others positively enhancing shared experiences amongst everyone involved thereby maximizing potential gains made throughout collaborative interactions contributing significantly towards collective goal attainment whilst reinforcing values integral essential foundation societal structure promoting cooperation solidarity harmonious relationships conducive environments fostering creativity innovation leading growth development progress uphold ethos inspiring ideals perpetuated generational success propagate righteous behavior cultivating virtuous individuals empowered equipped capable facing life challenges headstrong determined resolve unwaveringly committed dedicated purpose directed focus harness fullest utilization talents abilities aspirations dreams goals set clear intentional pathway accomplish mission realize ambitions seize opportunities embrace possibilities reach destinies actualize fulfilled contentedly appreciate grateful acknowledgment express humbled gratitude thankful satisfaction sense achievement worthiness meriting admiration esteem earning respect garner acclaim recognition deserving commend appreciation praise adulation celebratory honorific dignified homage grandiloquent laudable glory glorification hallowed venerated reverence august regal majestic exalt prestigious stately illustrious distinguished noble high regard honour lofty prestige nobility royal court aristocratic elite privileged select circle elevated social rank honored title kn",

To find out how much faster this process saves him per potato once both actions combined, we subtract the shorter action time from the longer action time: 1.5 min/potato \u2013 5 sec/potato.
