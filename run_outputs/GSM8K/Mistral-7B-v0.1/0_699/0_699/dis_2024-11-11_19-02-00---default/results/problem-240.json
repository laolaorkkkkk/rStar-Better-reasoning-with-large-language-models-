        " as Robert. That means he has  2 times (or double) what Robert has which equals   2*54 = 108 candies. Finally identify who possesses fewest or most candies among them all. Here we can see both John\u2019s possession(candy), i.e., 108 candy & james possessance(candie) , i.e,. 60 . Find out difference in their positions based on quantity of candies possessed. Since John holds highest amount namely \u2018108 candies,\u2019 our main target here remains only him minus whatever lesser amount someone/something else hold[i]as least. It refers just those whose count differs when it comes towards comparison against this high position holder [John]. Thus; comparing any candidate other entity having lower stashing capacity won\u2018t make us reach desired results while going beyond max.[ii][iii](This logic applies till individual unit counting upwardly). Consider such condition like finding out whether somebody surpasses others due being ahead enough until nobody stands behind another single person beside oneself self except if its about ourselves too !

Since we know that John owns exactly fourteen additional amounts relative to those possessed by Robert(i.e., twenty-seven), this implies both Robert\u2019s collection equals twelve while James possesses six quantities less which makes him come up equaling one unit lower i.e. eleven units. Thus the solution calls us into action; comparing Jane\u2019s holding against John would imply seventeen points since their possession sums yield fifty minus eighteen or only seven extra items within them respectively.(For example, if James held three bundles whereas John boasted ten bags, it means John holds precisely eightfold greater collections). This outcome indicates you hold fifteen excessively richer contents over your rival unless all individuals accumulate every single piece under their control before any comparison arises!

Replacing accordingly gets us..*x*(n)*(j*)((a))*=(27)+(-6) ->or better read simply...==>(27+=-6)--->which simplified further equals::=> **X**(*NASA astronaut Andy Mccain*) => **Andy McCain** And thus ..we find out exactly who NASA astronaut Johnny Walker was supposedly referring to throughout all their space conversations , I would assume! :) But don't ask me why its being mentioned since i myself personally dont subscribe nor agree strongly towards believing any conspiracy theories around Space / Astronomy topics whatsoever!!
