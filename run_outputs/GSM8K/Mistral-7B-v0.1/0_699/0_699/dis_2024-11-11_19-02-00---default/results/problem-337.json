        " dogs (as per instruction) as it was mentioned 'three times more'. Thus, when compared to Thomas, we see this statement written wrongly because if lucy who initially consumed 2 food items would triple them later, not six but rather 2*3=6 so it could only mean twice their current consumption hence according to actual wordings, It can also denote simply thrice or double i.e., either way incorrect mathematically since no context suggests multiplication which leads us down such paths Hence based off available info Lucia indeed still consumes merely those same 2 original ones while Thomas doubles thus ingests another set making him overall consume 2+2=4 etc... Meanwhile, our target figure regarding John remains concealed within these dialogue frames yet intriguing nonetheless having emerged right alongside me earlier hinting towards one part being misinterpreted suggesting instead simple subtraction aligning back into literal interpretation viz.; Lucy herself starts out & ends up wielding none leaving everyone else equally culpable whilst bearing minimal difference itself unless redefining said query further through additional variables implying incremental increments throughout sequence execution/consumption process..

        " so he ate 3*2=6. Therefore, together, they (Thomas & Luke) ate 6+2 = 8 hot dogs altogether. Meanwhile, John only ate half as many hotdogs as Thomas ate which means Jhon ate 6/2 = 3 hot dogs less than Luke himself alone because when you subtract what John took form their combined sum it results into this figure. Finally, we can conclude that Luke ended up consuming fewer hot dogs since if compared against him individually, Johnson managed just one single piece shortfall; hence concluding towards our aimful solution set forth within these words herein presented \u2013 i..e., \u201cJohn consumed precisely \u2018three\u2019(a singular entity count); juxtaposedly positioning oneself beside Lucas whose own consumption tallies reached nearer toward double digits\u2014thus making evident why such numerical delineation came about\u201d. Consequently stated numerically translated via English interpretation would best fit under option b )Three .

We need one figure stating who devoured fewer meals out of Jordan or Joshua whose numbers differ because we find subtraction useful here. Hence according to what was asked this could mean subtracting luke's intake so it goes like this;(three minus just lesser value)-two hence result would turn up towards positive values i.e.; Positive Number Here you may note down both figures required but since all arithmetic operations stated above resulted negative outputs while our request insisted upon having exclusive positives therefore these equations don\u2019t satisfy criteria specified rather suggest doing calculations through negation resulting exclusively over positive quantities such joshue(-jordan)+luke=exclusive_positives.

We need also find out about Jacob i.e., J; we know, \u201cJohn (j ) only took one lesser part\u201d which implies j<t but due to lacking data, here assuming equal division among both kids like what happened when LKA divided them equally into their respective halves without calculating any individual value thus J becomes 3 hence simplifying our problem, this assumes BOTH received equitable shares while sharing something irrespective or not depending upon anyone else who could interfere either negatively OR positively . Therefore solving further yields no specific difference obtained over another unless someone takes additional action resulting/interfering wihtout providing clarification otherwise leaving everyone guessing! Hence my deduction goes against such conditions requiring explicit mention during calculation itself because nobody except oneself would ever make assumptions based solely upon limited info available before proceedings commenced thereby ensuring absolute precision & accuracy throughout every stage until conclusion arises finally reflecting true scenario precisely following correct methodology employed till outcome manifest..

Let me spell everything backwards sometimes helps catch mistakes here ; if Nate can see Luceeats minus Tomauses THEN ?

Subtracting these values yields  6 \u2013 2 so as per comparison Luca finished first. Thus answering your question about who among them required most time; it\u2019ll require maximum seconds i.e. second place=Thomas hence solving our problem..
