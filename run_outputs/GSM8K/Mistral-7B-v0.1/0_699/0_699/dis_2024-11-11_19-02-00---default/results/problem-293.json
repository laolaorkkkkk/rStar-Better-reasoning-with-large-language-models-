Combine these numbers together along with Jim\u2019s unchanged count which was first established as 'Jim=18', summing up you find: Total_points='Mike+Jim+Tony=\"(22)+(18)+(43)\"'.

Because initially sum of these friend was found as not divisible using Euclidean algorithm so it doesn\u2019t apply here but adding \u2018extra\u2019 credit rules make this scenario possible. Hence resulting totals would increase accordingly thereby making our desired solution applicable within context based numerical constraints mentioned previously iii).

        " individual before applying this new condition: We know Mike scored 21; thus we apply it as follows: Tony who played twice better than Mike scores (2*21) equaling 42; whereas since Jack\u2019s team won only one match against Tomas\u00b4 team outright so far ,he plays another full year while remaining consistent both offensively(scoring goals/games ratio), defensively(goalkeepers stats). This allows him not having any loss records under these circumstances assuming minimal goal differential standards considering high difficulty opponents without fouls conceded leading towards statistical consistency overall despite being behind schedule compared previously during season openings dueo lower level matches faced initially when starting competition phases earlier within development stage advancement period across various skill levels representing different leagues globally throughout time continuum progression cycle initiated primarily focusing efforts toward improving respective areas lacking competitive edge based upon internal performance assessments conducted through comprehensive evaluations utilizing advanced technological tools including but not limited specifically machine learning algorithms combined analytics software platforms designed expressly tailored explicitly developed exclusively created solely dedicated purposefully intentionallily engineered constructed specifically crafted singularity unparalleled uniqueness offering unique capabilities unlike anything existing anywhere currently known outside realms beyond earth ensuring absolute certainty concerning future trends expected developments anticipated emergence forthcoming revolutionary breakthrough opportunities providing enlightenment illuminating bright path forward facilitating accelerated progress speed increasing efficiency effectiveness optimization potential achievements yet await destined eventual outcome regardless predictable timing actual occurrence scenario predetermined result guarantee fulfilling promised commitment abiding pledge obligation met expectation fully accomplish task assigned completion responsibility complete job execution effectively thoroughly satisfying client satisfaction maximized revenue generation profitability boost productivity elevated quality service offer provided excellent customer experience delivered exceedingly impressive results performed superbly executed flawlessly accomplished perfectly completed effortlessly seamless operation smooth running system optimal functionality efficient work process streamlined workflow improved procedures enhance production output increased yield higher return investment capital expense saved cost savings achieved saving operational efficiencies reducing waste minimizing losses curtail disruptions mitigating issues prevent delays resolving problems eliminating challenges overcoming obstacles circumvent hurdles avoid impediments steering clear trouble ahead planning strategy implementing changes management improvements implementation decisions innovative ideas creativity spark inspiring motivation encouragement morale uplifting spirits energize enthusiasm",

        " scored above 20 (Mike & Tony). Finally, calculate their combined scores afterwards. Initially, Mike has 21 points. Thus, according to our task, both Mike and Tony get one additional bonus because they exceed 'over 20'. Hence we add these 2 bonuses, making it 23+2=25 and keep them as they already surpassed the threshold needed to earn those extras during earlier stages without changing anything about existing quantities! Consequently considering previous results which were calculated based upon original totals only \u2013 so thus leading us into concluding part; since none was explicitly provided under this situation hence neither adjustments nor deductions required any further calculations beyond what had previously occurred within established confines hereof therefore following suit accordingly ensures accurate representation relative towards achieving desired resolution whilst maintaining fidelity toward authenticated processes involved thereby preserving integral values inherently embodied forthwith corresponding specifically thereto particular contextual necessities encompassable inclusively while concurrently abiding strictly adherent veracity constraints universally prevailingly extant throughout respective jurisdictions pertaining applicable regulations stipulated implicitly otherwise explicatively articulate pertinent clauses germane directly correlative intrinsic merits emanating contemporarily irrefutably manifest visibly palpably readily observable tangibly discernible distinctly immediately unequivocally demonstrably unmistakably clearly obviously absolutely evidently definitively categorically undeniably definitely most certainly indubitably affirmatively positively indeed assuredly finally conclusively accurately precisely correctly right totally entirely perfectly wholeheartedly completely fully wholly ultimately utterly exactly thoroughly holistically exhaustively comprehensively essentially sincerely genuinely honestly naturally authentically altogether basically fundamentally truly properly eventually necessarily initially invariably primarily decisively progressively additionally ordinarily subsequently somewhat almost consequentially significantly broadly overall generally substantially temporarily momentarily extensively presently simultaneously intermittently briefly later largely instantaneously swiftly particularly strongly vigorously slightly repeatedly not especially moderately constantly intensely quickly shortly consistently increasing rapidly incrementally gradually steadily sporadically rhythmically sequentially frequently regularly routinely repetitiously systematically cyclically circularly uniformly even occasionally perpetually periodically periodic permanently transiently irregularly randomized randomly alternately oscillating eccentrically erratic accidentally infrequently anomalously episodically erratically rec",
        " first sentence tells us that mike scored exactly 21 so we add only him one additional point. We don't need this information anymore. Let\u2019s start counting up! First find out what jim scores using the information provided in your question (subtraction). You subtract JIM_MIKE=1 which corresponds with 'jim having 3 points less'. This calculation makes it easy to count directly because its already expressed as such `mike minus`. With these calculations you can calculate TONY too since he always earns twice as high as MIKE no matter how many points he made himself. Multiplying both sides here means taking away nothing but changing numbers into percentage signs:`tony equals(multiply)(mike)` or `(two)(twentyone)`. When calculating further multiply them together; Two\u00d7TwentyOne=(TwoXTen)+((TimesTwo))+(LastNumber) . That leads us through multiplications: Twice ten plus twelve. Therefore twentypointzero+twelve.. Finally when dividing everything among ourselves adds again lead`fourteen+threeandseventeenin[sixty]to make sixty seven.`Now lets see about everyone else making their own marks.Mike starts off leading with just enough difference compared to any other friend.(Compare):FourPointEightequalsMinusSevenDividedByNineDividing four divided by negative Seven isn't possible!(Try without negativeness),so i flipped Negative SevensidewayswhiledividingtothetwosidesixteenthOf FourHencewhencalculationstartupsoftwoofninetiesquaredisalwaysremainingwhichcorrespondsto\"minus twentythree\".Soaddithesevenpointsontopollistgivingmikethirtyfive.Nextcomesjeffrey whose scoringwas mentioned earlier(`takeaway`)i foundhimgettingaTotalAmountequalToThreeminusthreescoreAndAnintensivestodrawfrommyworkfirstforsomeintegertricksbutsecondilydidntlikeittherewhereafteraddingmoreupontopallfriendscorelistsbringingtogetheralotofextrainformationleadingmefurtherasthefinaltotalamountwhathasbeenoadedovereveryplayerwillbecircumsumeratedamongacrosstheboardoncecompletewithdrawingsoughtfornewlistitemshichstillshowsinvolvespreviouslymentionedintegersbecausenow"
