Since only one third remains due to selling off all other quantities over three time intervals(evening), it can henceforth deduced that exactly half these are distributed evenly into both afternoons and evenings together i.e., half would equal the quarter portion per interval because their distribution happens across four parts rather than just two as might initially appear.(Remember: when something like \u2018half divided among n things,\u2019 you actually divide it evenly \u2013 not simply cut its entirety into halves.)

        " 60) or about 20 loaves remaining throughout the whole day. Half of this amount means exactly 20 / 2 which equals to 10 Loaves would thus mean roughly around them being divided into three parts; so if we divide these ten evenly among all selling times i.e., equal amounts per time slot...the answer becomes approximately 3 & one third.(not exact.) Therefore it seems like only part(about 1 out of those approximate values mentioned above), but since you asked specifically 'afternoon', here comes our conclusion! To put simply \u2013 yes, less than fourteen loaves get distributed overnight before opening doors until noon as most customers prefer breakfast fare first thing\u2014they want good things when fresh still warm too right\u2026which makes sense considering human nature itself isn't completely predictable nor always rational.. :) .
