Finally substracting those few dozen extras leaves us only counting out the white parts. We know all remaining whites equal twelve less overall counts therefore making their exact quantity... let me figure if I missed anything first but i feel like its probably around forty something right maybe exactly fifty minus twelve.. would bring our possible guess down here somewhere into the late twenties range though most likely rounder low thirty oddness perhaps due to whole numbers being involved could get slightly murky thinking back further\u2026 however im guessing within half decades again possibly mid sixties or early seventies interval without seeing any specific value yet myself although both still seem reasonable enough based upon typical human experience etc anyway considering what information was provided earlier regarding color distribution according common sense logic people usually tend toward preferring certain hues over others generally speaking thus choosing mainly either dark shades whereas light seems somewhat unappealing sometimes especially compared against bright primary palette choices hence resulting quite naturally towards selecting mostly black/grey clothing items thereby reducing visual contrast greatly increasing needlessly distractive focusing points rather significantly impair vision accordingly restrict ability see clearly otherwise essential things going wrong happening behind scenes besides obvious potential eye strain headaches fatigue anxiety levels stress high pressure situations causing difficulty maintain focus sustain proper concentration effort required intense mental workload necessary demanding increased attention span lengthier processing times needed greater amount accuracy achieved lower quality output produced faster reduction efficiency productivity rate improvement desired outcome reduced performance suffered worse experiences encountered frequently occurrences unlikely occurrence rare event occurred unexpected sudden change immediate reaction quick decision swift action rapid result direct cause casual relationship clear connection evident evidence strong correlation tight association solid bond close partnership firm alliance binding contract obligation mutually agreed terms fair dealing ethical practice safe harbor regulation safeguarding rights interests protection guidelines governing procedures applicable rules enforced standards compliant behavior ensuring accountability responsible actions taking care personal property belongings valuables valuable assets possessions earnings financial income wealth accumulated capital investments savings accounts deposits stock shares equ",
        " means it has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. And it has 12 fewer white squares than green squares; this would mean 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. To find out the size of the entire comforter we add all those up: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white). This equals 68 squares or cubic feet because every one foot counts as both length/breadth measure since their dimensions remain unaltered but only count once due to being stacking dimension when calculating area(surface), hence resulting in a cumulative figure representative of sqft rather than cuft calculation basis surface determination.

This would mean that since these counts include any other amount above our initial count due to having 'more', or subtracting below because you say 'fewer', it works best as simply starting over again every time while continuously adjusting based upon what happens next if no further context was provided.
