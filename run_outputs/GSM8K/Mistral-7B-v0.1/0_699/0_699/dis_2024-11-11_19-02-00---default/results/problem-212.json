To find out how long it takes him to cover these distances we divide the length of what he walked over all (which was equal to one round) by the rate at which he can travel along them :  15\u00f73= 5 .

To calculate time spent you divide distance traveled by speed thus Gary spends approximately ((9.3)/(3))\u22483.1 hours. Given this information, it seems like we made mistake somewhere \u2013 particularly when transforming units because such unit discrepancy doesn\u2019t make physical sense\u2014but if assuming our context strictly required solving under assumption those figures represent equivalent distances instead of different scales; calculation remains consistent leading us back to approx=((9.3 km)/(3km/h)=approx=3.1 hrs). Remember always check consistency within your problem statements! We could potentially clarify clarifying statement regarding \u201clight year\u201d mention since commonly known dimensions aren't generally presented using astronomical scale terms unless specifically discussing vast cosmic distances typically beyond practical personal travel scenarios involving objects smaller than galaxies not likely meant here implying probable typo but otherwise understanding aim was purely mathematical based scenario without direct need relating extraterrestrial measurements hence simplification kept intact ignoring stated anomaly resulting overall outcome stands validated provided only original parameters hold true unaltered sans external influences altering intrinsic data structure itself .

Gary walks this distance at a speed of 3 mph so divide the overall distance traveled by our rate (time). Doing division we get time spent equaling distance divided by velocity ((distance)/velocity=(speed)) or Time spent Walking= Distance walked / Speed Walked. Substituting values yields We compute Total_Time_Walking:=Distance~walked/~Speed~/Walked; substituting actual numbers into formulae using variables defined above, results inTotal_Time_Walking:= Perimeter ~/ VelocityPerimeter/(Velocity)= <<perimeter/(Velocity)=26/3=8.6666666666667>> approximately ,or about . Thus round off value\u2248 8 hrs., if rounded to whole hours. Hence the result obtained is close but not precisely exact because it rounds up towards nearest integer without taking decimals exactly accurate to thousandth place accuracy.

Gary needs to cover this entire 15 mile path when going around once. Knowing it takes him about half hour to travel one full lap, since he covers approximately three miles every half hour according to our first solution. But here speed was mentioned so let us recalculate using that information. His rate or pace would be Distance divided by Time. Plugging what you know into your formula yields Speed equals Rate over time \u2013 >Speed=(Distance)/time\u2013->Rate=speed*Time-->(distance/(rate))so-->time==[(distnace)] /[RATE]Plugging in numbers gives -->Time=[Distnace]/[rate]--->[15 Miles]/[3 mph]=5 hoursFor question asking \u2018how may hours,\u2019 directly calculate [(Distance Walked ) ] / [His Rate].
