        " application (2). This result indicates the number of applications/washes we could get if just one single pump were applied as opposed to our scenario of applying both capsules once every other time which yields us twice as few overall servings or approximately half again less overall quantity due to doubling up usage rate.\r\rTo calculate value /cost per unit i divide dollar amount by desired units since I am looking FOR PUMP IN EACH SERVING OR USE ONE APPLICATION NOT NINE SO TWICE AS MANY! Therefore.... COSTPERSERVINGOFONEPUMP=Dollaramount/$Desiredservings Per serving therefore... Costofonepump=$24/(x*((120washing)/(pertwopumps)))=$24/(x*(1/2)*120) Calculate 'X': We want YPA because when solving Xy=(k), plugging into formula results equation equals k times y values equal solution set containing variables; so instead multiply denominator expression above leaving numeral constant while distributing across divisor right side portion.. Thus equalling.....($24/(x)(60)=xCost_Per_Pump$$=Totalprice/",
        ") divided by 2 equals 60 (washing possibilities). Calculate the price value per washing possibility; divide the original cost ($24) over these newly calculated values i.e., 60 times [i]per wash[/i]. Doing so yields 24 / 60 which reduces down as $.4 or .4 cent(since we need answers outcomes specifically requested in 'cents'). Therefore, round off your decimal result up till second figure (.4 --> .04), converting into currency units ('.' changes into '-'), resulting our solution being ['-.4']--> [-'.4']. Hence the correct way around putting things would lead us towards considering single digit denominations hence rendering '.4' equivalent to '4c', providing such specific contextual relevance mentioned within question requirements explicitly making '$24 spent for sixty (= 60) washes means ~$0.4/$Wash'-formulation translating precisely herein dictated as requirement specified termwise requiring said results representation accordingly rendered thus finally outputting simply put:'Final ",

Hence find what portion of full usage rate corresponds exactly across them beforehand calculating expense rates based upon reduced quantities\u2026 It takes about fifty percent reduction going down through three fifth segments when dealing timewise among twenty separate stages thus bringing us closer towards appropriate pricing adjustment measures once again .

To find out what these means I need first figure out single pump\u2019s value \u2013 so my division statement needs denominator changed because if both amounts cover same space i cannot compare them like such but rather take their common ratio or reciprocal relationship meaning every other amount covers equal area/volume compared to original case .
