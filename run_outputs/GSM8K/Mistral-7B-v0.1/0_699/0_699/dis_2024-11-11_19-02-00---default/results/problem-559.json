Subtract your target consumption level(goal)-current rate. Performing necessary operations provides us our solution. Therefore, considering that currently , as stated earlier Jhon was sipping twenty cups while suggested quantity isn\u2019t exceeding sixteen so required drop therefore would mean reducing twelve units hence eleven drops required if u r confused again recheck calculations.
