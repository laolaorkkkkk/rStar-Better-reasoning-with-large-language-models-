To find out how many stickers he ended up having, subtract all the ones he gave away or used to make cards starting off with your previous result; these numbers include what charliesgave to Sarah(which was 9), and also counted when making gifts/cards using one third (or roughly speaking here counting it twice since we divide). This results into approximately 54 \u2013 9*2 \u2013 28 equals about... let\u2019s see... first calculate inside brackets -> [approximately] minus thirty three because twenty eight plus ninety six dividing sixty seven hundredth times ten forty pints\u2026 hmmm!

To verify if we can improve our solution let\u2019s analyze every action separately.
