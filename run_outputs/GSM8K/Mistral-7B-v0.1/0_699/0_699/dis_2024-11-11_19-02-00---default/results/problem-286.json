        " Therefore, before purchasing anything (in this case), you would calculate like so: (5*25)c+ ((2)*10)=(125)+((20))=($145). This means your current balance right now if nothing else happens ($145 or equivalently as 'cent', here it reads out as: Cent_balance=$(145)). Since the cost of one item which needs paying is stated $(0.55)/(55 cent),(you need not consider value conversion.) Whenever dealing with currency values remember these tricks below;   Convert all currencies into decimals while calculating something! Example : One dollar equivlalent to tenyine/hundredth units per one whole unit ie..$1=(100 tens)(equalto=$100)$1$(convertion rule);    Dollars / Currencies => Tens.(dollar)->Tenu!(Dollar->tenu)!So when handling calculations involving change make sure any initial starting quantities also convert accordingly using same rules mentioned above otherwise errors due lack awareness about what actual numbers are being computed appear frequently during solving :) Your solution was correct !
