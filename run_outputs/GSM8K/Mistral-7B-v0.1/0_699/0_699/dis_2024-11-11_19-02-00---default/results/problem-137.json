Identify the price tag attached to the cookie purchase.

Next, since one pack of fries was priced as 'F', the value assigned would still represent any price but this time it represents the sum amount being spent ($15). As stated earlier, F could also stand or mean anything within reason so make sure you choose accordingly when formulating your equation next because herein lies our hint! Therefore let us set \u2018$x=french fries,\u2019 according thusly; therefore X\u2009\u00d7\u2009($7\u200a+\u202f$1)=\u00a0$(8\u200a+$x), yielding $\\boxed{\\$21}.$.
