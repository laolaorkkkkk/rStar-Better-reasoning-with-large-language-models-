Therefore since 28 <= 41 leaving only enough range left to travel another whole foot let alone one partway down a piece you can conclude walt could not possibly make less than  28 .

This means : **Total miles \u2212 Distance traveled during first three days** \u00a0equals to  _*So , if you re arrange these numbers correctly_,you get something like this::   ```   4\u2212d=(41\u2212(4\u00d76))``.      Substituting known values yields```      \t4\u00a0\u2212\tDistances walked on weekend\u00a0\u00a0=    41\u2212(4\u22c56)```                         Simplifying right hand side        `=>`              `$\u00a0\u2212distances walked on weekends ==    41\u00a0\u2212\u00a024==$     Adding distances (`addition operation`)           `$ distancess walked last days ==\u00a0${eq}\u2009\\boxed{17}{/eq}`          As per question statement..the boxes represents 'walk amount or value'.
