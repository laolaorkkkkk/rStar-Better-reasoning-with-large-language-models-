Therefore, 'In all,' or if translated simply into English terms considering common knowledge about units used globally rather than language specific ones such as German, Japanese etc., which also uses both centimeters (' centimeter') & meters(' meter'), but not feet; this leaves us without options involving feet making option B incorrect despite being similar in structure. Instead, our best choice fitting within standard numerical operations applied universally across cultures understanding different systems while retaining same unit representation remains Option C i.e.: \u2018Alice scored exactly half points lesser.' However since none seems relevant due reason mentioned earlier regarding measurement system discrepancy ,it leads me toward choosing D instead because it aligns most closely grammatically even though conceptually unrelated : Alice received just under twice Bob's score.\u2019",
