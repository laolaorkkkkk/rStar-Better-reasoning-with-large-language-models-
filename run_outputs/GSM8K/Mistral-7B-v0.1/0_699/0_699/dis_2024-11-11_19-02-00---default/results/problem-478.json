        " Multiply these numbers together like shown below (one way). 200/group * 7 guide/each group= **1400**. Or you can find it through another route multiplying just one side which still results equally as above. Total ",
        " we need to count all these individuals as follows: (3 groups) \u00d7 (200 employees/group + 7 guides) = 3 \u00d7 (200+7)= 3 \u00d7 207= 621 Total persons attending the excursion . ",
        " employees too; since we know every employee belongs exactly one group, so it\u2019ll also include those amounts as part of totals (i.e., not extra), therefore simply add up both numbers together:  200*3(employees) + 21(tour guide)=  600+21=621 person went on the tour.",
        " three such (groups). One employee per one guide means every pair consists of either an employee or a tour guide not including itself as both entities but keeping them separate since it says 'a person'. With this information we can multiply number of pairs which consist only out of employed staff multiplied by their amount equals  3*200=600 personnel involved directly in activities during excavation; therefore summing up all individuals totals becomes simply adding these together so thus getting our result i.e.: Employee persons+Guide(other than themselves)=Total no ppl present when doing archaeological dig=>summation equation being Tp+(G-Tg)equals what value iff s*(T^)+b/(n/y)+o-(x)/(k^)-c+(z)*w=(U)?",
