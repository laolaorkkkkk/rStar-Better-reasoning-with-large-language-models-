Next decide if it needs multiple purchase because one package may not cover enough quantity; here mark can get sufficient as both ingredients come packaged which means packages only consist up until certain quantities limit so nothing else could happen since neither ingredient would need separate shopping list itemized or ordered but instead just checked off once obtained through standard purchasing routine method when buying such products together. Finally find difference between those numbers too like finding excesses beyond what already available initially plus any other additional ones might also include future use besides immediate plan mentioned earlier considering potential increase demand over time based upon personal preference while maintaining overall budget constraints related costs etc..
