First simplify within parenthesis:`Dry Ingredient Qty= ((5+3+(0.2*2)) / [((5+3+(0.2*2)))/16])`, further simplification yields : `Dry Ingredient Qty = ([(5+3+(0.2*2))]*16)/[(5+3+(0.2*2))]`, so if 'n' represents [(5+3+(0.2*2))], We obtain --> `Total_Ingredients Required = n*16`.

Therefore the answer is: approximately around 144 table spoons or close enough roundabout estimation since real world practical measuring often doesn't yield perfect amounts due to precision factors when preparing recipes.(Note here we used algebraic representation considering original statement didn\u2019t mention exact multiplication factor like \"(0.2)(2)\", rather suggested \u201cdouble\u201d.)

Likewise, since one muffin takes three teaspoons of sugar; this means we can expect these requirements if baking sixteen batches as well \u2013 or simply multiply them directly (since multiplication scales linearly) : 16*3=48+[16*(0.25)]=4+(4)=8 tablespoons of combined items required when making twelve dozen cupcakes using both cups plus half a spoonful per piece rather than just plain halves because it doubles our quantity but stays proportionate ratio wise compared . Thus , only those combinations involving numbers whose product equals forty eight work here according tothe same formula applied previously i.e.,n/2 [a +b] meaning n groups divide into even pairs multiplied together yielding four hundred eighty while retainig whole integer values within parameters laid out above eg(two)[six](twelve)(thirty)+ [(one third),four ]fiftyfive times.(three twenty one).

However if my previous statement wasn't clear enough let me break down again! Here's another way : Firstly calculate individual cookie amounts(Flour=Five units , Sugars)= Three Units & Salt= quarter Unit per Cookie. Second part multiply those numbers into what quantity desired i.e Sixteen since we want sixteen cookies .
