And also Locsin caught 2 more Clownfish(which makes him having )3+(2)=5 . This implies locsen caught a sum of : 5 Starfish plus 9 Sea Horse equals sixteen which when combined brings us totalling up to twenty one ((whereas seven made sense but logic doesn\u2019t permit negatives)) Therefore their cumulative harvest becomes fifty four [i.e., thirty eight].

We begin this process knowing Seahorses collected by Anakin equaled out six , while our second person counted three short thus leading us into calculating six minus three or ; f(star_hors)= 3 This brings up another animal encountered within said region : Clownfish .

        " This totals up to 10+6+3=19 fishes which Anakin was able to get. Locus also gained lesser animals so let us find first what kind of creatures it only managed to capture; this means if you subtract 5 (fewer starfish) out of 10 equals 5 remaining starfish captured or 6 original minus 3 would lead to just four sea horse(s). And while Anakin could gather no less than three butterfly squids, Loci actually gathered 5 additional individuals i.e., one extra plus those initially possessed leading again back into its base count of not reaching below thirty as well--henceforth stated beforehand since both combined together can achieve fifty percent reduction whenever needed! But because neither surpass these set numbers nor undercut them completely makes sense here too\u2013this brings overall summit point down slightly towards midrange values when compared across groups rather raising expectations skyward unjustly yet still maintaining relative worth among different types like mammals vs others present regardless species differences observed within various geographic regions worldwide .
