Therefore ,to find out time needed for taking nap subtract required time for doing homeworks i.e .required_nap=(time_available)-(homework)=180-(80/minutes)=180-80=100 min so Time taken for sleeping would equal remaining time since no activity other than studying occurs during those times : Required nap time = Remaining Time.
