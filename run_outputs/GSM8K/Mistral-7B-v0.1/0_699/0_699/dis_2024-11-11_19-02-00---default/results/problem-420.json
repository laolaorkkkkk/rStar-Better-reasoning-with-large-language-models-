That means you need to determine those amounts before adding them together using multiplication or addition operations. Therefore, calculate the sum raised by both entities combined (= $4000 multiplied by 3). This equals $12000 when simplified through arithmetic calculations. To find out how much current capital exists, add this figure received via contributions (+$12000) to your original/initially stated investment (-$5000): so if we execute '+', '-' & '.', their values become ',','+'.
