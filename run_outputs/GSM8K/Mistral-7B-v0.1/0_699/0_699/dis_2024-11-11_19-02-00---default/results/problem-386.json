        " these scores: 65+94+81+86+74=400. Since we need an average of 5 numbers (tests), divide this sum by 5: 400/5 equals 80. Therefore, Wilson\u2019s current Math Grade is 80 which meets both criteria needed. The answer is: 80.",
        " Divide this sum by the count (which is 5) because it represents averaging them together; so we divide 400 / 5 which equals  80. Since Oliver scored 80 exactly as required by Willowson\u2019s teacher standards, therefore you can say that Williams didn't fail mathematics course but also not passed yet based purely off these numbers alone. However considering typical grading scales students scoring even half way toward their target score generally pass despite seemingly being borderline failing before extra assignments or grades may push upward slightly above passing criteria hence assuming just under ideal circumstance would place him somewhat over edge thus leading us ultimately conclude 'Fail'.
