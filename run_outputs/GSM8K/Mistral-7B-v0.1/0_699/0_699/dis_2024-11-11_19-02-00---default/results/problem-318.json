Next calculate the amount of nongendered kids using their relationship proportion wrt boys which stands at one ten per boy or 10*(number_of_boys)=(10)*30 equals thirty non gendered students . Lastly sum up all these quantities together i.e., Total Children=(Number_Of Boys)+(Numer_of Girls)+ (NonGenders) hence ,Total Children=30+(90+30). Therefore,therefore,total Number Of Kids Is :30(Boys)+90(girls)+30(non genders)=CAL(30, \"+\", 90, \"+\", 30). This calculation therefore translates numerically to; CAL(30, \"+\", 90, \"+\", 30)which resolves down to 150 when calculated via programming language like python etc..

Determine the number of non-gendered children using ratios again; since this category contains one fifth or $\\frac{1}{10}$ the amount present among the boys, you simply divide the quantity of boys into ten parts. Given that there are 30 boys, if divided into ten equal sections yields us 3 kids per part so fifteen students fit within non gender identification group here calculated through division operation i.e.,$\\frac {30} {10}=3$. Add up all three groups together therefore summing quantities obtained previously plus new calculation yielding combined population count henceforth being  3(boys)+ 90(girls)+ 3(non gender identity)= 96 individuals altogether .

        " kids in the classroom (non gender specific). It also says we know this value equals three girls per boy so substitute into equation above. This results in 3(X / 10) = Girls   And since you told us the ratio was girl over boy is actually 3 : 1 rather than being specified like that I see what happened here, let\u2019s just rephrase everything without using ratios because they only add confusion when doing simple math problems Like if you said all classes having three male teachers out of ten would lead me astray..

Since these facts apply equally across both sides equation set up thus making our relationship symmetric meaning G+N+B=T where T stands alone without needing calculation(a general way). This means N=(TB)/4; B*(G+N)=B*((1-(NB%)+anyothergenderspercentage)) or F=W+(E)(M%) but because nothing specific says about those percentages except overall totals let\u2019s call them 'C%' instead resulting f=w+c*. As W here indicates numbers counted among males within groups grouped under either female classification including perhaps transgenders who may choose not identifying themselves amongst male counterparts while E tells us everything counting everywhere along said axes excluding females altogether.(However note though every count relates back via mathematical principles established over thousands years through use during creation processes such modern examples like building bridges),dividers etc.).
