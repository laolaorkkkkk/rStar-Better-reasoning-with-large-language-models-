        " the doorbell (which means was open) 1/4 times more than Jerome\u2019s first friend. Given this information we can solve it as follows; Number_first_friend+Number_second_friend=numberOfDoorbellRingsToOpen First find out what percent increase would result into 1/4 so lets divide .25/.25=.1 To determine increased amount press rate multiply pressureRateByAmountIncrease (.25*.)1=.25 More people tried pressing the button during their stay meaning 20(from FriendsOne)+.25==20.25 Thus PressCountSecondFriend=TotalPressesFromFirstFriend*(Percentage^amountofincreasement)=20(.1)^1=.2So if you add those up You get This-> TotalpressuresignifanceFourthFriendsbuttonPressed+(totalpresstotalforfirsffriendrepressed)(thisrepresentstheadditionalpeoplewhousedtheremainderofthevisit)-friendeightsecondpersonalsignificancetothirdfriend=(signficantnctfourthfreindsButton+)((no...

We need these figures because we know (in addition) that when considering all four visitors only one thing follows chronologically \u2013 namely pressing on the bell repeatedly themselves rather than together.
