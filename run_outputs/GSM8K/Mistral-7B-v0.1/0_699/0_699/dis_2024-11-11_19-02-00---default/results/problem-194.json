Therefore , overall transaction led by variable represented as amount paid versus actual ammount due gets satisfied while leaving none behind like mentioned above . Also keeping context relevant here goes ahead another way too i..e rewriting entire problem under certain premise makes calculation simpler yet valid still holds its ground ultimately delivering resultant correct figures sans any discordance causing hindrances related towards solution feasibility concerns such mathematical puzzle poses itself within realms involving commerce orientated endeavors amongst laymen folks alike .. thus proving useful beyond mere numbers sake !! ;)",

Therefore, 'Change='$20-$10'. Calculating it we get '$20-$10=$10'. Hence ,the amount of money which shall return back/refunded due to incomplete requesting was actually missing information related query(like quantity needed per color), hence I can provide no concrete numerical calculation based purely off presented problem statement..

        " $10. Next subtract what was paid out ($10) form initial budget (amount initially allotted before shopping). Hence $20 \u2013$10= $10 . Finally calculate amounts as such : Money remaining / Amount purchased per unit , hence resultant value =  10/ 2 which equals $\\frac{total\\ units}{unit \\ price} $. Thus resulting into ten dollar worth or ten single colored crayons can be acquired using those extra funds i.e., Change received = $10; thus satisfying original query statement indicating monetary return upon successful execution of stated scenario.

        " answer is: 10. Let me know if you need any further assistance! To create four versions of varying difficulty based on calculating profit percentage (as requested), we can approach it similarly through progressive complexity across levels using examples like baking sales or online product pricing scenarios which involve calculation before and after applying discount rates or markup percentages. These changes maintain context while increasing technical requirements such as multiple products involved, additional considerations like taxes/discounts applied post initial markups, etc., thus providing differentiated challenges according to your criteria.",
