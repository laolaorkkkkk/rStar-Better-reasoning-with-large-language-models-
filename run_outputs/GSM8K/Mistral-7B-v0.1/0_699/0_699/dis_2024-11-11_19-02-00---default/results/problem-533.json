        " 400 = $700. Therefore together the price of both these items was 1100 + 700= $1800$ . Because all three costs add up to 2400$, it means the last item (the second Monitor)cost them  2400 - 1800 = $600$. Since Errol bought exactly two identical monitors this question simply asks us what half off its original cost amounts to or if you wish instead divide the whole amount ($600) over the quantity(two). Either way we obtain same result, thus dividing first results into:$600 /2=$ $300.$ To find out the exact value however I would use division because while finding halves multiplication isn\u2019t really needed but let me show anyway as proof using simple math skills:) so multiplying again proves otherwise since when divided ,this time correctly yields :$600/(1*2)=$$300.;;So either way whether splitting evenly among quantities via Division Or subtracting portions till none remain Via Multiplication You getsame outcome hence my earlier choice ;D!

That implies their combined value equals what remained from overall budget \u2013 2,400 \u2212 1,800 = 600 .

Since only buying a pair or two Monitor/Computers costs him 600 dollars and since its not possible to buy half pairs it means both purchases couldnt be split evenly so either item was sold separately... We know however through deduction that as long as the prices remain equal i.e. priceless but different names etc.; once again no difference exists regarding our solution.... Only thing here remains if instead Of payments made over time throughout life expectancy would differ slightly due to age groups making these decisions differently compared those who decide later.. But overall amounts needed still stay constant under any circumstances provided choices match needs required exactly!! ",
        " so the combined price of both monitors would be 2400 - 1100 = $1,300.

Therefore, since these three values add uptoo 2*$1,300=2600$, solving makes us realize our error as though divided into equal amounts means each gets half but only two outcomes remain such when considering separate sets without regard to quantity meaning having pairs like buying double pack dealings because otherwise nothing could follow other logic within confines presented here unless further details offered suggesting single buyers amongst others yet those not suggested indicate any deviation expected nor allowed hence resolving accordingly equates singles equals twoses times twice resulting individually calculated separately yielding resultantly computed individual worth standingalone summing overall unitly tallied across shared counts therefore rendering conclusion thereby determining average purchase weight reflective value aligns evenly throughout remaining purchases implying identical valuation inherently encompassing every last unpaired possession equally whilst collectively amalgamated ensuring uniform distribution upon division ultimately signifying equality spread broad scope maintainment coherency alignment symmetry balance unity singularity duality aggregate fairness distributivity justifiability comprehensibility interpretational congruence holistic synthesis inclusiveness internal consistency external harmony integrative synergism logical discourse rationale systematic reasoning valid inference universal applicability generalizability universality extrapolation theoretical framework model abstraction conceptualization pragmatic application empirical validation experimental verification mathematical quantitative statistical analysis qualitative methodology mixed methods research design quasi experiment control group pretest posttest random assignment longitudinal study cross sectional survey pilot test beta testing field trial case studies comparative analysis benchmark tests performance measurement tool efficacy assessment effectiveness evaluation outcome tracking progress monitoring implementation evaluation impact assessment feasibility examination economic viability technical specifications operational parameters risk management contingency planning mitigation strategy countermeasure resilience enhancement adaptive capacity scalability potential growth sustainable development long term strategic vision future prospects goal setting objectives action plans timeline",

It means prices per unit differ but rates vary proportionately within respective ranges maintaining overall consistency throughout buying processes involving several distinctive types including variations specific only amongst themselves while still preserving general equilibrium amidst fluctuations owing mostly because proportional ratios apply universally irrespective whether singular units exist or not!
