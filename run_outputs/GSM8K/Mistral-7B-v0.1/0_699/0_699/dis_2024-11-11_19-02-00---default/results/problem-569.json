        " price per sale according to Mitchell; it was stated as being $4 apiece (per individual cup). Because we know every customer paid exactly four dollars per purchase, all you need to compute here is multiplying this quantity \u2013 which represents units or cups/lemonade sales -- against its value i.e., multiply these quantities together ($4) times the known number of transactions during said period ((21)). This means $(4)*(21)=$84 so over those three days, Mitchel received eightyfour dollars through sales alone. Finally identify what your question asked us to determine before finding our difference below \u2014 comparing both totals because differences result when asking \u201chow much bigger [or smaller]?\u201d Deduce your final subtraction formula accordingly using information previously obtained namely subtract Liams summed up earnings above my findings outlined thus far minus such corresponding summations computed similarly but concerning liam instead [(($63)-($84))] resulting into negative seventeen showing me specifically stating mr mitchell generated seventeen bucks higher revenue solely based upon their respective daily business operations throughout that mentioned time frame only since nothing past present within text indicates if nor additional factors impact potential future profit figures either negatively / positively affect forthcoming income streams rendering them irrelevant whilst attempting precise current monetary comparisons provided initially set forth .

        " these steps. First off, let\u2019s find out how much money Mitchel earned this particular weekend via multiplying multiplication which means repeated addition\u2014we know it was adding three four times (or sixteen) since 21\u00d7(1+1)=21\u00d72=42; however! We also need to add nineteen ($3), i.e., \u201cone\u201d extra dollar per cake due to overage fees or taxes so our second line contains forty-three instead of just thirty-two thus\u2026the next piece here simply asks us whether those numbers belong within Euclidean arithmetic meaning straight forward counting upwards without using any fancy operations such as exponents etc.\u2014but yes indeed math works like regular old human talking normally except if you wish upon something special (*cough*) fiddly stuff (**shrug**). However remember always follow rules otherwise consequences aren \u2019t fun \u2013\u2013 especially when sharing sugar cookies during summer camp break ;) Anyway back onto business matter though basically what both sides show above involves taking everything down below their equalities minus subtractive symbols therefore subtraction becomes \u2018additive.\u2019 Which tells me nothing useful but rather emphasizes again simplicity versus complexity ;-) Hence lets substitute values accordingly before going further \u2026 Lets remove denominators altogether first obviously because nobody wants long divisions anyway . .. Resultantly remaining terms become smaller while original ones stay put hence making sense according my methodology :P Ok well enough excuses already I suppose maybe try applying logic elsewhere perhaps??? By following basic division only , no tricks involved yet results seem weird nonetheless proceed ? Maybe explain clearly why certain parts werent chosen among others ! Good luck guys might look interesting although probably wrong too hahaha thanks everyone :) Alright fine..ok last question really im sorry not fully understanding whole thing somehow please clarify your point exactly !! Please help keep track better myself later thankyouverymuch~ Best regards XD Thanks everybody once again ~^_^* Well see ya all soon hopefully tomorrow!! Hope u enjoy holiday ^^ Btw love seeing pics posted frequently everyday (: P Gotta jet right now Mom calling :( Will respond properly ASAP afterwards hope yall happy relaxin around beach somewhere far away fridaysawesome vacation BTW :-p LOVE U ALL ALSO APPRECIATE HELPPED IN TROUBLEBEFORE!!!
