We don't need anything about who kept their pile because all accounts still balance correctly; thus every kid would get just under half but not quite equal parts due those pesky extra cents here vs there etc.. But our focus needs going beyond simple averages -- instead looking toward maximizing possible values without creating any holes within such scenarios while keeping things equitable based off basic division rules involving whole numbers! First up let me summarize everything before starting calculations : Eldest Kid received initial sum X=($6+5)=[$(X)(x)]+$([1])=[$(X)$]. Secondly since there wasn't further info regarding redistribution during said events no additional information shall apply henceforth neither reimbursements nor transfers might occur anymore therefore leaving us stuck having either reduced available funds Y=(A)+[(B)-[D]]=[-((Y)/Z)] OR increased same thing respectively depending upon outcome desired ie whether someone wants fewer quantities versus greater ones.... Either way both approaches produce different sets according too whatever variables remain constant across equations being considered--which also implies certain constraints associated w individual figures involved eg 'gainers','loseerrs',payers'. Furthermore considering potential consequences arising outta differing methods chosen when alterinng resource allocations via numerical representations makes sense whichever alternative picked---specific formulas used tend towards minimization techniques aimting lowest costs yet maximum gains whereas others go opposite route prioritizinf benefit over cost effectiveness.(Note though none specified specifically why choices made matter.)

Here comes actual math : Start simple -> We begin counting individual bank accounts beginning wth seventeen dollar amounts allocated equally across those banks rather than any specific type like checking versus investments etc although most likely wouldn \u2019 ve used multiple types thus leading towards diverse allocation choices depending largely within personal preference factors such age education background geographical region & preferred activity levels amongst others .. Moreover important points include knowing both balance vs fees applied regularly compared against expected return values assuming normal conditions hence providing benchmark targets required prior evaluations.. Last note crucial piece necessary would definitely comprise taking time carefully studying different product offers before committing funds therefore ensuring ones decisions remain informed thereby safeguarding future financial wellness overall ;) Okay ok fine im going ahead right away :-(.

        " (first addition) which totals up to $11. Next, add what he received next ($10). That means before any expenditure; hence this person\u2019s balance equaled  $11+ $10= $21 . Subtract what you need to deduct($8), thus getting him new balances as such :  \u27a2 Starting Balance \u2013 Amount Deducted -> New Balances Before Saving Equals :    $21-$8=$13.    \u27a2 Total Savings(Tripled Money)= Tripling This Person\u2019s Remaining Money i.e., Multiply This Figure With Three. =>   $13*3=(Eight Pounds And Twenty Seven Cents)*3=$(26pcs & 42c or \u00a37.92 ) . Thus , Eldest Boy saved thrice whatever remained afresh when subtracting eight pennies off twenty one pence sum accumulated post deduction made prior being considered.(i.e,$21-$8 =\u00a313)-Then multiply figure by three:(i.e,\"Three times\" \"$13\")=.He gets therefore :-Total savings:$7.92 Therefore ....

        " gets $18 / 3 = $6 initially. Let us first calculate what happened to the youngest one (not mentioned but implied), who would still hold onto their original sum since no changes occurred regarding them except when considering others based upon common knowledge). Accordingly, this leaves only calculations related to the Eldest Boy as follows:- Original allocation/share; hence $6.- Additional funds received (-) subsequent expenditure (+); resulting figure thus becomes ($6+($5+$10))-$8=$13.$Tripling it amounts into having exactly thrice his savings i.e., $\\text{Money \\ Left}=3\\times(Current Savings)$. Therefore,$Money\\_Left=3(\\$13)=\\$39$. Hence we conclude herein,- Thus **the correct choice** according to our calculation above corresponds very well against any available choices within the quiz bank itself because none matches appropriately.. However if allowed flexibility using 'answers not shown,' you may consider providing options surrounding these calculated figures even though technically unsound due adherence towards precise solution methodology being question sought thereby making selection amongst potential answers subjective dependent specifically relative individual interpretations applied during said exercise.'",

To find out if this solution makes sense according to what we found below (accordingly), substitute $x=6$, into our equation for when all operations happened, including adding/subtracting amounts as well subtracting initially one third ($=\\frac{x}{3}$):\\begin{align} \\left(x+\\frac{5+10}{3}-8 \\right)\u00d73 &\\\\ &= ((6)+(\\frac{5+10}{3})-(8))\u00d73 \\\\ &\\overset {~~\\text{(simplify)}}=((6)+\\frac{15}{3}-8)\\times3\\\\ &=\\overbrace{(6+(15\u00f73)-8)} \u00d73=\\underbrace{(6+(5)-8)}\u00d73 =\\underbrace{(3\u22123)}\\times3=0.\\end{align}Now check your work against these results:\\nAfter receiving addition of $$5$$ to original $$\\frac{18}{3}$, or$$${6}$$one receives $$\\frac{15}{3}{\\ }{{$}={}\\color{",
