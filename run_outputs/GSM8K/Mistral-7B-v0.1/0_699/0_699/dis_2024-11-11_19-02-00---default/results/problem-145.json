        " we know this happens once since he only owns one tract of land it would simply result in  10 * 100= 1000 pineapples initially. However, keep also in mind that these pineapples take about three months (or quarter) before being ready or ripe enough to pick , so calculate as follows; As a single patch produces its first yield when cut / harvested takes approximately four quarters(one full cycle ) until it fully regrows . Thus considering a whole growth process lasting roughly half a year (quarter till next batch matures). Therefore having estimated yields over time implies multiplication by fractions corresponding their respective occurrence rates during any specific period such like our case here ; starting off assuming equal intervals but shifting focus into fractional ones relative timeline thus simplifying matters considerably while still achieving satisfactory precision under assumed conditions applicable generally encountered throughout most commercial/agricultural activities involving crop cultivation endeavors..
