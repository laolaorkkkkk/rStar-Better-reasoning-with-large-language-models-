Since all coins (pennies ,nickles &dimes) represent amount expressed below but not actual cash only when you multiply them by their values (.01,.05 .1); They equate themselves back totalling same sum thus having zero overall change/impact....Now using those data...we simply write conversion formula according what currency these amounts belong to(Pen=$.01 Nick=.05&Dime=.$0.1)$Total_US_Currency=(number\\_of\\_each\\_coin\\*value)*currency$So let\u2019s find out our solution here ...Firstly calculating separate sums obtained via multiplying individual coin or paper note denominations mentioned by us against assigned equivalent fractional monetary unit say ($):PenceSum=$(.01\\*(NumberOfEachCoin))NickleSum=$(ValueOfOneCoin)\\*(NoFoNiceTokensPerUnit$)And lastly applying general summation operation among calculated results($)= Total Pency+Total NckkelSum+$total Dime SumIn this case ;Given Data:$ Number Of Coins : Pencies |   No     |   100       || Nickels|     40       || Dimes  |    20        //This translates numerically ..as Follow,$((.01 \\* 100)+.(0.05 \\* 40)+(.10 \\* 20))$ Simplifying further produces $(CalculatedResults~Evaluation)$.Having said so far I feel your interest getting peek through ;)It may seems little complex if understood differently still It always yields correct output whichever way interpreted\u2026i hope explanation helped making easier understanding! :) ",

        " each dime is worth ten cents, and every bill is equivalent to its value because it represents whole numbers (no fractions). To find out what Brady actually saved we need firstly transform all those amounts into a single unit i.e., Dollars using their values according to standard currency rules or equivalencies like:  1 Penny : 1 Cent  |   1 Nickel: 5 Cents       |     1 Dime: 10 Cents           |     Exact amount represented(since no Fractional Coins):        $4          |         $$$              |            $$\\$\\$$                               And finally sum up everything.\r\rTotal Equivalent Amount Saved:$= ((Number of Pennies*Penny Value) / Unit Conversion Factor)+((numberofNickles*nickleValue)/UnitConvFactor )+((Deminutes)*deminevalue/unitConvetor))+(ExactAmountRepresentdByCoins)=($[(100*1)/1]+[40*0.05])/(1), [(.01)]+$[$1*(40),(No fraction here too)]=> ($[[100]]+[2]$)+[$40]=$162 Hence ",
