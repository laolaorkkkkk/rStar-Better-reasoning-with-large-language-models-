Calculate similarly the number of kittens contributed by Trixie using multiplication only since it follows similar logic but this time around uses twelve instead of seven because fifteen was stated early above being twice those owned by Patchy hence making sixteen its value resulting equally equals eight . To find out how may kittens exist currently all you require doing would entail summing up these values : Twelve together plus eighteen makes fourtyfive concluding once upon anytime without fail , therefore having forty five feline offsprings altogether within our midst presently speaking !!!

This means Daisy also would carry eleven additional puppies due to having twelve already before getting pregnant \u2013 meaning both mothers contribute seventeen combined newborn dogs onto the Doubtfire household collectively. To find out exactly what fraction represents these adoption cases among all Doubtfire creatures present during this eventful occurrence, calculate the ratio using totals i.e., seven animals representing only non-puppy/cat occupants plus fifteen newly arrived canines amounting up to twenty species within our scope right here & immediately following Mother Nature\u2019s call!

Thus our current count stands at twenty-six adoptees joined forcefully along side thirty eight freshly emerged infants bringing us together resulting towards sixty four members presently under one roof courtesy Mother Nature!
