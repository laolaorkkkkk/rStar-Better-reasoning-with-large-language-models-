Since only ten extra servings remain unsliced , this proves without any doubt about them since grandmother used exactly what necessary while creating these delicious treats meant for our dear friend soldiers.. But no mention was made regarding unused resources like frosting or ingredients utilized during preparation such as butter / sugar mixes etc., therefore I believe calculating amount consumed based just dessert consumption would suffice here even though its not quite accurate; however still possible assuming equal distribution among others present alongside dinner itself \u2013 hence estimating roughly equivalent quantity consumed over entire event perhaps approximately similar count despite lack clear indications whether individual preferences varied widely across group members who partook!

By evening all but (14) pieces remained which amounts to 40-(x)=<<40-x=36>>(x). This means 36/5 equals about one piece per person meaning around 3 people didn\u2019t eat these last fourteen apples because it wasn\u2019t possible without cutting even further.

        " parts making it a total count of 5*8=40 slices of apples altogether . We know that still unfinished, or leftover ,are just  14 pieces so we can say all(except those)was consumed which would make the rest (that didn't get grabbed): 40-(eaten+leftovers)=40-14-x [where X represents amount not yet touched]    this becomes like a equation setup as :      **40=(numberofguests)(piecesperperson)+14**       As far as I understand only one piece per guest might consume,so let us assume its 1        therefore solving the above expression using substitution method     -->                           40=X+(1)*Number_Of_Guests => Number_of Guests|=[40-X]/pcs/guest         ->Number Of Guests |=(40- 14)/1          --->           N\u00ba_GUESTS^|=26 Therefore, grandma served about twenty six people.(assuming everyone took exactly one slice).The answer is: 26.",
        " * 8 = 40 slices altogether (pieces) initially available . Grandma noticed only ten less than this amount remained afterwards , so therefore the grandmas calculation would go like : original_total \u2013 what\u2019s leftover equals served; 40 \u2013 __= ____. We can just fill those blanks using our understanding already knowing that we need something smaller / lower in quantity since it turns \u201cless\u201d when subtracting\u2026 And because every guest who took food could not eat one full slice alone but possibly shared half which means all these individual servings ended up as fractions ; let us take away doubled fractional portions instead... Thus putting back together again everything used up during serving plus twice extra unserved part adds them self up fully until reaching initial piece count making sense here.. All right! Let X represent \u2018what happened next.\u2019 That is expressed thusly: Starting point minus conclusion comes down simply before sharing starts getting mixed around later anyway \u2014\u2013 Initial Total Piece Number Less Than Equals Serving Done Plus Twice More Yet To Become Pile Remaining End Count Therefore Reconstruct Original Slice Figure Based Off Final Summation Only Right ",
        " Since there remained 14 pieces (which we can count as 'parts'), this means people took away 40 - 14 = 26 parts. Because Grandma divides up all the apples equally among those 8 portions/pieces per whole pie when serving these pies one slice would mean every portion gets exactly half an apple so since I want just find the amount served or consumed which again equals to taking everything but having what slices didn\u2019t get touched , it doesn\u2019t matter if someone asked for another piece you take both apartments because its still only once piece even though being broken down . Hence answering back directly : As mentioned earlier \u2013\u2009there exist various ways about expressing quantity like using words instead numerical values here especially during conversations amongst humans ; saying \u201ctwo\u201d sounds nicer than \u2018sixteen\u2019 right ?
