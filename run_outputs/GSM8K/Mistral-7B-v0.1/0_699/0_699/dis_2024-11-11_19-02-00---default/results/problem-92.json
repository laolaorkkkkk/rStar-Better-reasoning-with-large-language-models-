Using those placeholders one could formulate algebraic models showing proportionality relations between different family members until eventually isolating variable 'X', indicating directly answering your query about \u2018How Old Is Jackson?'

We know according to the fourth condition (James) that James is ten years and seven months young when compared to another child i.e., corey This helps us link both statements since it was stated earlier that James is exactly one lesser kid amongst them meaning our fifth relation would work best if you compare him against amy . Therefore comparing these relations , taking care not mix up those related numbers because otherwise your calculations go haywire ; First calculate difference b/w james(corey+1)+ten-(amy), thus making this relationship crucial : ((Amy)-(-Corey))=(xJackson).

Use process of elimination, reasoning through hypothetical scenarios involving different age combinations until reaching only viable options. Since it would not make sense for anyone other than Justin Bieber's twins Amelle Goudbeek & Alexander Delevanis being over seven but under eight as asked above since those individuals don't fit this description; eliminate answers outside the range you calculated earlier. This narrowing down further eliminates possibilities unrelated due to birth orders among siblings like John Kerrigan Jr.'s three sons Paul Anthony Dudley Sr., William Edward Riley III & Joseph Mark Evans II because although Joe 'Guitar Guy' may match part of your query regarding guitar playing ability relative height requirements \u2013 no mention here about family structure beyond father/son pairs thus making them irrelevant choices too even though fitting physically speaking except perhaps youngest son JM...

        " Jackson; since we want to find Jackson\u2019s age, let us call him X (the unknown). This means Amy equals X+5 because Amy is five years older than Jackon.

That would make Amy =(Corey\u20132) so ,Amy=(11\u20132)=9 Which matches well if Amelia was indeed supposed to be only 2 years behind Corey!
