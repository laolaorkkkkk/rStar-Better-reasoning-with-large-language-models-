To find out Alice's age add another 7 years because Alice is stated as being seven years senior compared to Bethe (thus also eighty summed up.) That makes them both 35+7=42 years old. Therefore, subtracting their respective ages shows us how far apart Bobber was when Cathie began working; i.e.,  \ta \u2013 b or  \tCathie_age\u2013Bobber_age.

        " older than Erica; this means Bob\u2019s age was calculated wrongly (Beth= 35), it would actually mean 'Bob is younger', not elder'. And since Alice is always considered as only being counted one time above Erica \u2013 once when compared against Beth\u2014the correct statement considering all conditions should read \u2018Erica is just over three times younger than Alice.' Thus our earlier calculation doesn't quite fit within these rules set out. To reconcile everything let us go back through steps again but keeping them logical according to constraints provided. We know Erica is 30 years old because directly stated henceforth we look towards finding Betty or Alice whose relation comes next. Adding those crucial extra details mentioned about their relationship here proves beneficial before any miscalculation due date mixup could happen leading into discomforting errors like what happened previously while dealing around numbers unlinkable right side connections regarding comparison without involving duplications such as twice stating same info differently worded under new guise yet holding equal significance across both expressions alike including contextual cues implying chronological hierarchy based merely upon singularity/uniqueness i.e., absence multiple occurrences denoting identical individual attributes shared among interconnected people thereby creating potential confusion especially during discussions surrounding differences amongst peers often misunderstood causing undue disputes unnecessarily aggravated situations stemming largely downplay neglect toward basic logic principles inherent inside reasoning mechanism employed frequently everywhere globally daily regardless geographical placement boundaries demarcation etc thus emphasizing importance understanding underlying reasons why specific terminology choices chosen whilst referencing entities representing varying degrees proximities visually symbolizes intent purposeful linguistic tactics designed explicitly intended solely facilitate precise accurate results obtainments desired amidst scenarios necessitating clarifications pertainings otherwise ambiguous terms used habitually lack consistency uniform standards applicable commonly accepted language arts conventions ensuring comprehensibility universal application irrespective regional vernacular disparities prevalently experienced challenges navigations cross cultural interactions transcending local lingo diversified expression styles distinct communities identifying mutual intelligible discourse modes maintaining communicative efficiency throughout international forum participation diverse dialogic exchanges engagement multitude collaborators participatory interaction dynamics fostering inclusive atmosphere cultivate collegiate respect nurture professional relationships build trust fellowships encourage unity solidarity promote harmony collectivism ideologies reinforce societal coherence encouraging communal cooperation advancement innovation creativity inspiring techn",

Thus when evaluating this statement we conclude that : Age(Alice)-Age(Erica)=[2x(-d)]=[-b]. Substituting appropriate numerical values into these expressions ,and finally solving would allow us reach our conclusion. To put it briefly; substituting original expression equivalents yields :-`-(Electricity Cost per KWh) x (-Fridge Energy Usage) ` which simplifies further to Ecost_fridge=Kwh_usage^a+y`, or rather Electricity cost used daily during fridge operation=(Numberof hours)*((Watts/unitpower consumtion)*Conversion factor), so plugging all known factors leaves `(hours*(kWH))*price`. This results back in electric energy usage being determined directly proportional to time utilized via Power consumption rate expressed herein under assumed constant kWh rates due consideration about power supply constraints not detailed within stated scenario.

To find out the age gap between Alice (who\u2019s actually 30) and Erica being only assumed as calculated above(when we didn't know about it), which turns out later not required but still asked so let me solve like this also! Here, I used direct calculation instead following previously mentioned steps because these facts indirectly stated without having any relation other except mentioning their respective differences hence using subtraction based methodology itself here. Henceforth when talking explicitly; since Bob says no matter what you calculate first keep track or understand something specific might need extra thought process depending upon complexity involved within question formulation/statement interpretation techniques applied throughout examination scenarios encountered typically seen while solving general educational tasks pertaining academic levels especially primary ones commonly termed homework quizzes essays presentations class exercises etc., students often rely heavily off prior knowledge acquired through practice tests similar experience situations occurrences involving various subjects subject areas topics thematic units lesson materials content enhancements student teacher collaborative initiatives group discussions peer support networks mentoring guidelines counselors advisory boards instructional design experts curriculum developers resource persons external training sessions professional development programs specialists workshops seminars conferences roundtable debates panel lectures interactive multimedia technologies simulations case studies research papers journal articles newsletters bulletins blog posts podcasts video clips audio recordings interviews documentaries webinars online tutorials courses certifications diplomas certificates degrees graduation ceremonies transcripts exams answers key manual resources archives databases software applications tools devices libraries warehouses storerooms storage spaces shelves cabinets drawers desks furniture fixtures fittings accessories amenities facilities utilities public transport commute systems traffic management strategies road construction roads bridges tunnel bores railway tracks airports heliports runways hangers hangars gates terminal buildings cargo handling operations maintenance services repair stations refuel stops rest stops service centers automated fuel dispensers self checkouts kiosks cash registers digital receipts mobile apps smartphone operating platforms computer screens monitor displays print media traditional printing press adverts posters leaflets flyers brochures prospectuses announcements information sheets memos pamphlets letters emails news updates notifications alerts broadcast alert messages electronic correspondence postal mail telegram telex telefax facsimile data",

But since it was mentioned initially as well, let\u2019s use both values which means either value can suitably replace another while maintaining relationship intact. Since age gap among them stays constant regardless, we still consider only one reference point i.e., when Betty is compared directly to Erica here its better because direct comparison always helps identify relationships consistently across different points being considered together or individually too. Therefore using same approach also indicates; Bobi ie \u2018Difference Between Age Of Ali And Bita\u201d would remain independent upon switching up any person roles like \u201cErika\u2013Erica\u201d, thus making their common variable essentially unaffected despite alternate references applied during calculations involving other persons related specifically via 'older/younger'. Thus solving problem doesn\u2019t require changing our assumed conditions based solely off secondary information provided about others individuals aside initial condition explicitly stated within question itself whereas ignoring additional data could lead incorrect assumptions thereby affecting accuracy further hindering us towards achieving desired result reliably every time considering various permutations potentially involved whilst dealing complex multi criteria problems such these kinds encountered often .
