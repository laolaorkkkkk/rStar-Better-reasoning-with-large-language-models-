This implies if someone paid same price like ppl used daily midweek timings ($2) but came back home instead using evening / nighttime routes i;e going past gas station lanes etc.. which may not charge any additional charges besides maintenance expenses...then minimum possible extra dollar bills per trip could range widely depending upon traffic situation&road conditions available near destination area chosen hence allowing variations among different folks even while paying similar amounts throughout various localities across US geography(even though overall national statistics donot reveal such differences strongly).

        " let\u2019s calculate how many rides Paul takes per week, including both mornings and afternoons (twice). Twice a day means ten drives per week. And if he took those trips consistently over fourteen days it means seven times this period; so seventeen daily transits across town. To know what amount was expended overall just multiply up all three digits above together multiplying costs correspondingly as well.. Multiplying numbers first we see : Seven Days X Ten Drives/Week = Seventy Four Drivers During That Period Of Time .. Cost Per Morning Drive Is Six Money .CostPerMorningDriveIsSixdollars...

Thus it was actually happening once per half hour over this period \u2014 meaning twenty rides overall ((morning) ($6 / one time=$6;(afternoon)$2/one time= $2;($6+$2)/half hr)=$8+per week), resulting in fourteen drives altogether((Morning)&(Afternoon)(once per Half Hour)\u00d7Twenty Days)). Multiply daily costs together:$8 \u00d7 14days \u2192resulting in 112$. Consequently, $\\text{",
        ". During this time period it was both in the mornings as well as afternoons (twice). This means we multiply everything up so let\u2019s start calculating costs per one day first\u2014for every single round trip or commute within those 14 consecutive calendar days: Morning trips would add around ($6/trip)x(one way journey)*2(each side), whereas evening ones accounting only half that amount($2*2=4); if you group them together over whole working week which takes seven full rotations (back home again): Total expenses equal [$6+6+$2+2]=$16. Since all figures apply simultaneously across exactly fourteen similar workdays following their established patterns; when summed cumulatively through doubled interval timelines yields higher aggregate sums accordingly [(Weekly figure)*numberOfWeeks]: Thus our result becomes $16*(Number Of Full Working Days Eligible For Commuting)=$16*$2[Total Cost Per Day]*DaysInCompleteCalendarWk/(DurationOfEachPeriod)$[Single Period]; Upon further consideration & application:$[(TwiceDaily Rides)(CostPerMorningTrip)+OnceDailyRide](Summarized Daily Expense)=[$((Because Multiplication Distributive Property Demands That Both Bases Are Used Here $(FirstTerm)^2$(SecondAmount))$^TwoNights][Multiplied By Seven Days]]=[FourteenthDayOverlap].

        " mornings AND 14 afternoons \u2013 so that makes it a total of (morning rides \u00d7 price per ride) plus (afternoon rides \u00d7 price per trip).

        " spent on his afternoon rides. Again, Paul was also driving 14 times in the afternoons (once every other day). And since it costs only $2 per trip in the evening compared to $6 in the morning ($2+$4= $6), this means he spends less than half as often but still paid quite alot when combining both trips throughout one whole weekend! This leaves us calculating all expenses which results into adding together what\u2019s already mentioned above plus another amount equaling double those initial values \u2013$16x$, because if someone goes out once daily... let\u2018s say their travel time would take up four hours instead; otherwise called commute home(or whatever reason) before getting back onto public transit etc..
