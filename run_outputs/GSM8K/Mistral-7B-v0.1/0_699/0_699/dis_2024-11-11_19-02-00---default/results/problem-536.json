Calculate the age difference between Chenny and Alyana based on this information as follows; As per instruction it\u2019s mentioned 'Alyana being four lesser years than Chennie', so subtracting we get : Age Difference (AD) -> AD=Cnny \u2013 Aldana-> AD=10\u2013(Alyna), Since Alyna i.e. aged \u2018X\u2019 below CNY=> X=(CNY)-Ad,, Substitute all values => Ad=(10\u2013AgeOfALdana)=(10-(Anne+(-2))).

Determine Annas\u2019 age. According to this line \u201cAnna being 2 year elder\u2026\u201d implies Anna was born later but closer calculation would mean you add 2 years onto Alice because annas come immediately next so it makes sense to understand as 'older'. Hence ,the sum becomes Annie =6+2 =>  8 . This sums up our reasoning process followed till arriving at conclusion i.e., \u2018answer\u2019 ->  8.
