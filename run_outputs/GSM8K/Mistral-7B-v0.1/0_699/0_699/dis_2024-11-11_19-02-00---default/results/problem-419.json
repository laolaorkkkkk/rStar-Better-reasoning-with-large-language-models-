That means half its initial displacement equals exactly those extra steps needed over their combined remaining vertical separation once reached landlocked bottom stationary object positions.(In case any reader may ask why not use 'half minus 1/2?' Its just easier math :P ). This tells us every foot difference(=x) multiplied into itself represents equal amounts gained later during retrieval process due earth rounding effects near horizon lines etc , although still significant enough so don`t get confused thinking otherwise:(Also no harm considering potential nonlinear acceleration parameters involving drag resistances within atmosphere)(We aren'`nt dealing about gravity being linear around sphere center mass like usual physics models instead let`said force pull vector acting radially upon surface areas increasing tangent curves relative velocity rates while reducing kinetic friction coefficient simultaneously )So basically saying our goal state value calculation requires taking absolute magnitude values apart since changing altitudes vary greatly across scales .

Thus, according to our second equation , Oscar needs to gain approximately (.5)*his current value+(3K)(distance needed ). Using these equations results show us that the maximum possible vertical distace required can only occur under extreme conditions.(for example during winter periods woth lots snow accumulation due o frozen surfaces etc).
