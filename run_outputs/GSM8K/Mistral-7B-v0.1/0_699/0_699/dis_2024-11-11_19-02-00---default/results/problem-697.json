Regardless though without knowing exact population sizes etc used during initial stages calculating time frame required afterwards yields very few possibilities leading toward potential outcomes ultimately becoming unrealistic compared ones available choices . Nevertheless using known statistics regarding average populations existing worldwide currently seems most logical considering current trends suggest human growth continues slow increasing rather quickly hence likely won cause several billions alive presently might sometime eventually join large families forming sizable extended kin groups possibly containing thousands / millions altogether together across generations spanning decades millennia years later\u2026but certainly impossible estimate alone couldn ' not provide precise figure based purely upon generic terms such stated below : ",

Thus far; Calculate how many 'greats' you need first using this formula before counting individual members down through additional layers.(i.e., calculate sibling counts prior calculating cousins or further removed relationships.) This provides count data instead of naming/labeling individuals which can lead us astray if not properly organized--as names may repeat when listed individually!

Each one supposedly carries forth only female descendants. Therefore assuming every individual represents potential parenting capacity equates to finding out triplets produced by each couple descendant generation wise; hence it follows our multiplication rule set earlier stating \u2018each [child] has three babies,\u2019 consequently yielding eighteen new life forms born onto the stage of existence during said gathering session described previously.

Next add them into calculation again considering this time we already know the initial population which shows what comes next as being multiplied times before adding those numbers together means multiplication needs parentheses around its quantity so if you multiply one set first ,and only use addition later . You need brackets [ ] or braces { } around the entire equation not just single groups inside like () OR [] Only when every group involved starts / ends within same pairing signs everything works correctly according math rules!
