So if you multiply the amount per fruit times their respective amounts (i.e., 2x*40= 80 gcobes and x*20 =  2gbill), then add them together you get your result, which would make up all totals. This makes up my calculations... adding these answers up I conclude Jasons whole collection equals (80+ 2*80)= 240g . Since our question asks about only a single bags worth o jelly bean mixings , rather than individual items inside combined batch sizes , therefore dividing such overall collecting mass into separate collections according its own distinct unit measurements becomes crucial here..

Finally, add up these totals together; 1000g (from the chocolate)+ 1600g (from the fruits) which equals=  2600 g .
