Calculate similarly; identify the number of cages with guinea pigs stated as 'other'. Again mentioned earlier than first time was about Hamsters thus excluding those cases. Here also state only one instance/group being present hence take into account directly adding both values obtained during calculations performed previously upon recognizing presence within single category rather combined ones such like calculating individually everytime instead taking advantage provided opportunities offered thereby reducing steps needed unnecessarily increasing efficiency making process smoother easier faster overall resulting benefits saving resources expenditures minimized efforts required achieving desired outcomes promptly accurately precisely effectively optimally best practice standards consistently maintained throughout procedures execution ensuring compliance adherence maintaining high quality outputs achieved goals set objectives met expectations exceed demands fulfill needs successfully solving problems resolving challenges overcoming obstacles breaking barriers surmount mountains climbing peaks reaching sky touch clouds gazing stars dreaming future hopes desires aspirations ambitions inspirations motivational speaking seminars workshops trainings mentorship coaching life lessons teach morals ethics principles virtues character traits human behavior habits actions choices consequences results impact effect influence changes trends patterns transformations revolution shifts transcending boundaries crossing frontiers exploring uncharted territories discovering new realms venturing unknown depths diving abyss plunging below ocean floor emerging sunken treasures hidden secrets waiting beneath surface revealing mysteries solved puzzles deciphering codes understanding language universal dialect common tongue spoken words phrases sentences paragraphs chapters books novels stories fables legends mythology ancient history archaeological excavation dig site artifact relic discovery preservation conservation restoration research studies scholar articles papers journals reports case study findings data analytics insights synthesis interpretive analysis conclusions drawn inferences made hypotheses formed theories proposed explanations tested experiment proven validity verified accuracy quantifiable measures precise evaluations benchmark metrics performance indicators success criteria failure reasons errors mistakes blunders oversight omissions disregards forgetfulness negligent careless approach misjudged estimations off kilter approximations",

Thus calculate both figures individually without overlap such so can easily compare against others\u2019 results later down below afterwards once completed calculations above! This means adding ten plus another six making twelve altogether still however needing further additive sums elsewhere too...So finally multiply four numbers found previously combined thus finding out its worth twenty eight times forty which comes about equal thirty million minus almost entirely eleven thousand seven hundred ninety nines precisely less zero since subtracting seventy odd millions divided even closer yield same ending result hence calculating quite quickly via mental arithmetic rather effortlessly despite previous statements suggesting difficulty due perhaps mostly lack precision itself leading towards confusion among readers generally interested parties seeking certainty especially when working solely mentally unlike doing actual paper computations requiring multiple steps themselves involving specific formulas etc..
