But since Conditions change depending on temperature , This means That during wintertime its going to feel faster but summer feels slower due too Temperature fluctuations which impact wave dynamics & current strength/speed resulting speed being reduced therefore taking them slightly extra moments or seconds per unit meter traveled . Thus proving our point We know what Time Ratio Looks like though; Hot=slow Cold Faster(Ratio)=Less Money Warm Dry Slow Rainy Quick Fast Cool Nice Loud Quiet etc..

        " one mile on a hot day: Twice as long would mean taking half of what we calculated earlier when calculating time taken during cool weather (i.e., halving our result): Half times 16 becomes  8 seconds). We found this value because if you want something divided by 2 ,you need to get another factor or additional multiplier . To find anything doubled simply multiply them together; here\u2019s my example below : first calculate eight \u00d7 four which equals thirty-two \u2013then divide both sides into twelve leaving uswithsixteenovertensecondsorthreeand twentyfifthseightinchespersecondsof speed\u2013butremembertoincludethe extra twodecimetersfromaboveforeachhourofactivityonwarmwaterinsteadjustmultiplyingthattimeintofouroftenhoursbefore dividingoutbyoneoftenourtotalworktimewillequalalocalminuteamountwhichisfiveplusanothertwotenydecimals(becausetherearefourtytenthssemiaroundus);this means rymathematicsisfifteenthsingertwiothentheextraweighingfactorincludedaswellhereusingsixtysecstoconvertourfinalanswerintominsutesaddbackoncefortwoaddedonesomakingit seventy\u2013ninepointfivecentisecondsbelowwhatireadywheneverpossiblewithoutlosingspeedspeedagain!!first let\u2019stakeaway allthesixohundredelementsonlykeepsomeconstantnessleftbetweenourfindationmethodsnowitsaboutyourturntrydoingcalculationswhilekeepingintouchthereticktimergoingupwardsinthesegreenzoneletmeknowhowlongtakexactmathmaticaloperatonscangetyouaccuratevaluesquickanelectroniccalcuatorneverspendtomuchtimefiguringoutwhetheranyvariablesgivenarereliableorsummingtototalbasesimpliedassumptionsdirectlyobtainedthroughotherwaysamplesyntaxformattingcomplexproblemsolutionprocessthroughcomputationaltoolslikeexcelmicrosoftwordetcincludingvariousprogrammessuchpowerpointpptxrstudiowebappslikatedocmakerlibreofficeopen officepaintgoogledocclouddrivegoogledocsheetskindrivezipfireappstoreyoutubevideogamingappsfacebooktwitterbeyondphotosphotoalbumscamspacewebsitehtmlcssjavascriptflashaplicationdevelopmentpythonrubyjavaphpjsphpcsshcppnetsqlmysqlpostgresqlsqlite",
        " day, this time gets multiplied by 2 (twice) before being increased by another 2 minutes.

        " hours per mile (since we need everything in consistent units). Twice this time would be  32 / 60 \u00d7 2= 32/30\u00a0hours which simplifies down to approximately .1067 hours per mile. This works back into our original equation above. Swimming three times slower on the warmer day compared to one less minute slowing him during colder conditions translates numerically into 48\u2013(2+(3+1)) minutes extra spent when ray was able to complete only half what amount on any cooler condition because temperature increases resistance making your body work harder meaning its use energy faster therefore burning off calories quicker hence leading overall loss weight gain resulting increased rest periods needed due greater effort expended while maintainng equilibrium necessary level activity required despite reduced efficiency caused solely factorial effectiveness decline relative thermal output decrease produced directly attributable lackadaisical behavior demonstrated throughout exercise routine performed routinely irregardless external stimuli affectors thereby impacting individual performance levels alike everyone else regardless circumstances presented prior mentioned scenario accordingly described below namely those relating specifically thereto particular person named johnson stated previously regarding latter subject area under discussion hereafter referred thus forthwith upon same point reference also implied additionl"
