Thus far; everything seems correct thus far however when you try putting back into equation form something changes slightly because all these units don\u2019t match exactly anymore except maybe numbers themselves though still seeming odd looking here too such\u2026as shown below.. But overall what remains constant throughout while calculating etc stays just fine till last part only thing missing possibly might include conversion factors involved perhaps making sure unit rates make sense also consider possible round errors if using decimals versus fractional expressions otherwise nothing else appears needed besides simple multiplication & division operations involving percentages either way whether dealing purely w terms vs calculations directly afterwards would certainly help matters greatly especially considering any discrepancies may arise due mainly based off differnt ways interpreting results thereby causing confusion amongst readers alike regarding accuracy within provided answers compared against original data sets used earlier stated respectively ..
