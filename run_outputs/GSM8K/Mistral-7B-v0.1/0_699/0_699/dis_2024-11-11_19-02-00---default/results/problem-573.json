It mentions here that Kathina withdrawal occurs over time, specifically it says \"$100 from the account...every...\" This reveals she takes away this specific sum per unit of time \u2013 months, not daily or weekly amounts but one standard measure of time represented as 'month.' Thus we identify our unit interval periodicity as Months ('B'). Our starting value remains unchanged because no interest accumulates according to information provided so far ($3000), hence Value=A doesn\u2019t alter throughout the process Time='T', B refers explicitly to the term/duration mentioned in context \u2014In this case \u2018Month.\u2019 Substitute these parameters into formula F(n) = V\u2080 - P \u00d7 N\u2090\u1d66x using values found above results in Function formulation becomes F(n)=$3000-$100\u00d7N\u2098 where n represents quantity specified directly relating back onto original instruction ['Time']. Plugging respective numbers indicates Total expense spent=$100*X, X symbolizes units measured based off stated scenario therefore equals calculation involving multiplication operation leading towards conclusion regarding Future Account Status resulting overall expression evaluated translates thus becoming Final "
