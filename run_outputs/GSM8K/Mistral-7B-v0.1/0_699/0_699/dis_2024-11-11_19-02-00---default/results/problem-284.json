Therefore, together, this trio came out with 240 different works during their writing sessions over the course of one single weekend (two consecutive nights). Thus, according to our question, when asking about both weeks combined or 'alongall', which refers specifically to Week ",
        " stories. When you add those up it totals (20+40+60) or, equivalently, 2*100=100 tales during their story writing time over one whole week. But when we see what happens next we can already begin computing our solution; if everyone doubles their output rate for another identical amount of time -- which amounts to again twice as numerous stories being produced overall than before \u2013 such duplication simply means multiplying this initial summing result times itself once ... ie., squaring! As such calculation says outrightly, every pairing combination counts only single other way around too \u2026 meaning so far uncountable combinations could possibly exist among siblings alone who individually differ greatly within themselves\u2026 However since three persons involved here don\u2019t care whose specific work appears most prominently throughout entire body count , therefore allowing them free reign upon doing something together without cares concerning individual identity either whether someone took lead role/ responsibility mainly behind actual creative process taking place instead matter not ; rather concern rests primarily towards outcome obtained through collaboration thus making sense logical statement holds true under present circumstances regarding quantity sought wanted achievements achieved subsequently becoming apparent beyond mere numbers expressible merely using plain language terms used earlier example above mentioned clearly explaining reasons why certain numerical figures may seemingly look different depending perspective taken despite constant difference origin remaining intact whatever else situation considered might vary slightly across varying cultural context setting aside obvious similarities encountered wherever people interact socially regardless race religion belief affiliation marital status occupational position educational background age gender physical appearance etcetera factors still affect relative importance placed accordingly relating specifically various relationships formed personal connections shared interests gained collective experiences exchanged lessons learnt wisdom developed henceforth contributing positively significantly impact global society worldwide community inclusivity fostering unity diversity respect tolerance appreciation friendship cooperation partnership solidarity camaraderie hopeful optimism goodwill warm hearts glad smiles brighten evenings stars twinkling peacefully sleep sound dreams healthy bodies nurturing environment flourishing nature beautiful landscapes natural wonders wonderous seas skies oceans earth atmosphere clouds rainbows snowflakes sunshine moonlight shining glitter sparkles everywhere just everything really basically anything anywhere ever no exceptions nothing special nobody anyone particularly important particular event celebration party gathering reunion anniversary birthday new year holiday ceremony festival season fun fair entertainment amusement activities sports games competitions martial arts practice training skill development",

Thus overall throughout those weeks, All their collective efforts yielded him writing up quite literally hundreds upon pages of unreadable garbage (alright maybe not this severe but it seems like tons).

To get the combined total sum of their story writing across both weeks we add those three results together which totals as so;  40 (week one) + 80(Braylen's Week Two Stories)+ 120 (Week Three Stories). This equals 240 when you combine them all up. Thus, this means over fourteen hours including Wednessday night until Sunday morning afternoon before starting school again if it took about half hour per six pages plus reading out loud time included. It was enough because my younger daughter came home happy saying goodnight! That\u2019s what counts right Daddy!

        " 40 stories. It also identifies those as equaling twice (x) what would only fit within their hands; therefore if we split this up into small enough quantities or subdivisions it can become manageable. However since our numbers involve larger values such as these totals above mentioned let us simply work directly using math instead which means halving one group\u2019s value thus doubling another resultant quantity but keeping both sums same when multiplied back together again hence resulting overall count remaining unchanged just because parts changed form like flipping them around doesn't mean actual sum affected either way mathematically speaking no matter whether individual elements switched position due to mathematical operations applied upon collective grouping always yields original combined cumulative worth even though elemental units may reconfigure among themselves maintain identical numerical weight relative towards grand total still reflectively held across entire aggregate composition barring otherwise stated disruptions alterations externalities etc..

This equals twenty multiplied by two which results into forty plus fourty multiplied by two which totals eighty. Since we know that doubling tells us about addition when applied repeatedly so simply adding thirty onto six zeroes comes out equaling twelve thousand four hundred fifty Two additional siblings joined up later who also contributed similar numbers of writings thus making calculations easier We can represent them mathematically let sigma(n)=N+Fourth root fifth power N represents sum whereas Factorial denotes n factorized hence yielding very large outputs but requires use Big O Notation To find answers involving extremely fast growth rates apply Exponential Growth Principle When you add another layer allowing for even faster expansion Euler Number denoted usually with Greek letter phi gets used whenever exponential processes come around Because new person introduces exactly same quantity increase like original three others Total Written Content Totality Of All Stories Combined Here considering only existing figures without accounting extra writer contribution Equal distribution among participants equitably implies sharing amongst identical contributors Each individual\u2019s narrative creation rate remained constant through progression Period under review Therefore every subsequent batch yields precise amount increased parallelly Thus calculation simplified assuming uniform output scale Henceforth Required Scenario Entails Duplication Every Entity Producing Similar Yield Implies Consistent Rate Direction Multiplicativity Procedure Justifies Addition Operation Through Serial Repetition Concluding Point Summations Correspond With Original Quantities Tripling Upon Recurrence As Previous Measurements Are Appended Simultaneously And At Match Rate Results Anticipated Figure Emerges Based Pertainingly Accumulated Work Following Logic Sequence Subsequently Ensures Preservation Observing Initial Conditions Final Figured Outt Result Count Doubles Due Uniform Output Amplification Methodology During Iterative Writing Cycles Assuming Steady Personal Contribution Thriving Population Expansion Mirrors First Three Descendant Offsprings Merging Cohesive Creation Pattern Delineates Extraction Of Group Collectively Responsible Across Accountable Dimensions Performed By Enumerated Constituents Together These Composers Establish Base Framework Allowing Parallel Procession While Encapsulating Same Gener",

Add together these amounts from weeks one through two. Adding up both instances results into tenfold cumulation \u2013 specifically [20+40+(4*2)+(2*(2*4))] or [(2*20)+((2^2)*4)] tales/narratives within your immediate household context.
