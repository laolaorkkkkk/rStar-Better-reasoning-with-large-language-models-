        " us 1000 / 3 = approximately 333. However we can round off here since it involves counting discrete entities (students). Hence around about ~333 students initially passed via entrance. Subtract this from the initial count, so leaving roughly 1000 - 333 = 667. Next divide this number into fifths , getting about .2*667=around 133 Students go Out ExitB next Round Up or Down accordingly As its either going to leave less than half student OR exceeding Half you always choose upwards Approximately means Nearly Rough calculation would put somewhere close enough but exact value cannot ever occur due to human imperfection!

Exit A saw first departure; this means only about half or approximately 166 go outside initially via entrance A(~333 divided into thirds). From here leaves another ~200 leaving towards others except Outlet A i.e., roughly rounding it up further would mean Approximately one thousand minus Two hundred sixty three equals fifty seven going through Entrance B plus thirty sixers using ETC leading back totalling ninety fourteen leavings from All Three Exits together subtract twenty percent off seventy eight times yielding Twenty point Four Rounding Off Again Final Result Nineteen Students Go away Using Maintenance Door Calculated based upon approximate values considering fractional remainders involved due to nature of question scenario not necessarily exact count Possible Error Margins",
        " 30% leave through Exit A but not all people take part so we multiply it again (which makes sense when you look closer) resulting into this equation: Exiting_A=Exit*percentage leaving through Exit A*(exit+people entering)/number of possible entries per student(each can choose any).Exitting_C=(Initial_NumberOfStudents-(Number Of Students_exitedAtAB))/(initial Numberofstudents)-Percentages going through AC Percent_AC)=((Init_NCB-Exiting_AMCB).Now plugging values:(ExitingA==333.33*.3+(333.(3/5)+(.5)).Solving results in ((1000-.3*333)(3/.5)). Which equals 826 or "
