        " product (area) equaling this rectangle times its width [Length X Width], or LxW=360; also known as Area Formula . Using Dimensional Analysis , we can convert inches into meters :      cm^                            m       mm   inch              centimeters         millimeters          inches     \u00d71\u00a0cm        /   2.54\u00a0\u00a0           \u00a0\u00d7   /               1,000             This means if you multiply one dimension(inches), divide it/multiply other dimensions accordingly & add them all together.. Example here would involve only lengths because both values provided measure same unit.(mm ->m).
