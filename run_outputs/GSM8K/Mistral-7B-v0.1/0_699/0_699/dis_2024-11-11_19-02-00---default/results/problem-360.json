To solve this type problems like these you need either first express it as algebra equation or using math concepts such as subtraction operation (as seen here), multiplication, addition etc., but without any mathematical expression involved directly we can assume variables needed would not necessarily translate easily into our language skills hence following option B seems most suitable; though if you want algebraic representation 'x' could represent your unknown variable(son\u2019s Age) since doubling something results exactly double amount compared when multiplying both sides by same quantity helps maintain equality/same value thus yielding useful info about relationship mentioned making C & D invalid choices. Option E introduces division unnecessarily causing confusion because dividing doesn\u2019t help identify exact ages whereas what was required actually needs identifying one specific numerical figure only so ruling out E also!

It was stated that this milestone occurred when he became exactly 5 years younger (or earlier) than doubled (multiplied by two) what would currently characterize his son's respective lifespan. This information allows us to infer that if we take away those extra 5 years mentioned above, it results precisely into half(equal division). Consequently; subtracting these 5 years yields 45 - 5 =  40; thereby indicating as well such reduction indicates roughly equivalent proportions based upon doubling or multiplying by twos. To conclude though , all remaining calculations require solving following equations like below : let 'x' represent current ages so here ; We could formulate our equation using variables within brackets including subtraction operations [like shown next]; henceforth represented formulaically through numerical expressions along algebraic conventions .
