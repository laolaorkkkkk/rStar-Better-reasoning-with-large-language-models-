Fifty plus sixty equals seventy -- just shy of what we expect!

        " this problem without calculating everything before handing out answers! First off; let us calculate all existing cows (both old ones plus newly purchased). Before purchasing additional animals it would look something like following table.(Table not required) | Stall No.:| Number Of Cows:=:-:| :-:||-------|-----||  1     |   20 ||---|--|| ... | --- ||---- | ---- | We see that ten rows sum up totals as such => [2x(1+...+10)]=2(55)=110 so far. Now addition occurs when taking fourteen extra units per row=>[2x(1+...+10)+4*10]=2*(55)-40=(110-40)=70 Thus our result stays within range ((a<=b), since initial value was b<d if any 'd'-factor changes than resulting solution needs adapting.). However looking carefully enough you might notice another method through which computation comes easy though may or maynot need intermediate storage(:)) Let\u2019s divide whole amount among respective divisions:::(Total New Animals / Total Divisions):=>[(NumberOfNewCows)/No_ofRows]=->(40/10)>==><=<<<-(-)(->>=)->[]((()<>))) .

        " cows/stall. Add the recently purchased cows (that are divided) when distributing this additional stock among those same cow enclosures. That means 40 newly acquired bovines need to be evenly distributed throughout these initial locations; thus resulting as 40 / 10 or simply four per site. Totaling up all factors reveals that every location contains precisely 20 + 4 = <<20+4=24>>24 animals within its confines. Considering we want only eight such containments multiplied together \u2013 if one encircle equals 24 heads it would result naturally that their collective value can indeed summon itself back forthward across countless imaginable combinations yet yield no surprises upon repetition... Therefore considering multiplication merely adds numbers under scrutiny while negation removes any previous accumulation thereby producing zero henceforth never repeating nor diverging irrespective whether said arithmetic functions persistently applied beyond single instance evaluation times etc..
