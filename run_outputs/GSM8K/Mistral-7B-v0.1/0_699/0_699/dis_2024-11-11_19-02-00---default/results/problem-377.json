Let us first calculate what would happen if 'would get twice same price as last month', since prices remain constant , getting even less means fewer units purchased so doubling them wouldn't make sense; also buying equal(same quantity i suppose )fruit yields roughly similar amounts earned thus making triples feasible too but being told halving implies lowering demand rather than increasing ; moreover explicitly using past sales figures seems unnecessary unless stated otherwise or asked directly hence leaving out unrelated data doesn't harm our equation nor makes solution harder ..

Since Saturday isn\u2019t mentioned neither Friday nor other details apply meaning everything stops once Wednesday finishes off thus leaving behind a value equation consisting entirely of whole numbers:$(Y/(X))$ being multiplied together equals Y such amounts can safely go into X while keeping result integer valued without any remainder because integers under multiplication form perfect square pairs.

Given data doesn\u2019t mention anything about potential fluctuations across days thus assuming uniformity & proceed accordingly.
