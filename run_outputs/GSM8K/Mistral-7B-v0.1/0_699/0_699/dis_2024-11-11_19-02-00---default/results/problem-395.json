It mentions her Dad brings home 2 boxes which contain 15 card per unit so we multiply these figures together; this means Erica receives as gifts `2*15` or `30`. Sum up all elements involved including newly formed sets minus those distributed ones ((initial+gift)-distributed) This indicates firstly starting numbers plus any additional valentines being handed over `(=20+(30))` All subtracting values removed once exchanged (`=(+50)` because it accounts for both incoming and existing personal collections before distribute actions), leading us to find what was finally still available following distribution phases if applied uniformly across everyone reached like school buddies(=`-(+24+5)=1)`. Since distributing occurred among different groups individually not implied uniformity therefore calculations involve respective action sums respectively separated under individual context lines within same transaction environment envelopes.
