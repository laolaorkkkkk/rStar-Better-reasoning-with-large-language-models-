To find out exactly when these media will fail let us halve our previous difference which yields ((1000-491)/2=254 as per above calculation showing full equivalence but using half means only getting close without any remainder.. Using similar logic lets take away another set equaling 49% less than maximum , leaving approx 91 uses unused thus reaching approximate failure point soonest ..So finally here goes my conclusion: These devices still have capacity until approximately ninety eleven plays worth distributed equally among them before expected wearout occurs.(in practice probably slightly sooner due variation factors)..

At this point we could sum up all potential combined use as follows : n*(n+m)*(x*y), here n=total lifetime usage ratio needed till max capacity i.e., [1+(cumulative plays required)] , m=[lifetime without uses] & hence y being their respective ratios or fractions.\r",
