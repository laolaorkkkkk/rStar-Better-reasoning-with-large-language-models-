Bottom line ? Consuming such capsules regularly over long periods isn\u2019t advisable unless required medically otherwise ,but short term use limited mainly when looking forward towards achieving desired goals might still work fine provided precautions taken seriously whenever taking anything extra ordinary outside everyday norm..
