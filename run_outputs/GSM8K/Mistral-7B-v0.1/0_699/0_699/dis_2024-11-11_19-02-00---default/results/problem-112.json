Since we know each school consists of six hours daily; Teachers could potentially spend up to eight periods within this span because most schools follow an ELA block schedule system instead of traditional block time frames comprising subject teaching intervals or 'periods'. That said only considering regular full hour classes makes it either three or four sessions depending upon whether sixth period exists so let us assume students receive equal breaks as well without wasting any minute here i=four(i assuming fourth/hour) if these meetings happen twice daily calculate them accordingly m*t+p*(m*)y+(n)*d =>where y represents years , n symbolizes months, p denotes weeks while d stands for days . We can deduce through calculations below : Total Cleaning Per Day Of Whiteboards=(Total Lessions Done By All Four Together)+[(Lessons Completed During Extra Periodic Timeframes)-[NumberofTeacherstakenoverThisPeriod]* NumberOfExtraTimesEachDay)(All Classes Held Are Considered FullLengthClassesOnly): Here Every Single Lesson Has TwoInstances WhereWhiteboardsGetCleansedAndHenceWeHaveTwoRepeatEventsPerSessionThatMeansForEverySingleFullLengthClasssessionweWillCountAnExistentialCleaningAsWellIncludingAnyAdditionalSupplementaryOnsetUponCompletionFromOtherSourceBeyondOrdinaryEducationalSchoolPracticesWhichConvergeAtSpecificTimingPointsWithRespectToTimeIntervalAlternativesRangingAroundStandardDailyHorariosystemsThusCalculationIsRequired ToDetermineFrequencyatwhichBlackboardAreCleanseAccordinglyUsingGivenDataItLooksLikeOneVeryImportantFactorShouldBeAccountedForRegardingAmountofWorkDoneByIndividualStudentsButNotJustConsiderationsRelatedDirectProfessionalServicesOrTasksAttributedtothePersonnelPresentWhatTypeDoTheyHandle OrAssumeWhenMixedTypesApproachedUseSeparateEquivalenciesWherePossible AsExampleifstudenthadaclassonceaweekthesefrequentitiescouldbeinterprettedoftwoinsteadbecauseinthatcaseclassisgoneeveryotherhoursandtherearealotssofasampleformulaprovidedherewouldapplyoxtotalnumberoffindingsbaseduponthefactorsmentionedaboveeight((xtimesused"
