Since only half (i.e., those not accounted by the 15 bees who came back) didn't return initially, we can calculate this remaining amount as follows: Total leaving initial period - Initially coming back / Rate multiplier due to repeated visitation = (Bees gone without their earlier comeback)/(Rate since twice folks took off)= ((30-(bees which just showed up)-15)+((2*(30+60))/(total numbers visited previously))) , finally getting rid of excess like zero terms above; simplifying further yields : -(60/original rate)*current count when considering repeat visits.=(-1)(60/90)*(30+(30%of original visitors recounting themselves plus newcomers), thus resulting int (-1)(60/90)*(30+(1/6).which becomes :-(0.66)*(40); therefore yielding approximately ::[-26]~nearest whole ",
