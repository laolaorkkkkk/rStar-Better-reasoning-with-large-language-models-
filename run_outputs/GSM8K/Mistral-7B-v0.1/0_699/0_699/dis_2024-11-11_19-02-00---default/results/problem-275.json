        " in the song (i.e., 54) times 'two', which equals 108; however multiply this result ('108') by 'one quarter' because three quarters aren\u2019t his lines, so it results into \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)x(108)=\u2018twenty seven and a half\u2019 or simply rounded up to \u2018twenty eight'. Next identify if any additional line need to be included within Scene One since we can not count half a line, rounding down instead yields twenty seven.

        " scenario. Divide this resultant amount (total line count) into three equal parts because it says \"a third\" which represents just him speaking these specific lines so divide it all again resulting therefore we obtain fourth part representing what fraction of total spoken words would refer specifically to our character. Calculate using above steps accordingly : Total Lines Scene One(=Twice Solo Song)=Total Lines Solo_Song*2 ;Fourth Part Of Total LinesSceneOne=(TotalLinesForSceneOne/3)/3; Four Fifth PartOf Line CountScenes Two ((LineCountSingal+6)(scenetwo))*(4/5); SumAllThreeTogether=(FirstPartFromPreviousStep)+SecondPart+(Thirdpartfrompreviousthree)-((LinetotalInSolosingle)*2). Substitute values based on details provided thereby calculating below: Twice Solosong equals Sixteen FortyEight .
