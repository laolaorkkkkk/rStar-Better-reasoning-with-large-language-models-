Therefore, it means John working hours sum up to(twice of sat)+(three times sun)=2x2+3x1=<<2*2+(3*1)=7>>7hours.(He was active thrice Sundays but only once Saturdays) To find the difference in payment amount, multiply these numbers ($10/hour)(jills_worktime\u2212johns_worktimes)=$((payrate)*[(two\u00d7totaljob_timessaturday)])-(two\u00d7(one \u00d7 jobtotaltimefriday)]))=(\u00a310\u00d7[2+(3\u00d71)])-(2\u00d7(1\u00d71)).

        " than what Jill spent which means john\u2019s work schedule was like this (assuming we use same unit): [John \u2013 Sat]:{x*2} ;[John\u2013 Sun]: {y/3}.According to their contractual agreement; Tabitha paid them both per hire rates amounting up to(or less) $10/hr so let us consider average wage rate over saturday$(W_j)=$[(2+X)*10]/ X=1+$ ((2)(10)/X).and accordingly $( W_o )=[{( y / 3)+ X}]*$(( 10))/(Y / 3)=1+( 3($X/$Y)).Since,$ X=( Y / 2)$ therefore:$ \\begin{cases}( Wa)_ O=$&=&1+( 3($(X/Y))$\\\\ & & \\\\( Wa)_ L=$ &=1+ ($_{(X/Y)}$)\\end{cases}$In order not only to find but also compare value earned it makes sense using either percentage or fractional scaled comparison .So ,let %Earnings~of~Lilly ~be~$P%_{l}=\\frac{$_{(Wa)}_{A}}{[$_{(WA)_{O}}]$}\\times  100=\\left(\\frac{ 1+\\frac{(X}{Y} }{\\dfrac { 1\\:(2)}{(X/(Y}))}}%-\\right)\\times  100&=[\\left(\\:\\frac {2}{(3)}\\::{:]\\frac{{X}}_{Y}}\\right)]\\%$\\Rightarrow P_{\\text{:Li}}= \\frac {2}{3}% Since,(WP_j)-WP_(LI)=\\frac{2}{3}- 1=- \\frac{1}{3}=(- 0.(333\u2026..))\\%=,- 33.\\overline{3} %Now lets examine result tabulated below :|Worker |Hours Worked      |Total Pay    ||-------|------------------|------------||Lilly       |         3        |    30 Dollars |Tony         |       6           |    180 Dollars ||Percent Gain|$ 0.33...<br />$-33..<sup>\u2219</sup><sub>(Relative\\;Rate\\,Of\\;Pay)$|$ 1$            $$Performance^{\\wedge}_{gain}>0$$As observed Tony made better monetary g",
        " respectively; hence both Saturdays this means John works (2*john saturday) and sunday(3* john_sunday). Hence equation becomes ($x+y)*hours*$perhour=$pay   or perhron=$Pay/Hrs . To find difference subtracting respective values $([$pay]-$[payment])=[$Perhronelectron]$[(John Total)] $[($Electron Hour)(Total Electron Weekly)$]. Using numbers we get [$30*(2+$3)]-$[30*(2/$)+1/$]=[]$. By solving further you can determine exact amount earned extra. We know however if using our original conditions , tabitha paid half hr rate so electron rates would need adjustment but not considered here just wanted methodology presented which when applied properly yields correct differential payment comparison via calculated variable differences upon computation & simplification process completed through appropriate steps towards provided problem solution goal thus clarifying reasoning path leading us eventually reaching desired outcome successfully fulfilling task requirements appropriately demonstrating required knowledge /understanding level capable being conveyed accurately within stated parameters accordingly maintaining integrity throughout entire resolution sequence ensuring thoroughness achieved regardless whether working alone individually amongst others collectively collaboratively whilst adhering strictly following set guidelines explicitly established specifications previously mentioned thereby providing satisfactory accurate result obtainable prompt efficiently yet effectively completing tasks assigned without errors made otherwise resulting inconclusive misconception confusion ultimately rendering lackadaisical attitude detrimental obstructing progress forward hindering effectiveness potential realizing true value inherent achievements worthwhile recognizes importance clear comprehension understanding necessary competence essential skill critical thinking strategies fundamental principles application practices pragmatic approaches holistic perspective integrative multidimensional approach utilization practical experience hands-on interaction tactics theoretical frameworks empirical research methods analytical tools conceptual models operational procedures efficient workflow optimization enhanced productivity performance measurement accountability metrics quality standards excellence benchmarks best practice recommendations continuous improvement lifelong learning development professional growth advancement personal satisfaction career aspirations individual accomplishments self-motivation discipline goals priorities commitment dedication ambition determination passion enthusiasm innovation creativity imagination inspiration ideas exploration discovery curiosity wonder investigation scientific inquiry experiment evaluation assess results analysis conclusion evidence based decisions informed choices responsible actions ethical conduct moral leadership character traits virtues habits behaviors patterns disciplined routine consistency focus attention concentration engagement"
