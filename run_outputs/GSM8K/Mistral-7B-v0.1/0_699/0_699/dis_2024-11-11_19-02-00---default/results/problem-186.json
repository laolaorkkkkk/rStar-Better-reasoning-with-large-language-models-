Since we don't need to consider those amounts separately because no amount specifically talks about it being divided evenly nor any information stating that this remaining quantity goes into different divisions, let us proceed as if every division gets them its proportionate share equally regardless whether it actually consumes differently due to lacking info suggesting so otherwise.

This means there would need to be (160 \u2013 88) / 6= roughly 11 extra bunches handed out specifically for the RATS or hams since their amounts per animal can vary while those particular species usually come as pairs but aren't individually measured here unlike what was mentioned about dogs which don't necessarily follow this pattern due them possibly having unique dietary requirements based upon breeds etc therefore not requiring additional monitoring beyond average consumption figures when assessing whether you could say such thing within general assumptions applicable across most domesticated feline families residing under typical home environmental constraints present throughout modern society yet further complicating matters whenever addressing specific feedings during distinctive instances involving multiple individuals engaged concurrently interactively over long durations resulting into potential shifts observed relative intake variations especially following introduction novel stimuli influencing social behaviors accordingly necessitating increased vigilance towards alteration(unusual patterns potentially indicating underlying health concern).
