To calculate exactly what percentage or dollar values would make up those totaled sums over any period requires specific dates or transaction details within our current context -- since none are provided here. Therefore, we cannot accurately pinpoint precisely whose share caused these discrepancies without further information about work hours completed versus remuneration agreements made via either verbal contract/agreement memoranda drafting post bargaining sessions conducted amongst labor unions vs employee representatives negotiating terms & conditions regarding job satisfaction criteria including pay scales correlated directly back towards their hour commitments vis-\u00e0-vis employers aiming maintain competitive edge market position against rival enterprises while simultaneously striving attainability profit margins maximization objectives beyond mere financial proficiency alone but overall operational efficiency across production departments ensuring continual growth sustained long term strategies development plans align company vision statement transformative goals targets accomplishment benchmarks measurable success indicators set forth upon foundations established principles ethics conduct guidelines governance structures leadership team members board directors committee chairperson executive officer general manager chief operating officer finance director human resources operations supervisor administrative support technician engineer maintenance personnel representative lawyers consultants auditors external advisory council peers colleagues industry experts customers suppliers partners investors creditors regulatory bodies community organizations nonprofits academicians research institutes scholarship holders patrons artists performers activists entrepreneurs innovators inventors creators discoverers explorers adventurers travelers tourists visitors observers spectators listeners participants engagers collaboraters mediators facilitators coaches mentors trainers instructors teachers educators parents disciplinarians guardians protectors defenders heroes legends ancestors descendant lineages generations families bloodlines tribes cultures civilizations nations world history timeline past present future dream tomorrow yesterday every moment lifetime eternity universe cosmos galaxy solar system stars planets moons asteroids comets meteoroids nebula galaxies black hole singularity string theory particle physics wave mechanics classical thermodynamics quantum field theory relativistic dynamics algebra geometry topology complex analysis numerical methods computational algorithms software engineering",

To find out if any cash remained unaccounted for check resulting difference against expected regular base salary less extra compensation obtained; work backwards assuming every dollar except hers came solely thanks too overtime hours worked rather than missing funds since nothing else could explain why these sums exceed predefined expectations based upon previous calculations shown previously within same scenario without using those mentioned variables otherwise one might miss crucial information affecting said outcome namely perhaps taxes being deducted early thereby impacting reported amounts once complete processing takes place thus leaving discrepancies among various types depending what method used whether calculating manually vs software application etc.. Calculate remaining unknown payment via addition following below steps: Additional Earnings(X), Wages Received($W_r=$300)= End Balance$E+$ Starting Balance$B,$where X+Y=Z .
