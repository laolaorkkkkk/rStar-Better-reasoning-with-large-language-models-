STEP BY STEP HOW TO FIND THEIR CURRENT AGES Step 1: Represent Their Current Age Differences Using Variables Let\u2019s represent Sophia\u2019s age as `S` and Chloe\u2019s age as `C`. Given that Sophia (S) is currently twice as old as Chloe (C), our first equation becomes:  ",
        " find out Charmaine's current age first before answering about future ages. Since it said that charmaine would turn 16 when u reach next year , currently (last year) shes was less than sixteen . By subtracting 'next year'' difference(12year), this implies last year :  16-12= <<16-12=4>> 4yrs.(as per problem statement). Thus adding four decades as asked within question so 4+4 yr becomes same thing like saying say what happened one calendar or any period ago ie..past but still its not equal zero change just reposition around place holder here past vs near right ? Likewise if we add these value ..so again 4-(in present)+4 which simply means you move upward direction toward your actual situation/present status meaning finally taking into consideration starting point i made above plus newly introduced shift towards immediate perspective resultant addition leads us back downside line making sure our return journey follows proper directions ! That leaves another path called Option B whose equation looks similar too except instead startpoint being changed due lack experience using alternate methodology...thus solving puzzle via conventional linear movement keeping intact original scenario remains unaltered despite seemingly different routes chosen while retaining accuracy levels obtained earlier calculated under option D mentioned initially....Which indicates both options ultimately yield consistent answers even though their paths differ slightly depending upon applied strategy employed during calculations hence proving validity behind utilizing distinct approaches whenever possible ; however none prove incorrectness nor discrepancies exist among them albeit certain scenarios might warrant slight modifications based off prevailing circumstances thus ensuring precision stays high throughout entire process!

        " Charmaine will be 16 (in future) which means currently it\u2019s less than this \u2013 since time before current moment is past so subtracting those 12 years =>  16 - 12 , thus age right now will be **future_age** minus these additional **past_years**.

Therefore, if she becomes 16 in 12 years, currently (i.e., subtracting those remaining 12 year period), she would be only (16 \u2013 12) which makes her being present or right now as 4 yrs older i.e. 16 plus another four making up exactly sixteen minus twelve equals Four times two so ultimately make it eight. Since we knew earlier charmaine was going to become eleven summing all these facts into consideration one can simply put forward this simple equation X+ Y= Z therefore Eight(X)=sixteen Minus Twelve(Y).
