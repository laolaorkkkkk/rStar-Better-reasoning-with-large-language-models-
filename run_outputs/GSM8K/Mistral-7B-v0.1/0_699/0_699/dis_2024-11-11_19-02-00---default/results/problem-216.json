Thanks for understanding \u2013 let me provide a clearer breakdown suitable for someone new to these concepts. When dealing with financial transactions such as loan repayments, what matters most first is knowing exactly how much needs to be returned fully to clear debts. Imagine buying something expensive but don\u2019t want all those payment instalments hanging around forever. Well, banks allow us usually either smaller regular amounts paid periodically until our initial purchase cost is gone completely, ensuring everyone knows their cash flow isn't disrupted too severely while still covering expenses properly enough not leave anyone waiting excessively before getting own stuff settled once and for all.
