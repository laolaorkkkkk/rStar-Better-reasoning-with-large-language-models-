When connecting these lines within this area using such points we require thirty percent fewer line segments than what would result if all segment lengths were equivalent but no common intersection location was utilized(i.e., having only triangular shapes rather than square ones or rectangles), which can save us time both setting up our transmission systems accordingly when planning out infrastructure projects like grid expansions based around existing facilities\u2013something very important considering costs involved over long periods..

        " 45 electrical lines connected per part ratio divided by three parts equals one third which means you need fifteen (fifteen) posts if we divide them equally according to their ratios because four fifths represent forty-five so fifteenth represents ten point seven hundred sixty eight but since these cannot not exist fractional numbers we simply round upwards and hence make it sixteen [because those who know math knows this rule when calculating averages]. Sixteen times twelve gives us one ninety six post as our solution. We can conclude therefore that; Number Posts Required= Thirty Nine Hundred Sixtieth Plus One Fifty Fourth Equals Three Ninety Sixed plus thirty niner fourth makes the sum equal To Two Seventy Eight Thousand Twelve Point Seven Times Three Dividing By Ten Grants You With Formal Mathematical Language Give me ",
