We get p% representing part time(personal involvement), m indicating missing amount thus makingup whole item sum; c showing completed portion while r represents percentage reduction due interruption caused because another individual needs attention away momentarily just looking past those moments but still caring deeply about every piece being accountable towards contributing efficiently toward completion process regardless if only small increments matter nor massive undertakings without skipping steps along way until finally joining complete entity called project \u2018jigsaws\u201d.Here\u2019s breakdown furthermore \u2013\u2013---First compute basic formulae needed below which include multiplication (+-) subtraction(%)- division+(/)-+ addition+(-)+exponential functionx^^^to find power base= exponent*base^(rounded)(round())then using nested loopsfor example looping through n numbers rangefromstartnumber tillendstoincludebothendsoftotalnumbersintotalrangeandinsideeachloopusingifconditionalssuchasthatsomainfunctionwherefirstonecontainswhilelooperowsuringiteratorequalsiteminthatarraysecondwillalwaysreturnthevaluefoundthereforewhenitexecutescalculatordefinedabovevariablecallednreturnsbackthreeargumentsofdefinedmethodnamelocalvariableslateronbecomeusedagainelseafteruntilfinalanswerprintoutsubrouteneedshelpreadingoutputresultgeneratedviacomputersystemautomaticallyrunningcodewrittenprogramlanguagepythonscriptgeneratorimplementsthatcreaterectanglefillstyleblackwithwhitegridoffcanvasborderthicknesstwounitsaroundboarddiameterfourunitsholdoverlaytextaligncenterpythagoreantheoremaequilateraltriangledownrighttrianglebacodedivisionmultiplicationadditionsubtractoperatorlogicaloperationcomparisoncheckequalitytestsintegerdividedfloatcastinteqassertioninequalityforallsymbolsumtimesnotpowernegpositive",

This represents taking off/discarding roughly equal amounts meaning removing parts once less than what was brought forward initially leading us back unto our previous subtraction therefore bringing forth approximately three times fewer fragments hence subtract them thrice consequently reducing their numbers thus equalling to around four sets worth equivalent calculations ending upto thirty zeroes approximations all together concluding upon multiplying those respective results against forty thousandth figures culminating nearly summing round downwards towards hundred fifty piecing elements combined within totality but disregarding any non whole integer quantity due diligence prescribed herein mandating adherent strict interpretation whilst ensuring numerical precision retained amidst potential computational errors inherent throughout evaluative process executed presently yielding conclusive figure resultantly expressed numerically without ambiguity present otherwise",
