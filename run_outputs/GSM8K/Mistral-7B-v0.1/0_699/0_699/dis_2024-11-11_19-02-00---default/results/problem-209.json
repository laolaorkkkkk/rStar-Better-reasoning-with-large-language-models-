Finally subtract those figures ($3000-$240=$2760) equals $1200, which corresponds to our initial information stating 'twenty four hundred'. Thus solving using inverse operations helps us verify if these values indeed fit into what was shared initially.

        " price per hundred items. We know about costs prices : $$60/plate$$ & $$1.5/$cup(we calculate this value as our system requires it). Since we need to find their common base units which here represents cents so divide values into respective denominations , i.e. [($60*10)*$2 + ($1.5*$10)] means dividing all numbers including dollar symbols into 'cents'. This way your target equation goes like follows:$[${[((((60x10)/{2}$)+{(1.5+1)}))$*{10}}]$ or simplify further $({{((300))}+({2.5})})$*$10= {{eq}}$325\\cdot{1}{} {/eq}, meaning you get ${ eq}$_{Final}={${\\text{[}(325)$]} {/eq}.
