To get this total sum we combine them all together like so ;$12+43+15+4+22=$ \\text{_} $. By performing operations additively combining values you find out she totaled exactly :$\\text{__}=$$\\text{:}$$$.Now take what was calculated above which shows us precisely ,however exactely it comes to or says \"$\"and divide through equally among those who contributed into buying these items i.e.. Isabellss mother/daughter duo and herself one third away would mean dividing your previous value obtained(totaling price of everything acquired just prior!)into $(three)/(one)$ since its stated here explicitly in question statement about splitting costs equally amongst themselves via sharing etc.:$(a)(b)=(\\textit{\\frac{(third)}{(one}})$And substitutue our earlier result foundout abovemultiplying both sides inside brackets using associative property while keeping variables outside intact:\"((third))=(dividedvalue))$So finally calculating such division simply brings along following solution:$^{___}\\cdot {_{({})}_{}}= _{}^{_{}}(multipliedtototalsumofpriceofallthingsobtainedabove)\\qquad.$$^^^= ^^+ ^{__(valuesyouwantthefinalresltin)}$You can see equation structure written without mathematical symbols hence leaving interpretation open however logic behind method laid down remains unalterably sound if not changed!

        " on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags; therefore we can add all those numbers up (this includes our units/significant figures) as follows:$12+$43+$15+$4+$22=$96$We know this was shared equally amongst herself and both of her parent(s), so divide it appropriately.$96\\div3=32$$Each person paid $\\boxed{32}.$. This means that if you buy something together instead of separately you could save quite significantly ($1 over per item or around $1 every few purchases). That makes sense but I never would just because shopping alone provides opportunities for solitude / introspection etc.... However buying items while your company costs not only get lessened when group discount applies however time may actually increase productivity vs spending solo thus increasing overall efficacy rates ; furthermore although collective decision making processes might result into compromise situations among various stakeholders yet ensures greater cohesion within groups thereby creating stronger bonding experiences which help foster personal relationships.. Nonetheless individualistic approaches tend towards optimizing resource utilization hence promoting self satisfaction levels despite potential drawback involved like isolation induced stress! To conclude : my take away here probably involves prioritising quality first before considering quantity especially regarding products needed daily use examples being food snacks medicinal needs essential clothing accessories basic appliances tools vehicle repair materials packaging storage necessities household furniture comfort living environment hobbies sports activities social gatherings entertainment events fitness routines education profession work business transactions communication devices transport equipment travel accommodations housing investments financial planning savings strategies retirement funds insurance healthcare benefits employment legal services estate administration realty properties inheritance matters property rights intellectual pursuits literary creativity art exhibitions photography filmmaking musical performances dance ballet opera choir gospel music concerts recital series festivals carnivals fairs expos .

        "$. Since she divided this expenditure equally among herself and her two parent (three people), you divide it into thirds which comes out as $\\frac{86}{3}\\approx$ 28.67 so approximately \\$29 when rounded up was paid per persons if we include cent units. This means none dollar bill can precisely account for everyone share but close approximation would require either rounding off or additional monetary unit like coins(cents). But since question demanded exact amounts only using whole numbers here goes $$\\frac{86 }{3}=$$ $$=28\\text{\\,\\,\\,(rounded)\\,,}$$ hence not fully inclusive yet consider one extra half i.e., .$05$\\ ($=\\,$ Cents) makes us closer & thus becomes   \\[ \\frac{86}{\\color{blue} {2}} =\\color{"
