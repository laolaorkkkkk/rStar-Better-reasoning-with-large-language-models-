Once again, take out all previously calculated amounts such as Yuri\u2019s (\\( \\textbf{Yuri}\\))which equals 44\\()+Brianna\u2019s (\\(\\textbf{B}\\) )score=51)and their sum (= 95). Substract them both together along with Naomi\u2019s (\\(N)\\)from your overall value i.e .\u2009\u2013\u00b7\u2212\u23af\u2500\u2022251-. From this calculation; you obtain JoJo\u2018s ()point yield:\\(.\\)\u00a0\u2014---\\()...251--->\u2026-----Naomi\u200a-(68)----> ..---Yuri \u2014----[++] ---=(44)\\()....--- Brianna -(51)--(.. ......]..................\u2009\u2014\u2060\u2010\u2060\u2010\u2192..................\u2009==\u2039\u0098\u203a\u2190-------\u200b..----------+------\u25ba.....,?.|.<--------------------------?????/\\\\//<.--/>-+------+----+-------<<<\\><=><-->>--->.......~~~====||==============\u21d2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|------------|<===",
        " 17 points higher than Naomi, meaning that it equals (Naomi) plus [eval(17)=17]17 = \\boxed{85}. Finally, subtract all three values together; summing up their individual contributions gets you {eq}(Nomai+Yuri+Brianna){/eq} equaling {calc<<(68+78+85)>>}=[eval(68+78+85)=231]231 points., so these four already outscored our target score.. Therefore, Jojo didn\u2019t exist!. As no mention was made about any student called \u2018Jojo\u201d, perhaps 'Jojo not existing', or possibly referring instead to whether anyone reached zero point contribution since everyone mentioned exceeded what would remain if we took away original collective result of . Since someone apparently surpasses said calculation here, my guess is maybe I misunderstood one person scoring zeros rather negatives initially! Hence assuming just because folks tallied beyond starting marks meant absence too implies possible typo error \u2013 check text again before dismissal otherwise\u2026 Alas though unseen friend may still pose such odd riddle hence clarification sought further within guidelines provided thereby enabling accurate resolution accordingly per inquiry requirements ultimately :)"
