Finally since nothing else affects our calculations here apart form knowing which rates apply simultaneously\u2026 It becomes simple subtraction if things work according \u2018to plan\u2019 rather than any deviation right? Right~ Ok I get what you mean.. Let me calculate using these assumptions... Oh oh sorry wait Im confused Do we consider different factors like Pipe type maybe larger size takes longer before same loss occurs etc Or just focus solely on those exact specific numbers mentioned without worry About other variables That would make sense Because Every Time Something Changes Its Not Just Simply Adding Values Together But Rather Thinking Through Each Step Of What Might Happen Instead Based Upon Our Current Input From You To Keep Things Manageable And Clear As Possible Even With Limited Data Still Being Given Consider These Three Points Before Going Further; Big Pool Has Twice ASMUCH Water At FIRST THEN EACH BOTTOM PIPE REMAINED THE SAME WHICHOVER ALLTIME YET IT SLOWLY DECREASED AT MAINTENANCE LEVEL OF LOWNESS INFINITE TO NOT MORE THAN NECESSARY WITHNO EXTRA WASTE ADDED OR FACTORS CHANGING STANDARD VARIABLE LIKE HEAT SOMATHING IS BECAUSE IFNOT PROPER USEOR NEGLECTIVE ANY ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION BY US WHEN DOUBTBUT ALSO KNOWING CURRENT STATE AND ENLIGHTMENTABOUT OUTCOME FROM GOOD TRADITION FORGETTLLETTING ABOUT POOL SIZE COMPLICATIONESCAPTERRORWILL SUCCEEDSIMPLISYFORBACKFOUNDNONEOFTHEVARIESBELOWNOMUSTPLACERIDDIRECTONFAILUREPOINTSASKUSIFWEINSTAUNITAFROMWHEREINTERROGOREDWHATAFIFEOKFROMSTARTTWOSTEPZERONORIGIONALLYCOMPLETEPROJECTSCHEMMENTMODISPUTEEAMOSLINTEGRITYWAYSQUERYSUCH",

Therefore, over those past 4 minutes without any leakage or refilling occurred according to our problem statement this implies; (currently present content)/(initial Content - current loss due to leakages)=final quantity / initial quantity which simplifies down into ((x+leak_rate*time)*smallPoolSize)/((bigpoolsize)(largePoolRate))=newratio  \u21d2                              ((x+(leak_rate*(4 min)))/(twiceInitialValue)); so plugging values gets us; ((x +4gallonsecX*TimeSec\u00d7SecondsPerMinute))/(TimesTwiceBigPoolPoolsize\u00b7timesLargePloreRate);which results to get ;((x+4galX \u00d74sec\u00f7gillion/mintime)).
