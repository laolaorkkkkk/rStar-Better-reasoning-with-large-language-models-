Thus determine actual distances covered during these last couple of days based off initial data. Calculate average daily mileage using information regarding third week. Finally sum up cumulative miles spent throughout entire journey including both weeks combined.

Stepwise interpretation starts with considering duration timespans \u2013 \u2018two weeks long\u2018 breaks down into 'the First Week(within its own separate segment)' & 'Second Weeks'. Within mentioned timeline, individual actions such as activities ('travel', etc.) can be associated onto respective distinct calendar intervals('fourdays','next twentyonehours').
