Assume standard serving size without considering varying measurements among containers used throughout example context),(Note exception include drink dilution via evaporation etc.(elevated temperatures typically reduce density thus slightly enhancing perceived flavor intensity).. Hence focus attention towards actual mass loss attributed mainly related specifically linked toward physical state transformations involving solids&liquids substances undergoing phase change transitions particularly melting point equilibria occurrences leading shifts away equilibrium points relative vapor pressures governing system dynamics,(including boiling phenomena associated energy requirement differential calculations required whenever involved solid crystalline structures transition phases thereby necessitated expenditure power necessary sustaining specified conditions prevention premature precipitation events resulting suboptimal product quality diminishment)).

It might help if someone knows better details around why such phenomenon occurs; could potentially deepen our understanding beyond mere experimental evidence based principles like Boyle law/Charles equation mentioned before.. First though let me rephrase question so far : Is addition of solids always directly proportional no matter what substance used ? Next consider scenario again keeping above fact clear first thing becomes easier since any additional non dissolving material present won\u2018t affect concentration anymore hence remaining constant therefore simplifying calculation process immensely thus reducing possible errors resulting erroneous answers obtained otherwise without considering relevant formulas involved!

Because no matter what type of drink, you add liquids; It decreases its strength hence our result would simply depend upon amount of fluids being stirred into the concoction i.e., here addition made was 15 mL therefore iciness increased resulting(ice decrease+liquid increase)=negative net change Hence overall effectivity lower down became ,i.e,-(-60)+15=-45mL less potent.(We consider negative sign since volume increases not reduced).
