With every set yielding ten (10) finished product , Katy receives  3 times 10 products . This amount becomes equal again to only thirty (30).Since it takes just over half an hour to bake fifty(50)crayon candies,this results in fortyfive(45) sold ones considering ninety percent sale success rate respectively resulting in nearly $1.5x kate\u2019s earning i.e., approximately seventy seven point oh five ($ 77 ).
