Subtract your savings from the initial charge..$30 subtracted from $100 leaves you with $70 as the actual cost John pays following their special deal. Thus, if John initially plans to pay only full priced without any deals or promotions it would mean spending all \"$100.\" But because they provided a concessionary offer specifically tailored towards first time customers such as himself who could avail themselves off said 'promotion'.
