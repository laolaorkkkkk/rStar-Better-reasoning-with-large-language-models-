Museum tour goes twice as long as the previous activity which was a cooking class so it would equal six hours because double length equals doubling time duration hence , 3x2=6hrs. Lastly, we add up these four amounts : 1+3+.5+6=. Here our resultant unitary value comes out to be ten halves.

To conclude our calculations; We first established timings through simple multiplication operations such as calculating thrice something means multiplying said thing by 3 while deriving halves needs division like cutting numbers down into equal parts hence dividing them by two etc., subsequently adding these amounts yielded us eight units being signified via numerical terms known universally amongst individuals regardless their geographic positionality therefore coming up short only slightly because although not mentioned whatsoever yet evidently still holds true whilst present information remains consistent throughout discussion thus far!
