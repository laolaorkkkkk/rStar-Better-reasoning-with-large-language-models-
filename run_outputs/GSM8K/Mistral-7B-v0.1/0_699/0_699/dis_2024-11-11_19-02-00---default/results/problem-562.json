Therefore if we know initially Pyramid angles 32 degrees down from horizontal/ground , even though Sun moved 50 degree vertically since our initial line was already angled . When calculating what your new position would look like visually considering perspective still applies because objects don't pop out as flat images appear; so subtracting 32(degree)= <<32-50=-18>>-. Since negative can not represent real physical direction i take abs(-)-which equate us back closer to original base level hence |angle| =abs(-18) which means either positive version without sign -(+):  18 Degrees forward into space instead..

To find out what happens exactly as requested instead would require complex trigonometric functions taking into account both Earth rotation around itself whilst maintaining constant speed due east along surface not considering changes caused my gravitational pull nor alterations resulting from orbit curvature effects! It becomes evident through such reasoning why understanding angular motion using simple ratios alone proves insufficient here---mathematical calculations involving spherical coordinate systems etc..
