First store requires 20 roses ,second store demands 15, while last one needs  30 . Total needed would thus become (20+15+30)==65 This means that these firms demand altogether 65 flowers but since ford only produces 40 we can find out just how short it falls as follows; difference here i.e deficit=actual required \u2013 actual supplied or ((no.(total demanded)- no(supplied))). Hence,(65-(40*4 weeks)).Since its said four times over so you multiply by them multiplying factor which was already determined earlier when calculating their yearly intake [(65/(40*4))]=(65/160)or simply put dividing by 160 gets us 0.4 rounded up becomes full unit hence resultant output equals ten units less therefore being unable to fulfill their desired requests adequately without extra rose cultivation [remember rounding off].
