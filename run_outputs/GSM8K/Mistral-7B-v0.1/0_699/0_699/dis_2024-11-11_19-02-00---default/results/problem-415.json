        " get any apple from those types, it means Joanne picked all of these apples alone. Therefore, Joanne only collected apples form the average trees which leaves us to find out what quantity X represents (apples from average trees). Since both their contributions add up to 500 apples altogether, and knowing every other value except our unknown variable 'X', here's one possible method you could follow : [(Joanne's Tall Trees Apples) + (Joanne's Short Tree Apples)]+ [((Twice As Much From Same Type Of Tree Gather By Sister ) + ((Thrice Such Amount From Another Similar Kind Collected))]/[Total Number Both Broke Up]. Thus filling data into formula looks like --[(30 + 15)+(x+(doubleofitsame))] /[  500], making equation look something similar to--[[15+DoubleOfIt]+TripleOne] /[   500]=[] ,so if replace DoubleAndTripoleWith Their Rough Mean It gets--- [[15*4/2]+([mean]*3)/][    500= [] or [ 30+]]/(500=[ ] ],but problem didn't state about numbers regarding same kind being doubled&trippled respectively hence replacing said variables directly would not work . This approach might prove difficult without actual quantities mentioned thus maybe revisiting initial information may result better solution.-->>we can see that when I replaced everything unknowable immediately according info presented in query --->,formula turns incorrect too due reason stated above..i am stuck :-(.
