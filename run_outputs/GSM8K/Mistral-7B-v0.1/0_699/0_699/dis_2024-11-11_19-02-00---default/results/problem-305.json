Therefore we calculate losses using fractions (or decimals depending upon preference). Specifically, if you consider percentages as proportions/fractional values relative to one whole unit(i.e., 1), it would translate mathematically into multiplication process hence; convert 80% (to decimal form i.e. .8) multiplied (.8 X 20 ) equals eighteen defeated individuals thus leading us towards conclusion about victories versus defeats meaning nineteen perished matches because initially stated seventeen competed against but none was overpowering due to competent performances by our main contestant.
