        " the 1959 Penny which means it weights .75 times as heavy or (48*.75) so its (.30 )grain heavier than one quarter. That brings their individual weights up top . 1/4*(4*48=+12), plus additional .3(for four quarters)(4\\*1)=-.1). Thus , our totals become; [(.60)+(-.1)]=.5 Grains per quarter. Since you want twelve copper items out over eighteen silver ones. I just take these values apart into halves. Silver gets half.(8/.2=-.4); Coppers get double this amount:(~.8.) This becomes eighty cents worth of coinage.; ~1. /quarter & also ~8./fourth-(as above!)
