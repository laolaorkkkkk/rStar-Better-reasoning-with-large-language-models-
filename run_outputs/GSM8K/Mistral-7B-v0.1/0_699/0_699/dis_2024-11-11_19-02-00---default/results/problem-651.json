        " red hat sales, we know that means twice as much because one plus another equals three (or divided into third parts). To get this value multiply $400 \u00d7 2 which results in $800.. Multiply these values together using multiplication since you want to find their combined contribution ($400 +$800) \u2022    You can also use addition here ,but multiplication makes less sense due to space complexity than when performing multiplications vs additions ..

Half times something equals itself divided evenly into two parts; therefore, Green hat revenue is equal to Red Hat plus themselves ($400+$400=$800) or doubled income since red cost twice less than greens. Total Greens Hats\u2019 Sales would thus equate it out together with their respective shares yielding a ratio value set up like so G=2R which translates here into G=$800 , R=$400 .
