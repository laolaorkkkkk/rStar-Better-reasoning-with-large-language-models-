        " one mamba has 70/2=<<70/2=35>>35 spots. We need to calculate the total amount of spots both snakes together would make if we consider their respective populations (cobras having doubled representation). This means adding up individual contributions based off population size first \u2013 so multiply those spot counts by amounts mentioned earlier before summation; this results into getting [the product(spots_per_mamba)*population_of_mambas]+[the product(spots_on_a_single_cobra)*number_of_cobras]= ((35*60)+(70*40)=<<35*60+70*40=5400>>5400 total points altogether..Then divide them equally amongst members present i.e.,((total sum)/(count)), or simply put divided evenly among individuals equals about::([points/(individuals)]=(5400/100) approximated downwards it\u2019ll still come out very close but not exactly like\u2026so just simplify right away using fractions here instead!!

Cobras contribute (70)(40) =  2800 spots, whereas mambas add up (140)(60) = 8400 spots; therefore, combining both types yields a sum of 2800+8400=11200 total spots amongst them altogether. Divide this value into halves since we need it divided evenly due to instruction. Half of 11200 equals",

Divide it equally among them so we take our original sum dividing its value over 2 or taking its average like $(sum/number)$, ending up in getting $.5 \\times (\\text{Total Spot Count})$. Calculate $\\frac{\\text{Spot Total}}{2}$. Therefore, calculating yields .$(11,200 / 2)$. Which calculates into about, $5,600$. But since exact values aren\u2019t asked let us keep only one digit past decimal point resulting in approximately around , $5,600$, thus rounding down because we can not assume fractional spot count; hence finally yielding exactly   ** "
