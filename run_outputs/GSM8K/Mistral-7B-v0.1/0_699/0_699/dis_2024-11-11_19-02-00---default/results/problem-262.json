Here this amounts to **`(Box Count)*(`CountPerUnit`)**`, or `(5)(50)`. Calculation yields `numberOfMarbles=250`. We also know she adds additional units -- here it says `'her friend gives her'` 20 new ones; again following our formula lets call them as gift('gift'), while still keeping their definition (**`'some_value')`). To get current quantity (`current`), add gifts ('+' operator). Final calculation results in `$final=$(initial)+($gifts)`, resulting in `\"$total=$marbles+$new\". Substituting real values into these placeholders would look like \"$total=(5*(50))+(20)\" yielding resultant $(250+20)=$(270)$ meaning currently ($afterAddition='before'+'$changes') ,or \"`Total=\" before\" plus changes =\" changeQuantity\"` .
