Next, notice that Alice decided to share half or equally among herself (\"give\" implies sharing). Half means dividing what you initially possessed into equal parts represented mathematically via division; therefore, Halving $(160)/$(1 piece) results in $(160 divided by 2)or $(80 remainder zeroes.) meaning ali still possesses $(80 following this transaction process.
