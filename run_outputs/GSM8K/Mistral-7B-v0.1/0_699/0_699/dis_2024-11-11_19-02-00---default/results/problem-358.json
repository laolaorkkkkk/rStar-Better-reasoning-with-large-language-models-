        " $1/day * 5days=$5 over 5 days. Therefore Marisa puts $5 /$5= 1 dollar into savings (the remainder goes towards purchasing other things). The answer is: 1.",
        " which means over 5 days; hence altogether it sums up to 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25$. But out this amount ,we need only savings ; therefore we subtract our saving i.e  5$ . Thus what remains (i.e., 25$-5) would equal to ($<<25-5=20>>). Therefore according my calculations marisa puts into her piggy bank 20 dollar equals $(20),which was not among your options! I am sorry you chose wrong option provided but correct one here(as calculated earlier)=$(20). Please try again next time.(Because due to rounding off process even though exact result comes out same its presented value may differ ) Hence following above mentioned calculation procedure finally selecting '$20'. Correct ",
        " This means she spends 4 (lollipops) * .25 (cost/each) = $1 daily on lollipops herself. That leaves another dollar saved ($5-$1=$4), but only half this amount comes directly out of their weekly allowance\u2014$2 over four weeks or one extra fifty cent piece thrown into her piggy bank each month instead. Over time these savings build up exponentially due to interest generated upon deposit when placed within banks such as Citigroup Inc., Bank Of America Corp etc.; thus increasing wealth beyond just purchasing power alone while maintaining sound fiscal habits established during adolescence through responsible adult living later years..

        " lollipop (4*0.25) equals 1 dollar spent on lollipops daily; therefore subtract this amount ($1), what you get ($4). This means Marisa saved $4 instead of spending all her income since saving includes just half of it [($(5-$1)-$5)] when multiplied by the duration, here being 5 days ([(-$(4)*5)], ends up equaling $-20 but negative amounts cannot exist concerning physical possessions thus resulting into having no possession hence 'None'. We can conclude because we assume only one transaction made throughout those 5 days regardless other possible transactions or purchases etc.. "
