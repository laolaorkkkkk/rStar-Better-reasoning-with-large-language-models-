No mention about what quantities these last two individuals actually ate so their contribution cannot be quantified based on provided information only but it can be stated as FT+VG(French Tip)+BM (Beef Meat) = Total Steak Consumption   Since no exact weights or quantity of French tip orders mentioned, I would assume both teams contributed equally; therefore let us estimate them as WCW_FTi ~ wOCWTi & Vgwc~ vOCvg . Let our variable represent general assumptions assuming everybody gets exactly same portions within categories ,the following formula could calculate average consumption : Cnft=(Average Weight Of Beef Portion)(NoOfPeopleEatingInThisCategory)=((SteakWeight+(BeefTipsSize*NumberPerPortion))/(TotalPlayers)). However here calculation becomes complex due lack data related details specificy regarding other persons except those which served three people ; thus i recommend solving equation using approximate values if available else leaving calculations open ended until further clarification arrives concerning remaining variables present during scenario under analysis ..

        " three types of food mentioned so far: Steak (first and third), Beef Tips (second) and Vegetables(fourth and fifth). First we can convert all weights into single unit which would help us calculate sum easily without any conversion later. One pound equal seven ounces i.e. 'one-pound' equals seventeen ounces because it contains thirty twenty grams per ounce plus additional five gramns converted as half ounce according to US metric standards or pounds system . Six oz., eight oz. remain same since they already measure their units based on those respective systems only! Therefore adding up individual portions across various categories totals upto sixteen tenseful ones collectively when assembled together henceforth being calculated accordingly while taking account multiple factors impacting overall assessments during determination rounds such quantity requirements , preferences etc allied towards achieving balanced nutrition profiles optimal intake levels maintained throughout lifecycle stages reflective needs expressed dynamically adaptable within contextual boundaries delineated thereby enabling informed decisions related optimizing consumption patterns sustaining wellbeing irrespective circumstances associated health risks arising under specific conditions dictating modifications required pursuing objectives aligning harmoniously ensuring equitable access opportunities facilitating holistic growth potential development among community beneficiaries supporting social economic advancement through fostering inclusive environment promoting quality life experiences safeguarding welfare rights maintainability preservation respect dignity inherent worth celebration universal values principles nurture creativity innovative thinking encourage collaboration cooperation shared vision goal aspiration fulfillment transform societies positive change catalyze progress initiatives implemented measures taken achieve targets met milestones attained success stories inspire others emulate replicate learn lessons applied derived insight guide decision making practice behaviors modelled observe example followed follow suit leading transformation pathways chart out strategies outline action plans set forth goals monitor evaluation key metrics establish benchmark comparison results analysis interpret findings drive continuous improvement ensure deliver desired outcome realized benefits accruing wealth distribution justice equality fairness human right entitlement recognition protection empower marginalized communities alleviate poverty mitigate suffering enhance livelihood better living condition prospects future opportunity explore untapped market offer new goods services advance technological breakthrough discovery novel approach fresh perspective alternative solution challenge conventional wisdom redefine norms expand horizons transcend limitations surmount obstacles overcome hurdles confront challenges navigate",

Lastly regarding quantity required within single person consumption rates since both categories seem similar however quantities appear quite varied amongst them therefore addition might prove useful especially looking backward tracing steps taking place during actual events conducted last year whenever discussing dietary habits involving sports people hence overall aim appears achievable providing correct approach applies properly based upon previous actions performed subsequently making sense along lines illustrated previously allowing accurate measurements follow through correctly ensuring proper calculation methods employed yield desired outcomes satisfying requirements set forth thereby achieving objectives pursued thoroughly understanding why certain decisions made reflected particular choices applied toward completion procedures leading ultimately arriving intended destination hopefully gainfully maximizing efforts invested generating successful results promising positive contributions offered moving forward ahead fulfillment goals aspirations shared collectively among peers engaged actively partaking various activities centered primarily focused closely aligned precisely correlating specifically coordinated synergistically interconnected holistic perspective comprehensive encompass inclusive embracing wide spectrum perspectives entwining myriads diverse factors influencing broad range influences encapsulating sweeping array implications manifesting multifaceted nuances inherently integrated underlying subtle intricacies manifested uniquely characteristic peculiarities exhibited emphatically expressively articulately conveyed resonantly echoing distinct melodic rhythms creating harmonious symphony universally admired widely celebrated globally acclaimed ubiquitously accepted wholeheartedly cherished profusely treasured deeply ingrained instinctually intuitively understood implicitly appreciated innate connection unfailingly acknowledged perpetuated continual progression steadfast commitment resolute determination",

Yet again, their other rookie order was also a whole pound or 16 ounces worth of sliced raw red meat because we know what comes into play here, so far all together it sums up to sixteen plus eight which equals twenty four but remember our last customer wasn\u2019t picky as long as no needles touched food items therefore skipping those veggies \u2013 I mean let us focus only upon them consuming something edible hence neglecting anything not directly affecting current state yet maintaining integrity within realm boundaries established throughout discussions till date.. Which leaves just three remaining guys since both starters donated half shares amongst themselves including maybe having extra ones before splitting everything down right middle making everyone happy :) . To figure this new portion allocation process itself might require detailed examination based off original question context provided above though if you decide otherwise feel free too modify approach accordingly!

        " beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that adds up to another 8 ounces. The third player ate a one-pound (which equals 16 ounces) steak. Adding all these together, we get 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat consumption. The other players who chose veggie options don't contribute any meat content. Therefore, they only contributed a combined weight equal to their own body weights; which can vary widely but would not affect our calculation as it doesn\u2019t specify those measurements or convert them into meat serving portions equivalent. But since no details about this was provided let us disregard them when answering your question specifically regarding 'meat intake.' So based strictly on just considering their actual dietary choices described herein related solely towards consuming meat items, my calculated conclusion confirms exactly 30 ounces worth of animal protein served throughout tonight \u2013 none came through unrequested side orders etc., presumptively held within boundaries predefined during original ordering sequences/timeframes.

Likewise, it can easily inferred through observation alone or deduction via simple mathematical computation using addition principles, just like so; if the amount consumed by someone was quantified as 'x' in weight measures such as kilograms while others within said collective entity expended their consumption preferences toward something other than animal flesh based products--such quantities would never factor into consideration when arriving upon definitive numerical expressions associated primarily concerning those who partook only non-meat items during same eventual shared occasion referenced herein above including yet unmentioned individuals aside perhaps Mr Pork Bellies & Mrs Beer Cheese Sandwiches).
