It says the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, and 20 pounds more than a red bird. So we can conclude that it weighs 20 pounds more than the yellow snake. Since the weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds, the weight of the yellow snake would be 50 - 20 = 30. The condition 3 says the container containing these animals weighs 20 pounds. This means the sum of all weights is 30 + 20 = 50. So the overall weight of the container is 50 pounds.
