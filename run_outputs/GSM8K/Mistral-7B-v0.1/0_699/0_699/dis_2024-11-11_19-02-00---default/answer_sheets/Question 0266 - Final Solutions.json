There are two types of fees: a 3% transfer fee and a 5% brokerage fee. Let's start with the transfer fee. We know that Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. To calculate the transfer fee, we multiply the sale price by 3%, so the transfer fee is $400 000 * 3% = $12 000. Next, we have the brokerage fee. To calculate this, we take 5% of the sale price, so the brokerage fee is $400 000 * 5% = $20 000.
