Question: How many hours did Sadie sleep throughout the entire week altogether?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. On monday, Sadie slept for eight hours. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than that. That means she slept 8 - 2 = 6. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more each day. So for the first three days, she slept 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 hours. For the last three days, she slept 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 hours. So she slept 9 + 12 = 21 hours altogether.
