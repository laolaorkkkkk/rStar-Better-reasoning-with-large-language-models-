Condition 2: One zebra has 36 stripes. Condition 3: Another zebra has half as many stripes as this one. Question: What is the average number of stripes for these zebras?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many stripes each of the three zebras have. From condition 1, 2 zebras have 17 each, so that is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes total. From condition 2, one zebra has 36 stripes. Finally, from condition 3, another zebra has half as many stripes as this one, which means it has 1/2 * 36 = 18 stripes. Adding up all the stripes, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. To find the average, we divide the total by the number of zebras (3), which gives us 88 / 3 = 29 stripes per zebra.
