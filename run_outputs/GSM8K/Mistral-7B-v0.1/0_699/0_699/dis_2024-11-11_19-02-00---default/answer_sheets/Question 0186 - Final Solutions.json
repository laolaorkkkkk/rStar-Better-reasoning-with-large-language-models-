The problem states that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Next, we distribute the straw equally among the rats, hamsters, and rabbits based on their numbers. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so 3 x 6 = 18 pieces of straw for the rats.

Finally, there is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.\n\nNow that we know how much straw is used for each group, we can calculate the number of rats in each cage. Since we know the total amount of straw used, the remaining straw can be distributed among the rats.
