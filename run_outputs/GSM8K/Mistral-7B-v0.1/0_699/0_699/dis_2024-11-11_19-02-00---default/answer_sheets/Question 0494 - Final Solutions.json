This means that 10 - 9 = 1 cheerleader is not 64 inches tall. That is the one that is 60 inches tall. To make a pyramid, you need 4 girls on the bottom. Each girl adds 64 inches of height. So 4 * 64 = 256 inches. Then there are 3 girls on the next level up. Each adds another 64 inches. So 3 * 64 = 192 inches. Finally, there are 2 girls above them. They add another 64 inches. So 2 * 64 = 128 inches. Then there is the shortest girl. She adds 60 inches. So the total height of the pyramid will be 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches.
