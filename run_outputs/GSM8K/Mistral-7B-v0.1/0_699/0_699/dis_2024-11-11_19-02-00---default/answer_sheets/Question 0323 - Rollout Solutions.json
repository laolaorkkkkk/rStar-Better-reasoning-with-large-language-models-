To do this, we need to know the temperature of the hot coffee and its volume. Let's assume the hot coffee has a volume of 200 milliliters and a temperature of 100 degrees.

We know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and we want to know how much stronger the coffee becomes after adding 15 milliliters of cream. The strength of the coffee after cooling can be calculated using the formula strength = mass / volume. Since the coffee's volume remains constant at 200 milliliters, the only variable is its mass. We know that 13 milligrams of mass is lost for every degree of cooling, so we can calculate the new mass using the following equation: new mass = old mass - (number of degrees cooled * 13 milligrams).
