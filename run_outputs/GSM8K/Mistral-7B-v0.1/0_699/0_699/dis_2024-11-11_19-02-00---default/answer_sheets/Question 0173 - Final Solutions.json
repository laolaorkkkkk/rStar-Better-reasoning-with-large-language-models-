Jessica needs to make 36 monthly payments. Each payment needs to exceed its minimum by 50%. Let's start with her student loan. Its minimum is $300. So 1.5 times its minimum would be 300 * 1.5 = 450. The same goes for credit card: 1.5 * 200 = 300. And mortgage: 1.5 * 500 = 750. Thus, she owes $450, $300, and $750 for student loan, credit card, and mortgage respectively.
