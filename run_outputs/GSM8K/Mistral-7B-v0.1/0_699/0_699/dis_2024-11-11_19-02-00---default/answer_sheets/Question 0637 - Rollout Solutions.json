According to condition 1, Reggie, Lynn and Paisley run together. So the distance that Paisley ran is the same as the distance that Reggie and Lynn ran. Since Reggie ran 5 times as far as Paisley, Reggie ran 5 times more than Paisley's distance. Adding three miles to that, we get 5 x Paisley's distance plus 3 = Reggie's distance. So if Paisley ran 4 miles, that means Reggie ran 4 + 5(Paisley's distance) + 3 = Reggie's distance. That simplifies to 4 + 5 + Paisley's distance = Reggie's distance.
