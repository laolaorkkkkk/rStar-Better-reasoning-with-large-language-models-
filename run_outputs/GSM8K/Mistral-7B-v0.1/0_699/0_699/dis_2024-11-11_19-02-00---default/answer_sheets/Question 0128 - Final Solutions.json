It's said that watermelons cost three times what peppers cost. The price of peppers can be calculated as follows: the price of a watermelon divided by 3. Let's say that the price of a watermelon is W. W / 3 is the price of peppers. Since oranges cost 5$ less than a watermelon, we can get the price of oranges by subtracting 5 from the price of a watermelon. Let's say that the price of oranges is O. O = W - 5. We are asked how much Dillon will spend. To find this out, we need to calculate the total amount of money required to purchase 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Each watermelon costs W$. As we mentioned earlier, each pepper costs W / 3$, and each orange costs O$. Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon needs to spend is 4 * W + 20 * (W / 3) + 10 * O. Substituting the values for W and O in the above equation, we get: 4 * W + 20 * (W / 3) + 10 * (W - 5). Simplifying the expression further, we get 4W + (20 / 3)W - 10.
