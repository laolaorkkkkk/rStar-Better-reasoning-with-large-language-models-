First, we need to identify variables. In this case, it looks like there are three main variables: time needed to dig the well, amount of soil, amount of clay.

So, time needed to dig the well is (total depth / time to dig through soil) + (total depth / time to dig through clay). That is (32 / 4) + (32 / 2 * 4) = 8 + 16 = 24 hours.
