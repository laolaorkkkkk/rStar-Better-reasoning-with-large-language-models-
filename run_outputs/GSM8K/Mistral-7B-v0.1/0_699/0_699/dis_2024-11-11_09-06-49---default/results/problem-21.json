Thus, if you consider this as well like what happened one year backward than actually happenable time , Raymond's child will still undergo another birth cycle within next month because babies come once every year thus during those remaining few months its considered part way through existing year .

His child was likely not yet even conceived because sperm can survive up to about 5 weeks inside a woman during pregnancy while eggs can live as long as around 24 hours without fertilization (so this question assumes conception happened fairly soon). Thus taking into account these biological facts coupled with our previous calculations, Raynaud's older cousin made him their firstborn no later than approximately halfway through last year since you cannot count fractions like six months or three quarters if counting full calendar time periods i.e., whole numbers only!

Since we know Samantha turns one year younger every time Raymond gets another birthday passed, as soon as Samuel reached 31; this also counts for all other past instances including the same period within which Rewas came into existence. Thus, considering their ages together makes us conclude Ray's Son would thus be just over three decades earlier because these events happened simultaneously across them throughout most of life durations without necessarily following any chronological order or even synchrony during certain periods.
