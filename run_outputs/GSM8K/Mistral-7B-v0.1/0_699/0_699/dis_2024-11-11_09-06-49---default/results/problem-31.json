Yes, because generally speaking the formulae used yield diverging sums unless identical units and interpretations of percentage increases apply universally across both computations \u2013 hence discrepancies arise since individual estimates vary based upon distinctive factors like round-off rules & fractional adjustments impacting numerical integrity during aggregation processes within specified constraints thereby causing variations amongst resultant figures ensuing through employment disparate computation tactics aimed respectively fulfill respective demands delineated separately among involved parties thus generating differentiated outcome outputs attributable principally owing differential conceptual understanding exhibited vis-\u00e0-vis quantification techniques exercised whilst resolving presented challenges specifically targetting evaluation scope tailored",
