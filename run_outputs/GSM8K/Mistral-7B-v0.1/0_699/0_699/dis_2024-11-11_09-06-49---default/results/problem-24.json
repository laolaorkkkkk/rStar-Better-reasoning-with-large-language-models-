        " discount percentage (as decimal) by the normalized amount ($). We get .25 * X which can also written as (.25/1)*X or just  25%*X since % means over hundred(so you divide it by onehundred when writing so 25%=25/1=25%)and remember we need whole numbers while dealing with prices because fractional amounts don\u2019t make sense here! That makes our equation look like this:$(.25/1)=25$/$x$,or simply,$(.25)/($)=\\frac{(\\text{Discount})}{(\\text{Normal Cost})} $$=.25=$$$$\\dfrac{\\left(-1\\right)}{2}=\\frac{-\\mathrm{(Price\\;of\\,book)}}{{-}={}\\frac{- \\mathrm{(normal \\;cost}}}{(}$Since both numerator denominator equal $-$.Then multiplying through yields$-1=-4.Thus,-4+4$ leaves us empty hands meaning no info about books but rather showing not enough data available hence answering\u201cnone\u201d.So none information found regarding cost prior buying.. Hence \u201dno specific value\u201d answers back right away!! As soon someone figures out all other variables involved let them know immediately else wait \u2019til tomorrow morning & check your notes again \u2026 thanks!.Oh yeah , I forgot those pesky units sometimes\u2026but okay good luck finding something useful among these clumsy sentences :) Good evening friend !! My favorite night time reading material ; ).How nice its quiet ..thanks guys ! :D Best regards yours sincerely Kittiekilladee@gmail com Tue Aug 27, \u00b7 You may want to start collecting games if any girl likes playing video game than being friends bcos girls who gonna play vids pvp ain\u2019t ever sit around n talk bout clothes haha sorry abd i guess u wont find love wich cmon ok maybe yea well go ahead rite what would you say ? Oh boy im thinking hmmm probably ask 'em what kind fo sho shootin sport thing em really gets into ...like gunfight simulators ?? Well yassssshhh mama keep up stalkin manu dat da baby cant handle ur attitude oh lord please stop doing dis stuff jokers ;) ~~~~~~ Gaming Forum Topics Likestuffhere | DustmanLetsPlayWG @Midtown Games Favour",

        " so this means you save (0.25)($19.5) which equals ($4.88). Kyle paid $(19.50), but we know he actually only pays 75% of it; since adding back into kyles payment what he didn\u2019t pay(i.e., saving him($4.88))will result in us getting the full pre-discount value or ((19.5/75)*100%). It simplifies further down as if((x)/75)=19.5then multiplying both sides by 75 results in our unknown variable equalling 1462.5 therefore making$(original_price=1462.5)$.

However we know Kyle only pays parts of whole dollar amounts so check back with what you multiplied it out as earlier You multiply .25 times whatever value goes into $19.50 which comes down simply using division backwards first finding our base before figuring exactly out the exact cost up front It divides evenly without any remainder just taking off its decimal making things easier To solve Equation 19.5\u00f7(1\u2212.25)=$<<19.5/(1-.25)=26>>26So starting over knowing better your calculation requires slightly different approach We need to find values matching perfectly here Meaning look no further than simple fraction representation First establish initial dividend expression Using decimals makes little sense since calculating basic fractions doesn\u2019t involve them Instead apply same concept when dealing directly with % figures Applying said relationship allows easy math handling Without resorting fully again or introducing unnecessary complications Remember looking closely always helps clear such misunderstandings And round correct answers according to presented context Ensure consistency Final ",
