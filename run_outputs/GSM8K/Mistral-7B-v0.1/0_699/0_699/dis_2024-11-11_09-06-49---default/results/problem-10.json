Could you please clarify your request so I can assist you accurately regarding this calculation involving percentage errors? To calculate a measurement using significant figures rules while ensuring not to propagate rounding errors too early (which could lead to higher uncertainty), follow these steps considering the rule against cancelation out units before multiplication/division operations begin if possible; otherwise adjust results later based on least precise measure involved during intermediate calculations without prematurely reducing precision due to unit conversion mistakes:",
