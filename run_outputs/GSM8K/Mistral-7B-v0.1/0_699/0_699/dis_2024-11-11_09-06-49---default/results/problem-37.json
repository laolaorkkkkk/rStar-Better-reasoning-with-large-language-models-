        " find out how much one game costs; it\u2019s equal to 20/8 = 2.5$ per set (because the cost price was divided equally).

Here goes my own calculation\u2026 First let me see.. As long time I know you like math problem solving rather than guessing stories around figures presented without contextual clues about pricing etc., maybe better provide explicit solution yourself ?

Therefore, if he used no cash but just the value equivalent of one legos sold we could assume herein our first approximation as only being accurate until about ten sales before any further accuracy can not really improve matters considerably without going well past legal financial regulations when dealing with large values such like millions. However while under consideration let us also observe carefully into account upon calculation what happens next -- i would guess because even though these things might seem pretty close together yet again remember simple mathematics tells you always make sure those numbers remain consistent regardless whether their respective prices change simultaneously otherwise perhaps better approaches exist indeed! Given enough time & practice however neither option sounds right either so lets explore both methods below : One possibility may involve adding slightly less than three decimals place terms per round ; doing something similar yields somewhat acceptable results whereas another way involves subtracting fractions within decimal places repeatedly resulting finally getting closer toward correct amounts eventually arriving precisely exactly matching initial figures provided above therefore showing clearly why careful attention pays importance during every stage throughout calculations process ensuring precision needed successfully completing task efficiently effectively reducing potential errors caused possibly due lack sufficient knowledge necessary skills essential tools required working environment etc...
