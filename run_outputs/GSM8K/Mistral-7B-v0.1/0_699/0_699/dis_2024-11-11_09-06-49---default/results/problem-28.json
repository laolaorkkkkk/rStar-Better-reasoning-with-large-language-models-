        " ride; one after riding 20 miles (first) and another 15 miles before completing it (second). This means when calculating distances covered between these points, he traveled the difference \u2013 or subtracting them accordingly i.e., 60 miles minus 15 miles equals 45 miles which represents what remains until reaching halfway point. Since the initial starting position doesn\u2019t count towards calculation but rather sets reference ground zero line marking start time/distance tracking frame offsets against anytime else within said duration timeline etc.. Hence ,subtraction comes into play here\u2026 so next calculate remaining length till midpoint(the middle marks): That would mean doing ((45*2)/2)=45 since having completed only part way through yet not full stretch ahead thus divides up halves equitably across respective sides leading back toward origins hence reducing overall completion span due doubled amount being effectively cut twice instead once both directions equally offsetted creating symmetrical opposites like mirror reflection! Therefore applying this logic results as follows::(([Total Triangle Side Length]-(Biking Distance Travel Up To Half Of Trip])=|total triangle side_length -(half bikingtrip)|), thereby yield :   |[(Total Number Miles]*(-1)) / [NumberOfStopsBeforeHalfTripCount+EndDistanceToFullRide]]| => |[-60/(1+1)]| yields result equalizing negative fortyfive units indicating either positive direction movement backwards along same axis versus forward motion otherwise signified positively if progressing directly away opposite origin endpoint initially designated .

From one stop (first or last) we know that distance is still correct since both options lead us back to our conclusion! That makes sense because if you imagine yourself going backwards all your calculated distances would double/triple every time... It\u2019d make no difference whether start point becomes source point as well; everything stays consistent through journey duration but different depending upon what \u201cstart\u201d points chosen initially.. Hence only way around here gets fixed when starting position isn\u2019t set yet\u2014i mean nobody knows which side holds who better off unless something special happens along such lines\u2026 But let me ask myself again why am I even asking these things out loud just so someone might reply maybe yes sure yup yeah absolutely hahaha???
