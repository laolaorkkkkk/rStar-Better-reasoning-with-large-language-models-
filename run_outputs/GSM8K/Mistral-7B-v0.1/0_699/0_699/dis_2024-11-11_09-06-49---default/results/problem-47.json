        " John spends (blue) 200/40 = <<200/40=5>>5 times as many blues as red ones; therefore this amount corresponds to half of what was invested into purchasing him all these shirts which equals to doubled value \u2013 namely $$ 2*5*$40=$400. Therefore, if only knowing prices it appears like the right result but because I still don\u2019t know about quantities i need to introduce new variable 'n', n being integer stands for quantity. Thus far our data looks something like this below Table showing Tie Prices Per Unit Quantity Total Cost ($): Blue   $      40      ??    ???     Red         $         60      ??              ???? Equation based off known amounts above : BQ+RQ=total(Tie QTY)=unknown ; BB*(BQ)+BR* RQ=(Total Amount Invested To Buy All The Ties )=>BB.*Q_Blue+(BO)*QRed$=$(200); also equal ((Double)(TB)) => BO*.qred$. This turns out even simpler since my other equations look similar & canceling them both leaves us with just one equation representing costs: BR.$=(DOUBLE($)); thus $(BC*$)...$(double(%...))==&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((DBusiness Expense)$)-({SBusinessExpense}) Since last line represents same values as second row its always true regardless any particular unknown variables involved or real world situations applied here , meaning no further solving needed anymore except plugging actual numbers provided earlier inside formulas resulting with following calculations shown underneath those used symbols table filled up accordingly ...which concludes everything ..So putting initial info back together results in finally answering original questioN ::<|end_of_document|> ",
        " we don't know exactly the amount yet but only can infer it based on price difference mentioned which was about equaling percentages or ratios not quantity so let\u2019s say if B represents number of Blue Tie units (assuming each tie regardless whether blue or red costs similar prices individually) : Number_of Red_Tie_units=B*Certain_factor(which could also imply ratio considering here pricing factor because their actual dollar amounts isn't provided); And Price Difference %=(Price Of One Red Tie / Cost Price Per Unit ) * Certain Factor . Given ,Cost per unit=$40 means our base reference point hence taking Value Units/Red Aspect At ($40),We get Our Base Reference Point; To obtain Correct Results With This Approach We Need Two Values That Can Provide Us Result Based Off Pricing Structure & Quantity Pertinent Ratio i.e one value representing 'How Much More Was Spent?' and Other Representing 'Which color tied Where Did They Waste Money'. Assuming this methodology applies perfectly due lack enough information directly otherwise ; Calculation Is Not Possible Here Because Required Direct Information Absent But Understanding Conditions Lets Propose Something Close To Actual Scenario Which Could Possibly Apply Exact Details Yet Be Closer Simulation Example Hence..

Each tie costs $.4 times less than it would if the price was not higher--this makes them $40*.4=.$16 cheaper per unit ($). To buy one red tie you pay its base (.$.4), plus .5*(.$16)=$(.$8) extra due to increase above normal prices; your grand spending thus totals: $(4)+(4+8)($8+$16=$$.$). Fortunately we don\u2019t need these values directly since their sum matches our original problem statement! We just multiply everything together like so..total expense=prices*(red)*quantityso far...which yields $$)$.

We know that one tie costs him $40 because he spent exactly this amount per color; hence using equation 'Cost_per_tie*quantity=total_cost', we find out that since these represent quantities respectively, x = Cost_blue / Price_per_blue or n_red == x >>  2n equals 2*(Cost/Price) equal to ($200/$40)*2 = Number>>   10 > so John bought twelve red ties too(i.e., Twice as many)!

Half of this would be what percentage increase so just calculate fifty percent of forty which equals twenty additional units making their individual prices sixty dollars apiece plus four hundred (for ten altogether)--that makes six hundred dollars overall outlay according to data supplied. Find actual spending totals adding together results above using formula shown below Total Spent = BlueTicketsCost*BluePrices+RedTicketsCost*[PriceForEach+(PercentIncrease/100)*(PriceOfOneBluetie)]=TotalSpent Formula Substitute real values into our equation & simplify like before We get back original value stated near beginning 'two hundreds': Two Hundred Units Equation Resulting ",

        " Calculate the amount John paid for all green ties (red ties). Multiply quantity (number) times unit price; therefore, it was found that John purchased 5 \u00d7 $40 =$200 worth of blue ties and also purchases another 10\u00d7($60)=$600 worth of red ties since you assumed earlier that he took out 10 pairs rather than stating specifically how many individual items made up these numbers. This comes together when adding both sums so that it\u2019ll show whether or not he spends correctly based off what information we possess.. Thus if everything goes through accurately then this would add up nicely resulting into him paying altogether $\\boxed{800}$. However without knowing exactly how big sets vs single item transactions work here its hard saying otherwise because technically either way could happen depending who owners mind set toward their shopping decisions but hopefully my assumptions worked well enough! Finally note important reminder about using percentages too often might cause mistakes due large differences involved like say increasing prices suddenly instead only minor variations etc., best practice keep track closely always during calculations whenever possible no need worry though really considering current example seems mostly straightforward just follow steps explained above quickly easily see why costs ended matching perfectly finally satisfying criteria fully specified .
