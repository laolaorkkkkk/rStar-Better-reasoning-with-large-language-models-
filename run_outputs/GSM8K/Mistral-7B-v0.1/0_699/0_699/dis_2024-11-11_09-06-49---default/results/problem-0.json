Additionally, she also bakes using another group of eggs; specifically, it mentions \"she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" Therefore, this denotes usage of additional 4 eggs per day beyond what she consumes. This suggests a cumulative consumption amounting to 3(eggs) + 4(muffin preparation) equalling seven (7) eggs consumed/used in totality within one single diurnal cycle as illustrated succinctly below :   Number of Usage Egg Breakfast Muffin Preparation Total Consumption= Three plus Four Equals Seven Let us re-calculate again taking into consideration only those not employed ibid., such quantities being thus represented via mathematical expression indicated hereunder: Quantity Employed Less Requirements Hence Determined Remaining Stock Available to Be Sold At Farmer Markets Price Per Unit Sales Amount=$ Two Seventeen Sixteen minus Seven equals Nine Thus we establish Herewith our solution henceforth stated numerically and subsequently denominated monetarily as follows:: One Dollar Ninety cents ",

Add these numbers together to determine their combined total impact on one day's production. Egg consumption during breakfast plus cookie making equals eleven ((3+4)=7). Subtract this value from the initial quantity produced as those quantities cannot enter into sale since only untouched ones can sell. Initial output minus consumed/baked amounts equalizes back to original count of fifteen remaining sales potential; thus being what gets sold [(16-7=9)].
