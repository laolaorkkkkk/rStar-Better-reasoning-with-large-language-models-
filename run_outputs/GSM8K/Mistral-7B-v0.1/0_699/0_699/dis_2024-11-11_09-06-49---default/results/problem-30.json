        " out what one 'part' or unit represents within this context (i.e., dividing up the combined ages). Since together, these boys add up to 162 , you would simply divide both sides equally based upon your denominator i.e..;  7+11=18 parts which equals 162/18=9 per part meaning all seven sections represent 7*9=63 while eleven stand as 11*9= 99 . You can use this approach if it becomes difficult understanding ratios straight off the bat. To determine Allen\u2019s current age we refer back to our calculations above only finding his share equaling exactly 99(remember when multiplied against its respective factor) because we knew beforehand Allen represented those ten additional factors than darrel so adding another decade yields him being respectively aged at precisely 99+(another dozen)=111years old well into maturity!

Solving all these equations simultaneously results with values resulting 7*(total_age /(7+11)) = Darrell\u2019s present age; hence 7*(162/(7+11)), thus Darrell Present is  7*(162/18), simplifying leads us to get , therefore getting ; likewise similar computations provide Allen current age i.e., y.(or)(Total\\_Age\\ /\\ (\\text{rational}\\ +\\ \\text{denominator}) )i.e.; currently gets him aged ___.
