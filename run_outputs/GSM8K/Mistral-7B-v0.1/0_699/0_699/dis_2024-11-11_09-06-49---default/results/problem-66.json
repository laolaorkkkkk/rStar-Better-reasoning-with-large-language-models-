This would mean overall there were 4*20 which equals to 80 different persons representing sports groups while taking into account teachers who acted as referees during games \u2013 therefore our initial formula simplifies down quite well! However if considering just athletics participants without any supervision duties required or volunteering responsibilities considered...then removing those \u2018extra helpers\u2018 results us having :total count-(numofrefereeses*(bothforwomenandmen),i.e.:totalcount-(4*(4)).
