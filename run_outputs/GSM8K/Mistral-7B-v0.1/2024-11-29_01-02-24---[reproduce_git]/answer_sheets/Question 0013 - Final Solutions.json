Let's start by finding the number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie started with. We know that she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, if we let x be the number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie started with, then a third of x would be the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house. Next, we know that she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners than the ones she sold at the green house to the red house. This means that the number of vacuum cleaners she sold to the red house must be one less than twice the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house. Lastly, we know that she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. Since she sold one less than twice the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house to the red house, she must have sold half of one less than twice the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house to the orange house. Putting all of these together, we can write an equation that describes the situation: Solving for x, we get x = 5, so Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners.
