First, calculate the total price of all items except for pizza. The total cost for the chicken meal, 5 packs of milk, and 4 apples is 12 (chicken meal cost) + ($3 * 5) (packs of milk) + ($1.50 * 4) (apples) = 20 + 15 + 6 = 41. Subtract the total price of all items except for pizza from the total amount paid. The total amount paid was 50. So, the total price of pizza was 50 - 41 = 9. Divide the total price of pizza by its individual price to find out how many boxes of pizza were ordered. The individual price of pizza is 8.50. So, we have 9 / 8.5 = 1.059.
