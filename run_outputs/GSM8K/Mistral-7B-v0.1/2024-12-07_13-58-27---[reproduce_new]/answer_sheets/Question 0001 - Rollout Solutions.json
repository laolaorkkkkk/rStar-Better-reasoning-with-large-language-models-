The question says that each robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half as much white fiber. Let's represent that as an equation. 2b + h/2 = 2b. Since b represents blue, let's change it to r for robe. So now it is 2r + h/2 = 2r. Notice that if you solve this equation for r, you get 2r = h/2. That means that for any value of h, r will be equal to h/2. In other words, no matter how much white fiber is required per robe, the same amount of blue fiber is always needed, which is half as much as the white.
