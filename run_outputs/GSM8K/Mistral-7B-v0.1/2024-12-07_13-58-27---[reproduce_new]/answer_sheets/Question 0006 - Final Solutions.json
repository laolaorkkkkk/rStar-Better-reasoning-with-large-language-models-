We need to calculate how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. We can start with the number of sheep in Toulouse. Let's call it T. We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. That means Toulouse's number of sheep multiplied by 2 is Charleston's number of sheep. We can write this as 2 \u00d7 T = C. We also know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. That means Charleston's number of sheep multiplied by 4 is Seattle's number of sheep. We can write this as 4 \u00d7 C = S. Now we want to find the total number of sheep. This is just the sum of the numbers of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. We can write this as T + C + S. Substituting our earlier values for T, C, and S gives us the following equation: T + C + S = T + 2 \u00d7 T + 4 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 T) + 20 = 2 \u00d7 T + 2 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 T) + 4 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 T) + 20 = 4 \u00d7 T + 4 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 T) + 4 \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 T) + 20 = 12 \u00d7 T + 20 = T + 20.

Let's call the number of sheep Toulouse has X. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can write an equation: 2 * X = Y, where Y is the number of sheep Charleston has. We already know that Y = 4 * Z, where Z is the number of sheep Seattle has. Therefore, 2 * X = 4 * Z. Solving for X, we get: X = Z * 4 / 2 = 2Z. Since we also know that Z = 20, we have: X = 20 * 4 / 2 = 40.\n\nSince we also know that X + Y + Z = 30, we can substitute X = 40 into this equation: 40 + Y + Z = 30.
