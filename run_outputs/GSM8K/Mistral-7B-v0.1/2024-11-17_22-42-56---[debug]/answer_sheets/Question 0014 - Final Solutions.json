Question: What percentage of the entire students in this class opted for hip-hop dance?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine the total number of students in the dance class by adding up the numbers from the conditions. In condition 1, it says that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. There are 20 students in total. So, 20 * 20% = 4 students. In condition 2, it says that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. So, we need to subtract 4 students from the 20 students. This leaves us with 16 students. 16 * 25% = 4 students. So, the total number of students in the dance class is 4 + 4 = 8 students."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's determine the total number of students in the dance class. From the conditions we know that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. There are 20 students in total. So 20 * 20% = 4 students. Next, we know that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. So we need to subtract 4 students from the 20 students. This leaves us with 16 students. 16 * 25% = 4 students. So the total number of students in the dance class is 4 + 4 = 8 students. Now that we know the total number of students, we can answer the question. We know that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance. That means there were 4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance. 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. That means there were 4 students who enrolled in jazz dance. The rest of the students (8 - 4 = 4) enrolled in hip-hop dance. So 4 / 8 * 100% = 50%. The answer is: 50%.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
