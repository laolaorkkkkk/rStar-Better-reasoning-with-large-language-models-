Tim lives 2 miles from school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. This means it would take 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 7 minutes and 46 seconds for Tim to reach home without a race. Now we know how long it takes Tim to reach home on his own, let's calculate how long it would take Steve to reach home if he were biking at full speed. For this, we need to divide the distance Steve must travel by his speed. Steve lives 3 miles from school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. This means it would take 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 6 minutes and 46 seconds for Steve to reach home at full speed. Since Steve and Tim have started racing each other, the one who reaches home first will stop until the other person arrives. Thus, the answer to our question is the difference between these two times: 7 minutes and 46 seconds - 6 minutes and 46 seconds = 1 minute and 1 second.

We need to figure out how far Steve would have to go to determine the winner. The problem gives us information about him riding his bike. Since we want to find out if Tim beat him or not, we also need to know how fast Tim rides his skateboard. Let's figure it out. The problem tells us that Steve lives 3 miles from the school. This means that Steve has to cover this distance before reaching home. Let's convert the distance to feet. The number of feet is 3 miles * 5280 feet/miles = 15,840 feet. The problem also tells us that Steve rides his bike at 440 feet/minute. To find out how many seconds it takes him to travel 15,840 feet, let's divide the distance by his speed: 15,840 / 440 = 35.676 minutes.

The problem states that he lives 2 miles from the school and can travel at 264 feet/minute. The problem asks us to convert the distance to feet. We do so: 2 miles * 5280 feet/miles = 10,560 feet. Converting the speed to feet/seconds: 264 feet/minute * (1 second/60 seconds) = 4.4 feet/second. Similar to the calculation for Steve, let's find out how long it will take Tim to travel 10,560 feet: 10,560 / 4.4 = 2409.1 seconds. As you can see, 2409.1 seconds > 2140.2 seconds, meaning Tim wins!

We have information about Steve and Tim. Steve lives 3 miles away, and Tim lives 2 miles away. Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute.
