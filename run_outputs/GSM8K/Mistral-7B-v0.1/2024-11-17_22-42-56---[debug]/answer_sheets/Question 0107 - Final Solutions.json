Each episode on Monday and Tuesday was 1 hour long, so he watched 2 hours (1 hour x 2 days). In minutes, this is 2 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes. Then we need to calculate how many minutes Frankie watched on Wednesday. He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, so let's assume he watched 3 episodes. This is 3 episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 90 minutes. Next, we need to calculate how many minutes Frankie watched on Thursday. He watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. The 1-hour episode is 1 hour x 60 minutes per hour = 60 minutes, and the 30-minute show is 1 episode x 30 minutes per episode = 30 minutes.
