To convert calories to grams, we need to divide the number of calories by the number of calories per gram. Since one serving of a bag of chips contains 250 calories and there are 4 calories per gram, we can calculate the number of grams in one serving as follows: 250 / 4 = 62.5 grams.", "2": "Multiply the number of grams in one serving by the number of servings in the bag. We know that the bag holds 5 servings, so the total number of grams in the bag is calculated as follows: 5 x 62.5 = 312.5 grams.", "3": "Compare the total number of grams in the bag with the remaining calories available for the day. Since our daily calorie target is 2000 and we have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories available for the day are 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. We need to convert these calories to grams using the same method as above, which gives us 50 grams."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. One serving of a bag of chips contains 250 calories. The bag holds 5 servings. So the entire bag of chips contains 250 * 5 = 1250 calories. Our daily calorie target is 2000, and we have already consumed 1800 calories. So we have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left. We can convert those calories into grams by dividing them by 4 (since 1 gram contains 4 calories). 200 / 4 = 50. So we can safely consume up to 50 grams of chips from this bag while staying within our calorie limit.
