According to the problem, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has first. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has (Cindy's number of pets) + 2 = Cindy's number of pets + 2. We know Cindy has four pets, so Marcia has four + 2 = 6 pets. Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has three times six = 18 pets. Since we now know the number of pets Jan has, we can calculate the number of pets Cindy has. According to the problem, Cindy has two fewer pets than Marcia. We also know Marcia has six pets, so Cindy has (Marcia's number of pets) - 2 = Marcia's number of pets - 2. We know Marcia has six pets, so Cindy has six - 2 = 4 pets. We now know the number of pets Jan and Cindy have. To find the total number of pets the three have, we add their number of pets together: 18 (number of pets Jan has) + 4 (number of pets Cindy has) + 6 (number of pets Marcia has) = 32.
