That means she gets 20 dollars per hour for teaching and 30 dollars per hour for coaching. In 50 weeks, she worked 50 * 35 = 1750 hours as a teacher. At 20 dollars per hour, that is 20 * 1750 = 35000 dollars. As a coach, she worked 50 * 15 = 750 hours. At 30 dollars per hour, that is 30 * 750 = 22500 dollars.
