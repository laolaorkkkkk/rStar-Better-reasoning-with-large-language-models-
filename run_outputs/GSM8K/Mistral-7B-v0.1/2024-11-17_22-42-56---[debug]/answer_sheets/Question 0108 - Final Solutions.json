We want to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year. Condition 1 tells us that 110 cookies were finished and cooling after Henry\u2019s baking session. Condition 2 says that he wanted to make twice as many as last year. So if we let n be the number of cookies he baked last year, then 110 = 2n.
