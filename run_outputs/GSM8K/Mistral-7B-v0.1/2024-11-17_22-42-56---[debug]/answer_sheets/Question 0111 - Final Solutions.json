The third condition is that it takes her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The fourth condition is that the shore is sixty-four seconds away. To answer the question, we need to know how many liters of water the boat takes on before reaching the shore. We can find this by multiplying the rate of water intake (two liters per ten feet) by the distance travelled (sixty-four feet). This means the boat takes on eight liters of water before reaching the shore.
