Firstly, let's count the total number of toys in the room. There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. So, there are 5+3+1=9 toys in the room. Secondly, we need to calculate the cost of each toy. Each red car costs $4, each action figure costs $5, and the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Thus, it also costs $5*3=$15. We can multiply the cost of each toy by the number of each type of toy to find out how much each type of toy costs. 5 * 4 = 20 for the cost of red cars, 3 * 5 = 15 for the cost of action figures, and 1 * 15 = 15 for the cost of the doll. Finally, we add up the costs of all the toys to find out how much they are worth. 20 + 15 + 15 = 50. Therefore, all toys are worth $50.
