Remember we need also subtract the fixed dollar figures allocated as well\u2014i.e., $200 towards one child and another $700 toward another dependent which totals them equaling $900. Combine the calculated sums together so you can get exactly why $3500+900=$4400 needs subtraction into it.

From what was calculated above `('(3400)`), it leaves Zaid `('$2600)`.
