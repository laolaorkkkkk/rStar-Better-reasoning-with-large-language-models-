Because this question asks about Allens present age we multiply one unit value or 'part', meaning ten times eleven because his individual share equates to twenty fourteen shares. Hence, when it comes down to figuring out what Alen was 10 years ago , subtracting Ten Years makes him currently forty Four since Twenty-Four minus ten amounts to twelve sixteen eighty plus thirty Two Eighties Add Up To Forty Nine Thirty Three Decades Older From Eleven And That Means Than Today At FIFTY SEVEN YEARS .
