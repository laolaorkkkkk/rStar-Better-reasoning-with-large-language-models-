Since all potatoes require this process before being chopped, we multiply 60 potatoes times 90 seconds per potato resulting in 5400 seconds spent just peeling the potatoes. To convert those minutes into hours, you would divide them evenly amongst twelve (minutes make one hour), getting twenty four thirty second intervals throughout every single hour; meaning six hundred sixty three additional potential working periods exist within these first forty eight mins when taking account both full moments as well as remaining fractions of others. This means Bob could prepare anywhere around or less than seventy seven percent if doing nothing else during work session aside form cleaning said fruit!

Calculate the required duration based upon these factors over all potatoes. Multiply this combined process time across every individual unit quantity(potato) under analysis: Total processing span becomes equal to Single operation cycle Time \u00d7 Potato Quantity Thus, solving the equation proceeds thus: Substituting figures into formula, calculated value equates to : Duration needed amounts around ((95 secs/cycle)*60 cycles) resulting in precisely , rounded downwards owing strictly following convention laid out herein concerning minutes being whole integers while fractions translate onto latter fractional segments denoting remaining parts o",

Therefore; $$(11700\\text{ sec}/3600\\dfrac{\\text {sec}}{\\text{hr}})\\approx$$ $$\\boxed{3.25 \\text { hr}}\\enspace.$$ The above steps yield an approximate solution since while calculating exactly divisible numbers may not result in identical values when compared against fractional approximations ,this approach provides reasonable estimates under practical circumstances .
