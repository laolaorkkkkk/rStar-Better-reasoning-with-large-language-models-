Thus conclusion remains same : Steve won because even though both rode according specified speeds within known distances one doesn't influence another unrelated aspect (like individual performance capacity). But since winning wasn't requested explicitly but wait times post race completion i believe below explanation holds good ; Based off average jogging pace mentioned earlier let`s calculate respective arrival timings considering only physical parameters involved no factors such environmental conditions etc affecting actual run results till date accounted yet due uncertainty these cannot contribute toward present scenario analysis either way..

Similarly calculate the riding duration required for Tim using similar logic but alter only Distance as halfway here i.e.; One less mile implies Total covered length Delta_T=(Distance)*(Delta V) .

We know that one mile contains roughly 5280 feet; since Tim only needs to go across part of a mile twice as far but runs slower due to lacking higher speeds compared to walking uphill while carrying things like backpack etc., therefore you could say overall shorter times involved here just because running faster usually compensates those slightly negative factors such having additional weight during your run!

Next let\u2019s calculate the amount of time it took Timmy if riding his scooter over those same distances. Since tim travelled half as far but twice as slow when compared to steves journey , its expected to take him almost double or exactly **0.01x2=~~0.02~~minutes longer/mins** hence about ***about(max)~0.02\u20130.01=0.01~minutes longer*** /mins assuming no stops along way etc.. Thus both seem like good times unless someone wants greater accuracy; therefore :::Winner ::Tim !!Waiting Time At Hose Until Race Finish=(Tim Winner+ Stevs Loser)=totalTimeforAllToCatchUpForWhoLessDistanceAndVeryFastSpeedWhenTheyHaveAlreadyBeenGivenAnAllowanceOnA BikeBecauseOfHisGreaterDepartureFromSchool ;thisLastEquationIsEasilySolvedUsingArithmeticOrBasicMultiplicationThenSimplerThanNavigatingWithoutComputerPowerAssistanceNowWhileStillUnderstandingThatInOrderToStringConvertDegreesRadiansOneMustDivideByPiTimesTwoFirstButThisOnlyMattersSeparatelyHowManySecondsWillTevinWaitAtHomeBeforeCarolineStartsByCountingEachSecondSinceSheLeftAfterCalculatingHerDestinationAccordingToPreviousInfoWeCanImproveResultsApproximationsPossibilitiesIncludeRoundingOffNumberValuesUsedTakenSoTotalMinusTargetValueProvidedShouldEqualZeroMathWorkBookExplanationsBelowCommitmentCouldTakeSomeResearchCommitsAsWellHoweverYouMayFindItHelpfulHere Or Just FollowRecipe",
        " Tim lives 2 miles away from the school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. Use similar calculations as above; convert the distance into feet (since 1 mile = 5,280 feet). Therefore, Tim needs to travel about 2*5280=10560 feet. Dividing these by Tim\u2019s rate gets us about 40.13 min rounded up to almost exactly 41 mins. Since Steve finished immediately while travelling back to his house when compared against Tim finishing around halfway through his trip(about 20mts), Stephan would still win even if everyone took turns getting home because both runners start simultaneously. Consequently, no amount less/more than zero could possibly make either participant wait any longer once one arrives safely within proximity to own residences post competitive conclusion via mode conveyance efficiencies utilized during said endeavors .

        " distance by the speed. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, Tim's traveling distance would be (2 miles) times (5280 ft/mile), resulting in  10,560 feet traveled to reach Tim\u2019s house. Dividing this resultant value over his average speed yields about .900 pounds mass multiplied by g (. This results into around approx ~~a gravity force of less weight~~ nearly zero compared with steel weights like those used within scientific research laboratories due partly because air resistance reduces effectiveness slightly but still creates impressive demonstrations nonetheless since even though small objects may seem insignificant when discuss large structures such as buildings & bridges! Thus if someone wanted perform physics experiment involving heavy rocks being lifted directly up without taking assistance via pulleys etc., something heavier could potentially suffice instead requiring additional materials besides just stones alone; examples include boulders found underground near streams rivers nearby local quarries generally speaking...... [For comparison purpose], however considering practical terms only consider everyday items easily obtained elsewhere namely ones commonly available anywhere typically not specialized stores specifically geared towards industrial applications whatsoever hence generalizing things accordingly therefore most likely easier approach here regarding common household tools although having larger range sizes might require custom designs respectively depending upon specific project requirements required particularly concerning unique features desired beyond simple lifting needs perhaps related primarily through strengthening structural elements thereby adding extra dimension subsequently leading various challenges encountered among potential limitations present thus far lacking essential information relevant especially during design phase prior testing stages including development itself regardless whether successful completion ultimately achieved solely based physical laws governing matter existence otherwise known universally called thermodynamics principals applied across multiple domains throughout history both academically theoretical physicist level education institutions teach students apply principles taught early foundation courses using experimental methods while working independently solving complex problems faced daily whenever constructing anything new irrespective size scope complexity depth necessary knowledge learned thoroughly sufficient experience gained practicing theory reinforced hands\u2010on learning helping create professional engineer career paths pursued ambitiously worldwide enjoying life wholeheartedly despite occasional setbacks always striving forward continually improving ourselves never forget humility important aspect personal growth vital humanity progression continued progress made possible thanks hard work dedication passion determination inspiring others along journey toward success accomplish great feats overcome adversities together building stronger communities benefiting entire planet earth better understanding nature interconnected systems critical importance"
