It helps ensure everyone receives minimum guaranteed lifetime payments equal amount regardless when someone starts collecting them outta savings because even poorer paid jobs could yield better returns otherwise thanks less bills month prior vs past few months annually combined! Hence why having multiple streams financial flows coming both before & afterwards proves necessary here especially considering differennt tax breaks applied towards investment plans versus those directly fundng future retired self during predominant portion job duration hence lower net costs overall thus improving quality life ahead despite limited cash flow presently available since fewer goods being purchased reduces spending power immediately following departure scenario subsequently increasing household budget allocations posthumously via reduction overhead expenses such insurance policies covering death related contingencies alongwith other typical living requirements including healthcare options vital medical supplies etc...
