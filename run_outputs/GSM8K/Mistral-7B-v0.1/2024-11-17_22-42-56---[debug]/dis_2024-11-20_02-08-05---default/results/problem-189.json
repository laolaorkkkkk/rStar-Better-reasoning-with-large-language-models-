Next ,the price they spend on food was ($20.25-$4.5) or $(15.75)/3\u2248$5.25;so combined their food expenditure worked out about $5.25*3=$15.75 .

Thus both equations lead us back to our original result --that the cost was going to equally share amongst three students--so any difference made no impact on overall solution!

As each attraction charged differently, let\u2019s see if these individual expenses add up properly before splitting the cost: Everyone spends $x while going to both attractions; hence,$(x+x)=$(33*2=$66.)

        " went on 2 different rides costing $33 each, it amounts to $33 x 2 = $66. The amount spent on food was $6.75 (ticket price) - $4.50 (the extra spendings). It comes out as $2.25. All together, the three expenses came up to $20.25 (tickets) + $6.75 (food one time) + $2.25 (food second instance) + $66 (rides) = $95. Splitting this evenly among the 3 friends would mean each friend pays $95 / 3 = $31.67 approximately. Note however we rounded off numbers during calculation; exact splitting requires considering cents too but generally around such value if divided equally could work well enough without needing advanced handling/accuracy. Therefore depending upon preference either precise calculations keeping track every cent can lead towards specific dollar figure or roundish figures like those presented above may suffice when quick assessments needed especially avoiding complex fractions while doing mental arithmetic related daily tasks including shopping budget planning scenarios etc..
