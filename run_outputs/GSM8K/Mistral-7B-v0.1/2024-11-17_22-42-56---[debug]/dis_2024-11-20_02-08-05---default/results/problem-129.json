        " day / 60 = 200 hours daily seeing their patients. Thus, the medical cost would therefore add up to (medical costs) $150/hour*(daily_hours)*(number_of_days)=$150*200*x=($150)(total time spent treating patients). Similarly, we can calculate what this spending means over one month ($9000x), three months ($27000x)$or a year (. )($9000x)/365=$24.66+$yearly expenditure ). This amount adds up quicker as you increase \u201cthe length\u201d of your calculation, because not only are fewer patients being treated individually but also less staff available due to sickness or vacation leave . But let us first find out if any profits exist before considering potential changes like reducing salaries , selling products etc .. Since hospitals don \u2019t directly sell anything during treatment sessions its easy enough just subtract away those totals until eventually ending up with zero..

To calculate $(pd)$, we divide the daily hours worked into portions based on rates charged as shown below: Doctors\u2019 fees:(paid)(patients)poundspounds=$($ppt+$exemount+overhead cost)+profit=(total paycheck earned\u2014all other expenses paid back home).

Therefore every doctor makes $(differenc) based only off payments as well . That would mean ($625-$x)/hour , or because x represents what comes out of pocket since insurance covers part ; hence ((1-(cost_of_insurance_ratio))) times earnings due so let\u2019s say the cost ratio here was 'r'. Thus; [Earnings]=-[doctor fee]*[(percentage covered)]+ [(paid amount)]; E=$-625*(1-.r)+$(taken away); Simplifying yields $$=[earnin]+[$diff taken]; Since r\u22480% earned income equaled $.
