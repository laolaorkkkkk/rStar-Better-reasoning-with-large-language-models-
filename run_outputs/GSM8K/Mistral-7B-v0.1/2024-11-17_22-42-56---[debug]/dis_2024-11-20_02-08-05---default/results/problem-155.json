Lastly, consider the breadth i.e., Baguettes which come out to be 60ft when laid end to end as stated in question itself. Adding up these lengths we get Length of Roll + Croissant+ Baquets => 100 ft + 60 ft + 60 ft =<<100+60+60=220>>220 feet. Thus 'their sum equals.'

Lastly we need to determine the length if you put together three different items using their weight conversions. To convert this task it can only involve converting our already defined lengths here but not adding anything else just yet because no additional weights provided so simply add up those calculated numbers i.e., Roll Length : Baguette:Croissant TotalLength=TotalWeight+Roll_L+=Baguette*2+CroissanatWater*.

Adding them together gets us 1200+720+1440=3360 inches for everything combined. To convert this into feet, since one foot equates to twelve inches, divide your resultant value i.e.,  3360/12 which yields you the correct answer as approximately 280 feet. Thus, if Bill lines up all those bread items end to end, they would stretch out across about 280 feet!
