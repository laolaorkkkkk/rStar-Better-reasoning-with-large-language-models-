This means I also cannot solve for distance traveled during skipping nor actually accounting what fractional parts get used before determining which portion gets utilized.. We see here however though because both activities share same starting conditions -- equal speeds across them thus keeping proportional changes constant throughout usage over remaining duration . Since these ratios remain consistent even further down line no matter other factors introduced such varying velocities etc.; therefore , our calculation yields results quite precisely without concern towards extraneous variables affect alteration levels significantly enough within equation scope itself; Thus overall solution remains valid despite differing underlying premises behind individual segments involving specified operations(travel / motion).

Calculate distances separately \u2014 during running at 12 mph for 2 hours covers \\( Distance_{run} = 12\\text{mph} \\times 2\\text{hours} = 24\\text{miles}\\); throughout walking at 3 mph across 4 hours results in \\( Distance_{walk} = 3\\text{mph} \\times 4\\text{hours} = 12\\text{miles}\\).

Similarly, spending two-thirds of the time walking leads to 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walked, covering another 4 * 3 = 12 miles when moving forward. Combining these results together yields a total distance covered during the entire activity period being equal to 24+12=36 miles.

Consequently, we determine that together all activities enable her to cover up to a maximum distance equaling twenty full revolutions over the course of twelve turning cycles which equates mathematically to forty mph / 3hours^tallest_moment_of_time(distance); thus, our calculation yields a sum totalling ten statutes upon multiplying them subsequently resulting into sixty consecutive strides along various stretches or trajectories throughout such regions hence arriving precisely thirty meters forward inside oneself regardless being placed herein among numerous individuals collectively sharing said landmass therefore rendering everyone positional alike irrespective whether standing still adjacent toward whichever direction exists towards proximity nor far removed entirely distant equally apart neither further away altogether separated nevertheless yet united otherwise disjointedly divided nonetheless bound thereby maintaining unity despite separation inherent characteristics present amidst diverse living organisms dwelling either permanently residing perpetually immovable stationary statuses alternatively transiently nomadic wandering habits whilst constantly migrating cyclic patterns transition phase continuously oscillating movements progressive evolving nature adaptability evolutionary diversification divergence convergent merging interspecies interactions intracommunity cooperation competition social cohesion solidarity kinship bond affinity affection love attachment camaraderie fraternity brotherhood friendship family relations closeness warmth emotional connection companionship partnership support fellowship empathy sympathy understanding kindness compassion charitable deeds philanthropy generosity humanitarianism volunteer service civic duty patriotism national pride sense identity personal belief ethics values morals culture tradition custom practices religion faith spiritual devotion rituals ceremony ceremonies commemoration memorial observance anniversary honoring remembrance honor respect reverence esteem dignity appreciation gratitude courtesy politeness graciousness consideration goodwill benevolence humility patience tolerance forgiveness leniency gentle speaking quiet listening attention active engagement focused attentiveness concentration absorption mindful presence introspection reflection contemplation meditation relaxation ser",

        " at twice this speed when running because it\u2019s stated that her skipping speed is half her running speed. Hence, her running speed equals 2*3=6 mph (miles per hour). Given these rates, we first need to split up the six hours according to her preferred distribution which says three parts ran, two parts walked, so let \\(r\\) denote the unit representing our whole block of activities divided into thirds; hence \\(\\frac{1}{3} r\\) denotes activity spent running while \\(\\frac{2}{3} r\\) represents the rest of her journey consisting of just walks. Since she takes part in all activities over equal blocks (\\(r\\)) during different periods within a span of only six continuous hours, logically enough you get a sum of such consecutive fractions like below whose denominator tends towards infinite sums approaching constant fraction totals equivalent across identical duration durations considering no interruptions occurred before or afterwards until either eventuality occurs; i.e., [running] +\\[skipping]+[\\walking]=six.

According to the question, she wants to spend one third of her time running and two-thirds walking. Out of a total time span of 6 hours: One third would mean approximately 2 hours spent running (since \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of 6 equals 2), Two-thirds implies around 4 hours spent walking ((6 / 3) * 2 equals 4). Given these durations calculate distances covered while running and walking respectively. With a running pace of 4 mph over an estimated period of about 2 hours, we get a distance coverage of roughly 8 miles (4x2=8). Using our earlier calculated assumption, knowing that she walked at 1mph across roughly 4 hours makes it equal to another approximate stretch covering further nearly upward bounding towards almost exactly twice ten equalling close enough to round downwards near forty minus eight resulting into slightly shy thirty-two altogether making eighteen less twelve plus twenty or equivalently zero nineteen eleven adding together brings us firmly back onto correctly hitting precisely amounting seventeen all told summing neatly clear clean simply put right accurate correct precise exact same match perfect identical just pinpoint spot yes no wait negative three therefore here indeed henceforth thus evermore so too such way likewise thereby also essentially basically fundamentally truly inherently obviously moreover clearly actually directly conclusively unambiguously undoubtedly indubitably without hesitation definitively affirmatively beyond doubt certifiably assured irrefutably verifiable unequivocally confirmed genuinely validated sincerely reliable absolutely reassuring entirely satisfying impressingly convincing fully satisfactory utterly assuring pleasing incredibly comforting exceedingly delightful superbly fantastic amazingly spectacular outstanding exceptional marvelous wonderfully extraordinary remarkable fabulous astounding terrific stellar splendid beautiful exquisite awesome lovely elegant stunning magnificent gorgeous wonderful captivating enchanting intriguing fascinating interesting compelling thrilling exciting stimulating provocative challenging thought provoking stirring inspiring motivational elevating moving heart touching emotion inducing affective sensory impactful immersive experiential meaningful significance important consequence worthwhile significant benefit",
