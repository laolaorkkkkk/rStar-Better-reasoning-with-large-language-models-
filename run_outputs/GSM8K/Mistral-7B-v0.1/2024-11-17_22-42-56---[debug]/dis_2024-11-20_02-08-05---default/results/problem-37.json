This situation implies that since he ended up having only $5, he initially didn't possess any other funds besides those obtained from legos sale; hence none went missing due solely to purchasing videogames.

Subtracting these expenses(video game purchase)from original amount made through sale : 195 minus 160= 35 , implies he didn\u2019t earn enough via sales nor spent too much overall; only remaining sum matches our expected outcome perfectly thus concluding this task without further adjustments needed!
