        " second runs it down to 57 seconds (since only three full laps need improvement), third improves another 3 and completes in 54 seconds per lap which totals  216 when multiplied out over all legs together since we round down any fractional part as running times cannot include fractions beyond what actually occurs during performance). Similarly, fourth man would improve himself yet again thus ending up finishing his last section within exactly halfway through fifth setlap(so effectively making him equal to sixth person) so finally taking almost exact average overall score calculated below but note due use of above mentioned logic resulting into slight alterations , hence : ((60+57+54)*2)/4=<<((60+(57+54))*2)/4>>=(189/4)= <<189/4=47.25>>. Thus being fastest possible scenario under conditions stated earlier .
