We want this ratio as close to zero as possible because buying only once doesn\u2019t qualify us for any bulk purchase discount. Thus, our objective function can written out clearly using variables such that P represents 'Total payment', V stands for 'Volume rate per item', F refers 'Fixed charge'.
