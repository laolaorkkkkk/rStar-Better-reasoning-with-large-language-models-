Add up eleven because Jimbo needs just over twin quantities. Thus twelve (plus one extra cashier or bill). Hence your solution appears beneath; Jimmy owns Twelve Dollar bills (USD)$12$.

        " we need to calculate double this amount (twice). Twice means multiply by 2; therefore, it would mean multiplying 8*2 which equals 16$ . According to our last piece of information provided in the question, identify what happens next : We can see that 'Jimmy has \"$X\"', meaning he doesn\u2019t yet know exactly X dollar value ($), but rather its representation as '$'. Next, remembering again that before doubling their amounts, both friends start out equal financially ; however , Jimmy also possesses another \"+2\". This tells us if we get ethel\u2019s second amount plus 2$, Jiambo gets enough funds. Therefore adding these values together yields  \u21d2Ethel+Extra=\"+$2.\"==\"$10.$ To make sure things align accordingly, subtract initial fundings(the ones mentioned) from current state figures or simply observe existing relationships already established within presented statement phrases. Our calculation above confirms such congruence!
