We know one dozen contains 12 items; so divide this figure by 12 to find out how many dozens are present daily i.e.,  1764 / 12 which equates to approximately 147 dozen eggs every day. Since each dozen costs $2, multiply 147 by$2/dozen , resulting in about 294 $. Thus, multiplied across all seven days in a week you would calculate as follows :   294 ($ earned )x 7 (= weeks), producing $2058 (. . ). Hence rounding off upwards we can estimate that over time without considering price hikes or any other factor contributing negatively towards earnings,he could expect sales close nearer around $2162 based upon similar assumptions using rounded numbers instead of exact ones during calculation due to practical considerations like fractional parts not applicable when dealing tangible goods such these herein discussed examples involving whole units only ..
