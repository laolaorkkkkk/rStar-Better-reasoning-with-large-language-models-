        " gallon which equates to ($3.00/gallon)*.2=$.6/gallon. Multiply $.6*10 (number of gallons purchased)=$6. Since it cost them $30 but only spent $24 because of coupons; therefore subtracting what was paid out puts us back into our base price before adding .coupons or taxes like: ((($30-$6)/$3)*100). Which comes together to make: $<<3=(5)(3)>>(total original amount invested)-((6*(3))-(60)))/(original investment*)), resulting finally in percentage return as follows:\"Total Original Amount Invested\"=$60 \"$Return on Investment:$= 24%\". Hence here below would be your correct option among those presented.\r",
        " gallons get .20c every time so multiply .20*10=2 This means we earn back $2 during our trip (and don\u2019t pay it). We spent $30 while also getting $2 back. That equals $30-$2=$28 saved overall as compared to other stations without loyalty points or bonuses. As well know when dealing with fuel calculations use liters instead since one cubic meter contains approximately ten thousand liters making easy conversions especially helpful here because most countries calculate prices based off these amounts rather than imperial units like what Americans traditionally utilize thus saving us further headache downline converting those volumes using both systems simultaneously would only complicate matters unnecessarily hence why such tools exist specifically designed expressing everything exclusively within standard international measures resulting simplifying said processes greatly ultimately benefiting consumer choice allowing them freedom shopping across various platforms worldwide thereby reducing economic barriers previously associated purchasing energy resources particularly fossil fuels often priced according unto location plus availability therefore decreasing dependence solely upon domestic sources increasing competition driving manufacturers toward environment friendly practices consequently enhancing industry standards globally promoting cleaner alternatives whilst improving air quality via emission reduction efforts leading finally towards global sustainability goals achieved collectively through collaboration among stakeholders alike fostering partnerships aimed growing responsible supply chain management methods amongst corporations operating internationally serving diverse customer bases everywhere creating mutually advantageous relationships all contributing positively effect change required bring about desired results essential building stronger communities able reach greater heights together accomplish great things no matter size scale used implementing effective strategies working hard dedicate ourselves daily ensuring success remains attainable regardless circumstance personal life events outside control influence ability achieve intended objectives whatever situation may present challenges overcome hurdles persist despite setback obstacles trials errors learning experiences valuable growth opportunity presented facing adversity always remember persistence pays dividends investments take risks paid forward yields future returns potential unlocked hidden treasures discovered fortune found prosperous outcomes realized fulfillment satisfaction happiness complete journey undertaken beginning steps necessary taking action initiated progress made continued momentum generated moving ahead closer resolution reached closing chapter begun new adventure waiting arrival eager anticipation welcoming unknown possibilities unfolding excitement sparkling joy illuminating path revealed light guiding way home finding answers sought truth embraced fully heart opened mind open accepting destiny calling courage empower self belief trust own capabilities believe impossible dream possible turn vision into reality manifest power hold",
        " amount of .20 worth of reward earned as well; ten times one dollar twenty is $2. Lose all gains equaling [$30-$2=$28]. Their gas would cost them just over $28 when considering the payout/reward points received during purchase. ",
        " $0.20/gallon) = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. They would spend $28 after receiving the reward points or gift cards back as part payment which can later used towards future purchases over time without spending another penny outright hence getting free fuel worthwhile while keeping your wallet full . However considering immediate discounts only since all these things happen based upon loyalty programs etc but still it looks like very smart choice especially when every extra dollar means saving almost twice than what regular pricing implies making sure not just savings goes unnoticed here :) ",
        " spend $\\textbf{Twenty eight} \\text { dollars}$ once all your reward points & coupons applied correctly! It\u2019s time to go back home!!! Keep it going!. Great job!! This question set tests basic math skills involving addition, subtraction or multiplication as well as understanding scenarios related to calculating discounts or gains within real world examples such as shopping/grocery store calculations etc.. All those who passed can move forward till next session starting Monday morning(Tue). Best wishes ahead .. keep practicing... :D"
