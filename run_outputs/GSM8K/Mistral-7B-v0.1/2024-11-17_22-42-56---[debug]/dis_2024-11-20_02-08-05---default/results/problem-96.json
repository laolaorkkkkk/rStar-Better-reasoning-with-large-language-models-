Setting SMART Goals Set Specific Objectives tied directly to achieving personal development goals within defined parameters\u2014short term ones aligned closely with immediate gratification provided by play sessions followed possibly later by longer-term objectives centered around skill advancement reflecting deep engagement levels potentially leading towards competitive platforms thereby instilling further drive & focus hence elevating not just mood but ultimately contributing constructively toward self growth overall!

        " question about who slept longer -- since Harry slept 9 hours while James slept lesser amount (6), so Harrier slept 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James Did I get it right this time?. Yes, you computed correctly. To break down your process into individual steps: You determined James' duration was found using multiplication ((James')*hours) => (2/3)*(harry_sleep). This resulted in '6 hours'. Following up on our first operation finding James sleeping period as mentioned before; We established further calculation i.e., harry's remaining excess rest period over james\u2019 sleep ('extra').

Harvey therefore slept longer by just over half as much again compared to him because if you subtract their respective amounts, i.e., Harry minus James equalling 3 or nearly three quarters; thus saying \u2018more.\u2019 Therefore the difference would approximately add up to about six hours, so 'about'. Since both answers provided ('six', less numerical precision here), I can decide either could work without loss of validity based upon this contextual interpretation alone \u2013 but considering phrasing rules laid down earlier let me lean towards providing one single definitive output rather than approximations. Consequently selecting closest whole round figure matching our calculations makes sense resulting into: 6.
