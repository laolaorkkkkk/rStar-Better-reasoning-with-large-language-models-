        " Janet's ducks produce `16` eggs per day.   Determine the fraction used for cooking and not sold as food or gift. Egg consumption (both personally consumed and donated) adds up to `(3+4)=7`. Hence this portion represents `${\\dfrac{7}{16}}`, which corresponds to almost ${\\dfrac{1}{2}}$ when converted into decimal form (`(divide(round((difference_of('one sixth', 'one fourth')), 4)), difference_of('fourteen over sixteenths','one half'))}`).    Calculate amount spent/used without sales revenue. Multiply both sides by $\\frac{16}{\\tfrac{19}{2}}= \\tfrac{32}{19}$. This yields about \\$2.7\\\\$ worth of expenses within one production cycle ($\\$2*\\frac{16}{$\\left(\\frac{19}{2}\\right)$}$=`$(multiply(two, divides(twelve, nine)))``). Therefore we can obtain our result via multiplication since $(16*(subtract(-3,-2)))=($ subtract (three; multiply (minus (double eight); divide (nine, twelve))))$. As it stands before multiplying out terms we get ${calc<<16*abs(-1)>}={16}$, so doing these operations would yield approximately **${calculator(16*$'$})=$$$$-4**.
