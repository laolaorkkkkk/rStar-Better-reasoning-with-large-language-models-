        " as this involves daily activity repeated throughout the week it indicates multiplication rather than adding or subtracting which typically represents single events happening once; hence we utilized the concept of 'product'. That further solidifies why multiplying was used here instead of simply summing up individual instances. This emphasizes its importance when dealing scenarios involving repetitive actions over time span such as exercise regimens etc., making comprehension clearer. Overall understanding these mathematical principles can aid decision making related physical activities planning like calorie burning calculation based upon different workouts considering their duration too thereby leading towards better health management strategy design using mathematics! Keep practicing calculations around area/volume concepts relevant within sports context would help enhance logical thinking ability critical skill highly advantageous across various dimensions including academics career choice fields athletic coaching amongst others..
