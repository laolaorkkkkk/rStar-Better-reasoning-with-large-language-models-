Assuming Tom reached the distant location within those three hours (since no specific information was provided about any stopover or delay), if it covers 'd' miles at 10mph over 3 hours, this means that 'd=10*3', making it '30 miles'. To determine the amount of time taken for the trip back home, you would again use Distance/Speed formula; hence Time = d / Speed(return) equals to 30 Miles / 6Miles Per Hour which approximates to  5 hours. Consequently ,the overall duration including travelling forward as well as retracing steps comes out to be around ~3 hours +~5hours equalling roughly eighty minutes approximately. Therefore, It took tom nearly sixteen hours considering all circumstances mentioned above .

At first glance I see no reason why Tom would not complete a round trip since if one took away or subtracts those extra three minutes needed before reaching home again according to my calculations above but instead says less than halfway due perhaps misunderstanding instructions about changing speeds within certain intervals based upon their relationship here\u2026but let\u2019s try another way just using basic geometry principles so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need additional knowledge like trigonometry etc :D Let us assume both distances traveled during our initial departure period until arrival occur over equally distant locations relative lengthwise; thus regardless whether directional flow changes midcourse along voyage course lines while going downstream versus upwind against prevailing wind flows \u2013 only spatial dimension matters w/o regard otherwise unless stated explicitly somewhere outside mentioned specifications requiring such factors affect motion equations too!

To find out how long it takes Tom to return you need first determine what needs computing; here we require finding Time equals Distance divided by Speed.
