Add All Items Initial Cost Plus Fees/Tariffs Together Likewise you can also use percentages to find out what the overall new value would look like without having worked through individual calculations first. This saves time when dealing with large numbers but requires rounding off since most currencies don\u2019t even allow hundredths decimal places meaning less precision than desired occasionally leading to errors hence why breaking down problems might yield better long term accuracy especially during practice exams!

Hence Total bill amounts up to Taxable Amount plus extra sales charge equals Food Cost Summation+(Nonfashion Item Price*Tax rate)=(15)+(4*.1)=(15).

        " $7. These items collectively come up to $8 (for food) + $7 (nonfood)=$15 before taxes. Tax only applies for these nonfood items i.e., it doesn\u2019t apply to any amount spent on milks or eggs which amounts to $2+ $3= $5 so no need to consider them when calculating taxes as per question instructions. As such tax applicable here can calculated just over this non food item purchases worth $. Hence we take .1*7=$0.7 adding into original price results into overall expenditure being $7+$0.70 equals approximately $7.70 making sure not considering prices related to meal components like milk & eggs even though they together summed nearly half than what was asked about.. However I am seeing extra clarity needed around terms \u201ctax\u201d because its usually applied broadly across entire purchase instead isolated onto specific segment(ie if you spend XYZ whole spending qualifies towards ABC portion). Given scenario looks weird but let us go ahead w/ my first option assuming interpretation implied generic meaning while abiding law norm adherence context wise :) Final approximation thus remains ~7~dollars based upon stated conditions; hence ",

Tax rate on these was mentioned to be 10%. Hence their tax amount would come out to be 1/10th i.e., $(7*10)/100=$0.7$. Total spending including sales tax becomes Summation(cost_nonFoodItems)+taxAmountOnNonFoodItems . Substituting our values we get sum($7+$0.7$) = $7.7$. Food items include Milk & Eggs but no additional charges apply here like Sales or Import duties etc.. Cost associated wrt these being directly paid can hence stated without any deductions resulting into it coming up to just another subtraction equation ie-(SumOfCostForAllitems)-sumofitempricesforMilk&Eggs , so simply put->totalExpenses-$ItemPrice+(ItemQuantity*$itemprice);which equates back againto what already computed earlier;the above calculation process leading us towards figuring this figure right downstream!! It essentially boils down saying:\"Everything expended minus only those components pertaining specifically toward procurement costs\".
