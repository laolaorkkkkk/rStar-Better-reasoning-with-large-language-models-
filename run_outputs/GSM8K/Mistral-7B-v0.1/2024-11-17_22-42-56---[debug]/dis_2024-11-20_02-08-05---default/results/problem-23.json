Which corresponds roughly speaking to  2*4=8cm being shortened over those four hrs.. This time interval starts off as something measurable(maybe meter?) but gets subtractively reduced if you take into account all these subtractions made during one whole session of continuous dripping etc... Basically what happens here basically represents exponential decay function so our solution becomes very simple since n(time) -> infinity results eventually become zero thus making us go back only upto initial value N_0 i .e No matter HOW MUCH TIME goes UPON YOU REACHING ZERO FINALLY ALL SUMS BECOME SIMPLY THEIR ORIGINAL PARTITION SO TO THIS CASE WHAT SHE SAID MEANT IT WASN 'T EVEN CAUSING AN EXPLODANCE AT HOUGH BUT JUST KEEP ON LETTING INDIVIDUAL CANDLES ALONE AND DEDUCING ADDITIVE VARIATION OR APPROXIMATE VALUE OF RESULT AFTERL USE IF NECESSARY ;-) ..

        " 1PM until 5PM (the time duration when the candle was burning), equals a total of 4 hours (from 1pm to 2pm , from 2 pm to  3 pm , from 3 pm to  4pm .and from 4 pmo   5pm). Since one hour corresponds to melding 1 cm per centimetre so during these four hours we can say that this amount would decrease by : 1cm/hour*4hours=4centimeters less than before starting to observe which means if you took away those reduced units or measured something differently; your findings might show us another result because measurements taken based upon observations may vary depending also due factors such as air humidity etc.. Therefore instead using subtraction here subtract once again twice since observation times included within calculation period implies double count making possible results misleading therefore need applying proper mathematical concept like division firstly dividing our initial figure obtained initially into fraction equal values allowing recalculation accordingly resulting possibly leading upward higher outcomes yet still retain accuracy whilst maintain original meaning intended through research methodology undertaken thus far regardless whether actual figures remain constant across entirety study hence being able represent all relevant information accurately without compromising anything else apart numerical data itself thereby ensuring reliability throughout process completed entirely fulfill objectives set forth earlier requiring no further assistance required post computation stage beyond simply performing calculations appropriately whenever needed going forwardwards ahead next steps moving closer completion target achieved thanks help received overall effort invested toward problem solving approach applied successfully tackling complex scenarios faced repeatedly encounter problems similar ones arise occasionally occurrences become repetitive patterns formed habits develop routines followed often follow trend repeated actions occur consistently regularly forming behaviors established rituals performed almost automatically ingrained deeply routine practice adopted widely among communities practiced frequently worldwide recognized commonly known standard approaches accepted globally universally acknowledged methods utilized everywhere anywhere near anytime under circumstances typical examples illustrating general situations encountered daily experiences shared commonplace experience life events happening naturally happen ordinary incidents normalcy expected occurrence frequent event usually occurs unexpected coincidence happens seldom rarely ever unpredictable accidental incident rare exception abnormal circumstance unusual situation odd case unique particular instance specific individual peculiar characteristic distinctive quality remarkable feature special aspect noteworthy attribute exceptionality irregular pattern strange anomaly deviation default norm nonstandard behaviour variation deviated path divergent trajectory alter course change route direction alternative plan choice modified schedule adjustment agenda reschedule meeting amended appointment contact",

Consequently applying these inputs results equation becomes T*R ; using known quantities yields C*(T)=C*(Hrs); substituting value h=4 represents constant length loss experienced annually undergone continuously even though specific local variances may arise causing individual differences ultimately producing average general outcome reflective typical conditions assumed universally present wherever similar activity occurs regardless regional discrepancies potentially affecting observed measurements made locally depending situational factors surrounding particular case study analyzed involving certain scenario specified earlier requiring quantifiable data comparison analysis aimed precisely measuring exact degree extent change actually implemented uniformly maintained consistent performance standard ensured accuracy achieved desired level confidence trustworthiness established reliability confirmed precision justified conclusions drawn supported evidence validated findings verified methodologies employed guarantee scientific rigor applied strictly uphold principle objectivity impartial evaluative procedures practiced followed sound experimental design principles integrated thoroughly facilitating fair resultant verification corroboration confirm experiment replicates reproducibility tested independently allowing peer review scrutiny assurance thorough double checking measures undertaken repeatedly carried out cross validation processes executed systematic checks calibration regular quality control standards enforced strict auditing protocol adherence compliance monitored closely surveilled consistently controlled checked regularly documented comprehensively preserved records meticulously detailed compiled organized secure storage archived safely protected confidential information kept highly encrypted secured against unauthorized access intruders attempted breaches prevention proactive countermeasures deployed constantly upgrad",
