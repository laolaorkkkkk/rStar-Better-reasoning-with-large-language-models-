Good luck next round ;) :) !!

Well yea though not necessarily impossible sometimes tricky cases arise especially dealing intricate geometrical shapes particularly rectangles whose areas determine volume contained inside cylinders formed afterwards via rotated disk theory combined somehow interplay among various aspects interactively causing certain constraints upon ourselves necessitating further analysis while taking precautions making assumptions throughout entire situation considering contextual nuances present everywhere surrounding us....:-(.
