Our grandfather said once upon time someone asked him what makes ice melt quicker if placed above another container full water during winter season\u2026 It sound fun & silly right ? Well maybe not really since according too science ,when heat transfers directly from cold surfaces like metal vs wood most likely leads towards rapid melting rates compared against cool air temperatures....That means whenever u place any object near anything hot regardless its colour surface area size material type etc..you 'll still get fast temperature increase resulting faster warm weather within minutes :) Thus basically why sun shines bright every single morning!!

Here i am going ahead doing things exactly same way even thought theoretically speaking maybe not entirely accurate yet still worth trying nonetheless!

Finally if you sum all extra extras included which means only counting towards your grand total i.e not factorizing previous expenses like food items etc ,our original estimate was already rounded down but because addition requires precision here things aren\u2019t necessarily exact round numbers anymore even though previously calculated values seemed quite close enough therefore further calculating yields another value when combined withe earlier computed amounts leaving us having ended results amount approximately equalling around",
