We divide 3 eggs / hour instead simply because multiplication doesn\u2019t make sense either way around unless adding units like inches/feet beforehand.. But why multiply anything besides actual figures obtained directly offscreening data tables(as usual),since doing precisely nothing might help someone unprepared enough get away scot free?(not really). At any rate both methods still involve measuring quantities but not sure whether having them combined means something useful somehow compared maybe comparing ratios versus absolute measures later down upon further contemplation once again\u2026But right now let us ignore potential confusion altogetherand focus entirely solely within ourselves knowing perfectly clear mindedly prior knowledge already gained thus far regardless being confused myself earlier tooo...unless perhaps misunderstandings arises sometime soon though due lackadaisical approach taken previously???
