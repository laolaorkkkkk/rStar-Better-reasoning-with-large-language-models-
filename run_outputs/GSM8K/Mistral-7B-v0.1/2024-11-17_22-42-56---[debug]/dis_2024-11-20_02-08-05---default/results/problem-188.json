        " profit which includes both cost price (which was purchased and included delivery) plus additional profit ($400). Each bag was initially worth $(profit/bag)-$(cost+delivery)$. Given these values we can calculate quantity as follows: Profit_per_Bag=Revenue_Per_Bag\u2212Cost_Price=(Rate*Quantity\u2212Delivery*Total_Qty)=(Profit)*(Bkg_count)+Transportation_for_all; Rate*$bkg\\_count \u2212 Cost*(rate+$transport)_*$bkg\\_count=$($400), therefore Transportation_For_All=$(400+Rate*$quantity)^0.5.$ Quantities Sold:$q=\\frac{(400+Rate\\times q)^{0.5}}{(RessourcesUsed\\,In\\\\Production\\/Service-\\text{initial}+Delivery)\\, \\centerdot \\,ResourceUnit}$So,$q=\\frac{(400+(Rate\\,*q))^{0.5}}{((CostPerBag+\\left(\\frac{CostOfEach}{WasteFactor}\\right)\\,,resourceunit))$where Wastage Factor Is Dummy variableTo find out Resource Used During Production you need Information Which You Don't HaveHere I show solution without using mathematical modeling but solving via intuition & guessing insteadUsing Initial Value Guess :Suppose Price Was Just One More Than Original At \\$21 Let Us Assume It To Be True And Calculate Actual Number Of Baggs Using ThisAssume Its Total Weight As T kgWeightIs EqualtoNumberofBaggesWe get Two Linear EquationsWithin System:-Equatiosn$-P-T*\\centerdot v_{w}=v$$Eq1:\\quad P\\cdot Q=-W.$$ Eq2:(Lets say its just over one): $$p\\cdot L\\; =\\;\\Delta p,\\overset{\\rightarrow}{\\longrightarrow}&\\enspace {pp'\\cdot Qt}-\\delta \\;=\\Delta$.$\\iff p\u2019=\\sqrt{\\Bigl({qdt\\over dt}-qt\\bigr)}={\\biggl\\{\\pm\\,\\underbrace{\\bigg[\\,(pt)/{2^{\\color{green}+\\!{-}0}.f_{i}}\\,.e^{\\sigma}\\,\\!\\left\\{p\\,\\bigtriangleup^y,\\,N_{\\rm E},\\,\\nu^{-c},\\,K^{\\underline{h}},\\;M_a(x),\\,\\",
        " $10 per bag (from cost price) minus $2 which was spent on carrying them so net earning is just above $8 ($10-$2=$8). Since this makes up half his overall profits ie.,$400/2=$200; therefore we can determine through division only what quantity equalled out his whole transaction when multiplied against individual gain i.e.. We know one bag yielded him around $8 hence dividing $400/$8 would show us exactly how many bags went into our main equation thus resulting as being roughly 50 ((baggage count)). Final ",
        " know the overall desired earnings was $400+($2*number_of_bags). We also can calculate profits as (NumberOfBags*$ProfitPerBag), so our equation becomes $(number\\_of\\_bag$*$2) + ($number\\_of\\_bag$*$10)= $400+$($2*\\$(number\\_of\\_bag$). Let\u2019s first simplify this into algebraic form:$12*(number\\_of\\_bag)$=$400+$(2(number\\_of\\_bag))$, which further simplifies down to $-(number\\_of\\_bag)$=$-$120$\\div$(-1)$, resulting in $(number\\_of\\_bag)$ being equal to positive one hundred twenty or n=120 . Therefore , he needs to buy & sell  120 bags if you want him make those kinda of income.. That said let me explain why I used algebra :-> You didn 't provide any information about what actually happened but told your goal ;so i assume u need only find out result .. To solve such type problems mathematically simply plug values instead using simple arithmatic logic because doing just numbers gets cumbersome when dealing big set like these especially finding pattern could become nightmarish without proper tools/guidelines /algebra !
