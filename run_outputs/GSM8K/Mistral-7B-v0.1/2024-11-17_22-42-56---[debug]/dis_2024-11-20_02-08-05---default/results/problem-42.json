No calculation needed because subtraction already showed us it Total Apple Pies = Number Baked/ Per Pie Slice Easily calculatable equation thus , Calculation Equation Here :Total ",
        " piece represents one slice (as per your scenario), this means 40 total initial slices minus 14 uneaten slices equals 40 - 14 = 26 slices served or 'taken'. To determine the difference which answers your question about how many pieces were not yet serviced/consumed, it would actually refer back to what we first calculated; namely, these 26 already took place since those accounted as missing when considering leftovers. Thus if you want exactly \u201chow many pieces\u201d didn\u2019t get finished during service \u2013 based solely off info provided\u2014you cannot say definitively without knowing whether any weren't even presented initially.
