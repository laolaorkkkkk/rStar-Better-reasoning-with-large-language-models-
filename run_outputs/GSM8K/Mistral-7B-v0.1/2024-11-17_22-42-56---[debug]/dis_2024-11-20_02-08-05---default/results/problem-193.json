That comes down too roughly finding common ground under similar terms ie percentages~divides nicely without having problems during calculation thus making life easier :)!! Finally , compare results : Odd Number Of White Flamingoes Left Over Versus Even Numbers Found Earlier During Process -> Gain knowledge regarding difference made thanks comparison techniques employed earlier ; calculate gain relative proportion value accordingly .

To solve problems like the previous ones when you know all four numbers required to perform basic math operations such as addition or subtraction just subtract directly without going through other steps since we need only identify differences rather than calculate totals per se; finally write down your solution using complete sentences so it matches well what was requested here exactly instead solely indicating values which may not necessarily indicate correct reasoning especially if followed arbitrarily based upon superficial understanding thereby potentially producing erroneous results due perhaps lack either appropriate mathematical knowledge regarding principles underlying arithmetic itself hence avoid mistakes altogether whenever possible .
