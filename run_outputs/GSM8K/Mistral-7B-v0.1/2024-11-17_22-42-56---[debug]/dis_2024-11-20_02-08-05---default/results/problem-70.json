With regards to our problem statement, judging so, we need the product 'number of students* fee charged'. Thus it means multiplying the result above (total number of students) i.e., 495 by the charge made as stated ($15). To calculate Judy\u2019s income for teaching during the entirety of said duration; you multiply  495(students)*$15/student= $$_nf{7,049}. Hence Judy makes __$__.$7,049 within the time frame specified in your question.. ",
