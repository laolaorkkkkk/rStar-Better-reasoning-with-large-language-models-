As every trip results in 1 unique soulful design or pattern making another quilt block we know that all those individual items add up too being equal once again 4(year)*n(items)=total count which n turns outto be also exactly equivalent to just counting them individually ,giving us yet another valid solution i.e. itemcount=(34)-23+1 ;itemcount==12 . This means gene actually already uses only half (!!!?) than what it looks like above but not necessarily both patterns if indeed the idea meant new designs/pattern combinations based on these distinct 'block' memories; otherwise same material repeating could technically achieve desired result while saving resources! We first see here though : **each voyage yields one separate piece** hence repeated motifs would need special care when implementing their repetition into finished products--we wouldn't want duplication ruining such personalized keepsakes...
