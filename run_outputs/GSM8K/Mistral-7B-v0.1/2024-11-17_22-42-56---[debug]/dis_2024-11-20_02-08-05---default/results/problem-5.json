Since both multiplication/addition work fastest together compared alone--so let me see about taking shortcut again ... First off I remember reading somewhere back when i studied mathematics quite easily memorizing simple exponent rules regarding squaring exponents like $(a^b)^c=a^(bc)$ . Hence upon thinking carefully through what could possibly reduce working such long numbers directly onto our computer screens seems most logical perhaps leveraging knowledge acquired earlier while studying algebra related stuff mainly involving manipulating powers alongside polynomials etc.. Therefore allowing us save precious computing power & memory resources even though may not necessarily sound ideal initially considering tedious calculations needed anyway right ;-) Anyway despite having no access towards graphical interfaces neither advanced calculators available nor third parties who provide free services online capable rendering math formulas automatically therefore sticking purely old fashion handwriting based calculation methods become necessary hence requiring great patience yet making use smart tricks applied thus reducing overall computation demands significantly improving efficiency within certain cases especially dealing large values due their intensive nature ..

To calculate amount saved per pair I multiply $5 which means Price difference within pairs ($5-$5*0.6) multiplies Amount Paired Glasses Total savings $(5-(5*.6)). Finally subtract this cost reduction per unit times ordered units sold ((Price Difference Per Unit)*(Quantity Ordered)) or totals spent off original spend based on quantity purchased [(original_price/quantity)-total_saved]. Using these formulae below shows what happened over time using iteration instead; you can also derive it back into algebra if needed : Quantities | Original Cost   $$|       ---      ||        5    ----        =>$$$(ordered_qty*prc)/paired=(Order QTY)(Prices/$PRICE)=SPENDED*(1-(SAME PRICED UNIT TIMES SAME PRICES SAVING RATE X ORDER LOWER SIZE)$$\\begin{array}{|cl} \\text { Number } & \\text { Of Units Sold } \\\\ \\hline\\text{Original SPN}=& \\$ 100\\\\                          \\ &= (\\$5)\\times(\\frac{\\mathrm{orders}}{\\mathrm{unit}})               &=\\ \\$5\\times 16=&\\$80             \\\\           &\\mathbf{(Cost Saved)}&=(\\$0.6)\\times(\\frac{\\mathrm{units}}{2})                &=\\ \\$0.3\\times 16=\\$4.8              \\quad&&Total Spent:(cost*\\left[purchase -\\ right discount rate\u00d7order size\\%right])=\\$.38 (=.\\$8-\\.$4.8)=\\$\\text {Final Payment}=\\$}} 38 . \\end{array}$ Thus having used iterations once here above allows us see our output would look like so ; Iteration Result:[($\\,\\,\\,$) , $\\, \\,$, $(\\,\\,)$ , ... ]+[$5 \\cdot \\;\\,x\\; $, '$((5-)'(.)(.($),...]$+$[\\,(.,)\\,]+[\\;\\;[(6) \\cdot ($\\$)', '\\dots']$; And showing all amounts listed out via code results such That when summed produce your expected result calculated earlier Such Summation Formula:$result={\\sum",
