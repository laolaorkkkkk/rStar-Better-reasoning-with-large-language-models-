And according to Condition 2, next year if I add both sides together this happens; (Brooke\u2019s current Age+2) +(Seth\u2019s current Age+2)= 28 or ((x+2)+(2x+2))=28 which simplifies into  3x + 4 = 28 which becomes when further simplified equals   3x = 24 so      x       =     eight but remember first equation said brooks present age was equal half seths . Thus making it eight divided again therefore saying seth aged fourteen while bresloe only six all seems correct upon checking back against original equations since twelve plus eighteen make thirty one not twenty seven proving our guess wrong yet still trying other possibilities until eventually seeing clearly what can go right because nothing else adds up exactly here except maybe another math problem involving different numbers being used just instead let us look closer starting over keeping track using proper notation like writing out those things above would lead anyone reading through everything easily enough especially kids who might struggle otherwise possibly even adult non mathematicians alike looking straight ahead rather than rushing headlong thinking \u201cugh why aren\u2019t these adding up?\u201d No sir no mam!
