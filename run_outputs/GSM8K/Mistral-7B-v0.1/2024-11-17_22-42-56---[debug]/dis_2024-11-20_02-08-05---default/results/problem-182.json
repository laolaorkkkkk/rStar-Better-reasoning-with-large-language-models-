We know also Jesse who is said to be two years elder to Mark therefore if Jeans makes three people younger than him its because she only made one difference relative to jean being not as young but instead having ages differences greater due to passage of time such that you need compensate once year per person involved , hence Julie adds another plus point adding two more years compared to original gap found between Jean & Mork before both aging thereby resulting into summed up figure :(2)+((Mark\u2019s present Age))+(2)=3+(<<18=18>>)(original calculation used above)+2 .

We plugged into this condition all values we know about people excepting themselves; thus equation one becomes(M)-2 >((30\u22122))/2. Solving our first inequality shows usthat M<13 . Since no matter who else ages up but these individuals , everyone gets bigger so their relative position stays constant during time lapse; hence M cannot take any value greater nor equal to 14. Hence option B works because if you solve for J using Equation One while ignoring signage (-), both conditions seem satisfied simultaneously which means mark could possibly exist within bounds set above under assumptions made earlier.

Therefore adding fourteen ([thirty minus eleven=[27]] plus[three=twelve)) makes him eighteen forty three months or fifteen seventeen seven fourths (=seventy six point so ten five][one month per year approximately]=fifteen years.)
