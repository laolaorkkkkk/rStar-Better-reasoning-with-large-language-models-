Accordingly calculate new required velocity based on existing conditions using the formula `distance=speed*time`. Speed obtained above might not necessarily indicate faster walking but means maintaining constant speeds throughout hike which could still meet overall target goal i.e., mean 4mph regardless of individual leg segment paces since different sections contribute equally towards computing aggregate avg rate over all traveled section.
