That means if there are 30 vehicles overall, including these new ones, you need to take away 10 because it was only present when the first pair came through, leaving us with (30-10), which equals 20 additional imports! This accounts for (20/5)*2=8 extra boxes arriving later since every container held exactly 'five'. Thus, this tells us there were eight containers received aside form the initial count on Monday morning. Hence your correct reply will indicate : **eight** .
