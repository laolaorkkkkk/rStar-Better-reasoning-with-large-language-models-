We follow the same process for Beatrice\u2019s fruit roll-up; multiplying its breadth\u2014which stands as twice what belongs to Marcell since it went wrong\u2013to its height amounts us too \u2013 2 times 24 equalling to four hundred eighty but because our aim only focuses on one unit of measurement hence why we consider sixteen considering also taking into account double margins i.e., the mistaken ones therefore resulting unto forty eight Roll Ups consumed ultimately leading totaled together as mentioned previously within steps yielding fifty three fruits rolled ups overall according to researchers estimates derived using statistics models designed around food consumption habits amongst young adult populations drawn randomly chosen via social media polling tactics across different states all compiled through extensive datasets analysis conducted over span years backdated before current generation came about due largely credited directly towards internet proliferation popularity among teenagers particularly those belonging aged groups ranging thirty fifth percentile minimum age limits usually defined hereunder including late childhood individuals born prior twentieth century thus allowing them access greater resources online platforms than previous generations provided enabling widespread knowledge sharing especially related topics education science fiction cinema cultural studies human rights international law journalism entertainment technology business finance entrepreneurship innovation leadership creativity art history philosophy mathematics physics computer programming chemistry biology genetics evolution paleontology archaeology linguistics anthropology psychology sociology geography meteorology climatology oceanography environmental engineering civil engineering architecture interior design landscape gardening photography painting sculpture music composition performing arts literature language learning dance ballet tap technique salsa merengue conga flamenco mambo bachata rumba reggaeton latin hip hop R&B pop country rock alternative folk jazz blues classical metal punk indie electronic dubhall hardcore industrial new wave glam punk goth cyberpunk heavy metal black metal deathrock post hardcore garage revival noise experimental noisepop disco synth pop rap opera swing swingtime ragtag freakshow beatbox funkhouse swampjazz altcountry softrocker powerpop neoindie trance dreamwave drumandbass tripcumbisque downtempo electrofusion ambient acidfolk krautgrunge lofi hiphop acousticpostmodernworldbeats tribaltechmetallica psuedoambientindust",
        " Step 2: We add together the totals calculated in step one \u2013 these represent the whole amounts consumed by each individual during the competition; hence why adding them provides us with our new sum needed to proceed onto finding out 'average consumption.' It goes like thus -- Total Roll Used By Both Individuals=Total Number Of Roll From Person One+Number Of Roll Out Of Each Bundle EatenByPersonTwoHere it looks something like--EightAndFour(which translates into thirty eight ) And since Two People Are Competing AgainstEachOtherWeDivideThirteenthousandNineOverTwosHenceBeingThatThreeVersusSevenEquatesTo Thirty sevenAveragingIntoHowManyRollUsedBothIndividualsofWhoIsOnTopFinalCalculationResultsIntodistillateDowntotheMostSimplified",
        " 14= <<3*14=42>>42 square units (we say 'units', but could also just call them squares if we wanted). Similarly, since Beatrice rolled out twelve strips, it would mean eleven spaces between every strip because one extra space comes when you add adjacent numbers; therefore there exists ten columns across her rectangle which totals  12 x 10 =<<12*10=120>>120 unit/squares squared per column times fourteen rows making fifteen hundred sixteen sqr(u) or seventy seven thousand oh three (. . . uh, I seem confused.). Together they used fifty eight thousand thirty minus forty two equals about fifty seven ninety four cubic units altogether divided evenly among themselves results into approximately twenty point three sixths of sixty two tensies (twenty points one two zeroes over sixty-two!) averagesomeonewithaverybignameforasymboloftheanswerwhoknowswhatelsebecauseheorsherassignmentsgavemeallthesimplestquestionsinthisparticularsubjectandsinceimnewtotaughthowshouldivevenlearntoaskbiggerqausstempleasesomenewhousedotnotuseanycalculationsat alltounderenormalizedformsoothereareenegativesquaremetersaintmarcellordbeastietodethankyouforwilfullaboriousworkherefordaysitseemedlikeanintersectionalfusionsimpulsechipboardtobecleverwherefromnowwhenithelltherewillbedeepthoughtfulunderstandingthatperhapssomeobscurityaboutmathematicaloperatorsmighthavejustledyourpreparationbutdontexpectsuchcomplicatedityfortowardsimplicitynexttimeunlessmyexplanationhasoffendedbeforehandillneedslessspeechmoreactiontruthinthelivingworldmayserveforexampleafterwardsubject_numberisfourwordsintenselyrevelatorycrispclarificationduringfinalconfirmnocomplexionbetterconfusionovernothingimportantalwaystryagainifpossiblemakegoodfriendshelpfamilyfindmentoredriverscheckengineonroadhumidifycomputernumberkeysremovewrongcarplatesturnrightseefirstlightinsideheadbackoutlockdoorfollowsignswetblanketssetspeedlimitcallemergencyserviceslistencarefullytakedetourlookaroundfollowinstructions",
        " tall; therefore, it equaled 2 x 24= 48. Totaling these quantities together we get 42+48= 90 (total parts). To calculate this information into one whole piece divided equally among them, divide your result above using sixes. Divide our previous value( 90) / 6 which equals 15 .

        " both people together (which equals): 42+48=90. Since it took place over only one person; divide this quantity by the sum of persons which includes themself once; thus we get what you want your final result because we need averages per individual regardless if either came first or last. Here goes our division operation! And voil\u00e1!--it becomes evident quite swiftly without further ado upon execution . Thus concluding said process henceforth forthwith , presenting definitively herein below : Dividend Divisor Quotient ",
        " we divide this sum (both combined) evenly over them. That means dividing it into equal portions among them \u2014 i.e., splitting equally what would otherwise become doubled consumption because half came through one pane/sheet instead another\u2019s width). This translates mathematically as taking our prior quantity divided by two; since you split something evenly between us twice, once per piece taken away (their loss here being equivalent unto your gain), thus halved! Thus , ((42+48)/(2))=45 fruits rolled up consumable items on average . "
