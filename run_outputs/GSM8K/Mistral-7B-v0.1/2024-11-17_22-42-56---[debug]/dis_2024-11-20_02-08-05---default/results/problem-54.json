Subtract what happens next \u2013 we know something happened! Their second mum told us about another addition; this time, only one pregnancy came into play instead of three times as before but still yielding twelve baby furbabies\u2026 adding those eleven offspring plus seventeen already existing brings you closer toward concluding figure X+X=XX , so combine everything up.. You would say XX-(XXX)=Y being equal value means summing up your count(kittens).

Add these figures together along with the ones mentioned about Trixie \u2013 which would involve adding those numbers up too plus any others not listed but can reasonably inferred like so: Total Kittens= Original Seven+Twenty One FromPatchey+ Twelve fromTrixey.
