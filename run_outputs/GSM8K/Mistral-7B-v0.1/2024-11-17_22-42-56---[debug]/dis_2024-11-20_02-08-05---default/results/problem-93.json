Therefore when considering those differences against geralds previous best personal records...we see quite clearly why someone might get discouraged!

With a 10% improvement due to his new diet, Gerald\u2019s speed increased enough so his running times decreased accordingly. To calculate this we need to increase (improve) Gerald\u2019s original time by taking away ten percent off. Ten percent off 40seconds calculates as follow : Multiply your initial amount(which equals forty), you multiply fourty*(ten/a hundred)=fourty*point zero one . We add these values ,and get our result thirty eight point six secondes.(38.6 sec). Because when calculating decimals always look out if not only minutes or hours but even small units like secs matter here; hence no rounding up necessary unless asked explicitly later because all parts count equally thus leading us directly towards three different options provided above without having simplified any further ; although simple fraction calculations could also yield similar results under certain interpretations \u2013 don\u2018t forget those sometimes either!

Hence ultimately choosing amongst listed alternatives requires cautious thinking beyond obvious logic gaps appearing superficially ..In conclusion based upon discussed analysis opt b appears closest matching actual scenario despite seemingly vague details concerning potential contributing factors influencing outcome differently across individual cases alike... Consequently answering question therefore align itself closely approximating probable solution offered via same reasoning sequence shown earlier..

This makes him better when adding all times taken together...so instead of having one negative sign next totalling their combined effort because both made progress since starting these activities\u2014when doing something positive overall you get closer towards zero making your efforts collectively even stronger thus we need subtraction here! Hence,(original_time \u2013 improvement)-newcomer\u2019s addition=(((old-(improvement*old))+(new)). Substituting values into our expression yields us :  \t|38 -(0.1*38)| .

However let\u2019s remember while setting those figures aside since these values might still matter depending upon individual factors such age etc.), consider them irrelevant so using just numbers alone allows us solve through mathematical means instead focusing solely towards finding out whether someone else could potentially finish within another world hour range possibly coming close enough together making both races seem almost interchangeable despite different circumstances surrounding why specifically only particular scenarios may allow certain results occur rather trying hard guesses regarding possible situations occurring outside normal expectations . As mentioned above , considering everything taken into account but removing all assumptions made elsewhere besides actually testing physical capability level vs comparison test against already established baselines set way back previously known data points helps narrow things down quickly whereas leaving nothing uncertain except actual facts related specific situation being analyzed right away reduces overall error margin significantly increasing probability success rates achieving desired targets reached throughout process involving competitive sports disciplines including track & field events like sprint / midfielder position racing categories alike challenged tasks performed athletically well beyond average standards displayed routinely seen common everydays among others doing similar jobs often considered very low risk areas most likely wouldn't necessarily need additional preparation unlike professionals dealing professional business dealings requiring highly specialized knowledge base acquired via extensive training programs undertaken individually versus collectively organized team settings ensuring everyone involved benefits personally economically financially nonetheless providing opportunity improve performance skills otherwise unavailable purely because personal preference choices cannot always determine outcome unless applied strategic approaches best suited unique individuals character traits characteristics strength weakness differences experience background work ethics determining direction focused future paths follow ultimately impacting real life decisions influence quality relationships colleagues peers family community circles social networks support system available",
