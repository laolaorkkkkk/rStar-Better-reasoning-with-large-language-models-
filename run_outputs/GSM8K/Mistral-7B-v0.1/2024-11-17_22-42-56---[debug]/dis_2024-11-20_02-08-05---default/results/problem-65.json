As stated earlier, Jim also likes to read books which takes him about double the time spent on TV or rather thrice since its three times longer than usual one hour sessions. To calculate the amount of hours spent on reading we multiply twice the duration of bingeing television show i.e., reading lasts 2*3=6 hrs but happens just once every other activity hence leads us to find out only third part of overall tv viewership so therefore dividing these additional 6hrs across our already found value yields(2+6)/3 approximately equal to 8/3 equalling roughly around .9 units of regular watch session equivalent thus cumulatively translating into approx  6+(.9)= 6.9 hours altogether if taken over entire span encompassing four weeks taking whole picture holistically including all variables such family activities during recreational periods outside household members daily interactions etc..
