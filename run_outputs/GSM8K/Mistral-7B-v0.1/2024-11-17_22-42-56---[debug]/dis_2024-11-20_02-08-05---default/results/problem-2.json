An increase of 150% represents three times plus half its original price i.e., it doubles itself firstly(which would be like adding another hundred percent) so we need to add this amount separately because our percentage rise was over twice what needed calculation alone thus if you double something initially ($80k+($80k*0.5))= $120 k+$40k=$160 thousand but only once! We want them both together which results into being greater than their combined base values--$200k here indicates exactly just one time multiplied before taking other factors under consideration along side already existing expenses per previous calculations above...

Determine what percentage increase would result from adding half of your original investment (initial purchase price plus any additional renovations) as one can assume this approach typically results in selling or renting profitable returns. To calculate these values multiply .5(your current expenditure+purchase/repair fees)=$65,000*(.5=)$32,500Add up all previous amounts again including extra gains due to improvements ((current spending amount)+((half)*spent)). As such if we take our prior totals mentioned previously; Original Purchased Home Price + Renovation Cost = Total Invested Amount($80k+$50k=$130k), Half Spent Extra Gain Value=(Total_Investment*.5=$65k)Gross Profit From Improvements $(%total improvement*$extra gain)/100(%improvement=$150%,Extra gained income-$value/$extraction %)$. Therefore ,if you plug the above into the equation it simplifies down like so: $$[(Spent_Extract)^.15]+Original_Amount^.5$$which therefore equals : **$[{(Prior Expenditure)(Profitability)}]** which equates to approximately **$[${ExpendedValueOfHome}*{PercentageReturnOnImprovements}+${InitialHousePrice}$ ]****Applying specific numbers yields the following solution:$[{Currently invested+(Cutoff HALF X Return FROM IMPROVES)}(Previous Values)]+$ Initial House Value:-${[-$({Invested*(Rate Of ROI})}]}+\\{${-($80K)}\\}=(-$.98M$\\approx$-$(88K))So ultimately subtracting negative change from overall sumyieldestimate gross return $$\\Rightarrow   \\textbf {~$A Net Estimate ~~of~~a $-88k Earnings Based Upon These Premised Probabilities.} \\tag{$\\text{ }$)**This particular methodology might not yield actual earnings accurately but rather serve only as hypothesis testing regarding possible outcomes during financial endeavors.(Note:These calculations rely upon approximate rates without consideration of tax.)Also consider potential liabilities involved in re",

Subtract original purchase amount plus repair cost minus this newly calculated 'full price,' meaning it would sell for if sold immediately following these upgrades: $((195,000)-(130,000))=($65,000)$. That means Josh\u2019s project could bring him nearly double what he initially invested when you take into consideration any market appreciation as well.. Therefore your conclusion seems wrong according to our computations but considering real estate investment situation usually not just about simple numbers calculation., since its riskier compared to other types because one needs also factoring potential housing market downturn or unexpected expenses like legal fees during sale process etc.... Also remember while doing calculations sometimes ignore tax implications unless mentioned specifically otherwise. To sum things up using basic math rules above stated here however we can say theoretically assuming all goes smooth without hiccups selling later post upgrade might yield closer figure around ~$165k profits including both spent cash flow till point being considered along w/ return based solely upon direct monetary comparison methods provided thus offering relatively solid groundwork albeit subjective nature dependent largely variance external variables playing role overall outcome especially long term vs short sighted perspective respectively...

It shows poor judgment without guaranteeable returns making such approach quite risky especially considering market fluctuations. Profit cannot directly be calculated as asked because based upon provided details till completion no net proceeds available yet hence not possible determine exact monetary gain/loss figure.

The answer isn't simply about finding out additional costs or sales; it actually involves understanding potential earnings against investments too. Since no actual sale was mentioned, this scenario indicates financial losses rather than gains. Hence, calculating 'profit' as traditionally defined (earnings minus initial input including operating ones like labor & overhead doesn\u2019t apply here since selling wasn\u2019t part.)

Account for the repair cost which was $50,000: Total investment = Initial Cost ($80,000) + Repair Cost ($50,000) => Total Investment = $130,000. Finally calculate net gain/loss (Profit / Net Investment): Using formula as mentioned above ((New Value \u2013 Purchase Price )\u2009\u2013\u2009Repairs)/Net Investment=($120,000-$80,000)-$50,000)/$130,000=(-$10,000). Therefore, using this approach, it seems like instead of making a profit based off the initial scenario described, Josh actually experienced a financial loss due to high expenses related to maintaining or remodeling these properties. However, if considered purely over short term gains rather than return on overall capital input, he indeed gained initially. Here\u2019s another take considering strictly monetary output vs inputs without long view consideration; therefore, answering directly referring back to your first line asking about direct earnings post renovation but not yet including rehab costs\u2014we find those actual profits stand independent around approximately half again what he paid out solely pertaining to improvements themselves prior calculations showing negative sum when factoring all aspects together still hold true especially looking beyond just raw cash exchanged hands within property transactions alone & ignoring longer time spans typical seen regarding real estate ventures involving such activities!
