        " rounded these sales totals up to the next whole integer because you cannot sell partial amounts when dealing with physical products like individual plants/flowers. Here\u2019s what happens if it was rounded down instead; assuming the same calculation before but using floored division which essentially rounds towards zero as opposed to standard ceiling function used previously here: Sale sum without any adjustment equals (rounded_amount(total[Marigold]*quantity[Marigold])+ rounded_amount(total[Petunia] * quantiry [Petunia]) + rounded amount Total[Begonia] * Quantity [Begonia]). Hence applying this floor strategy wouldn't yield substantial differences henceforth affecting overall businesses since most transactions generally rely heavily upon precise calculations rather than approximations due to accountability purposes among others such economic considerations involving profit loss analysis etc.. But still worth mentioning though slight difference caused might appear miniscule nonetheless important especially considering long run implications overtime concerning market competition dynamics including customers trust levels involved thus making sure correct sums paid returned ensure sustainable growth & reputation retention goals maintained across board!

Petunias come out to $1.87/pot multiplied by 9 pots which equals $16.83 but rounded down becomes $16 since this doesn\u2019t reach another whole dollar increment when increased above it without changing into thousands) Begonia sales calculated as follows; $2.12/$per pot price * 17pots results in approximately $36. But again considering integer values only ,we get value around ($2*17=$34),which rounds off our figure even further . Therefore according totals obtained upon applying basic arithmetic calculations followed accordingly ;$32+$16+$34= resultant sum being exactly $82 based strictly onto mathematical operations applied herewithin contextual boundaries presented beforehand henceforth!

        "*12=$32.88 which rounds off to about $33 (rounding up because anything below .5 goes down). Petunias are sold at $1.87 per pot and artie sold 9 pots so this means its ($1.87)*(9) or approximately $17 (since it doesn\u2019t go beyond halfway point when rounded.) Begonias are being offered at $2.12 but only one time as well since we always multiply numbers before adding them together hence$((2.12)(1))~$2.(Because again none went past .5 way) Finally add what was previously obtained; That would mean that $(33)+(17+2)=$<<33+(17+2=)?>>$52.. therefore if you summed those amounts , the resultant amount comes out around approx $52,. This indicates exactly $52 can be expected upon sale of these respective flora commodities...so....their value estimated standsoutasapproximatelyfiftyandtwenty cents.....This leaves uswith ouranswer:$52 Total.",
        " thus making $1.87 x 9 = $16.83 revenue on petunias. Begonias yield about $2.12 x 17 = $35.94 when rounded upwards (as we\u2019re considering only whole numbers). Add these amounts together to find out how much artie earns if you sum up the revenues earned from every individual kind of blooms i.e., Total Earnings = ($32.88)($16.83)+$35.94= around approximately $88 because price adjustments due to lacking coins render any cents irrelevant; therefore rounds it down henceforth resulting into this approximate value mentioned above which excludes fractional currency not accountable within current calculations \u2013 but without precise fractions present let alone exact ones thereby leaving us rather unable precisely determine monetary gain using traditional calculation methods as would normally apply otherwise!
