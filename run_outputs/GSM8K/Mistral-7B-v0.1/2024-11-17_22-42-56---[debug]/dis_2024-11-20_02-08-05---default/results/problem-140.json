To find out what portion remains 'semi-automatic', subtracting it from the overall count would yield its quantity i.e., 20-(or original count)-(partially automatics)=20-16 (=4).

Therefore it appears I made mistake initially when defining categories because these descriptions overlap considering most modern rental car companies offer only one type per vehicle due to regulations.

Here it would lead us to \\( \\frac{Semico\\ automatic}{Total} =\\frac{Semiauto}{All}=\\frac{4/20}{1}=0.2\\). To express this ratio into percentages we multiply its numerator divided by denominator times hundred, i.e., take our result (\\(\\frac{4}{20}\\)) multiplied by ten or divide only denominator by itself but raise power equal to unity lesser than coefficient of nominator namely twenty fourth rather having common multiplication through both nominees; hence finally getting desired probability rate P=(four)/twenty \u00d7a hundred=[nominator/(denominator)]\u00d7[percentage]=\\(P=[\\frac{\\text { SemiAuto}}{\\text { All }}]\\)\u00d7[percent]= [pct)=20% .

Subsequently convert such ratio to desired unitary measure like percentages using multiplying factor known generally equaling one hundredth [1% equals to .01]. Following mathematic operations here involves reducing calculated value down towards zero through division while also adjusting its magnitude upward following standardized conversion rule stated above.
