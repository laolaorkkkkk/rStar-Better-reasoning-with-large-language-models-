Hence the starting point was approximately three tens or twenty dollars plus thirty cents would put it closer but still within range of our round figures; thus suggesting about $20 as being plausible here based upon proximity principles when working directly off estimated calculations not absolute precisions especially considering coin values etc could slightly affect such approximations unless stated otherwise explicitly .
