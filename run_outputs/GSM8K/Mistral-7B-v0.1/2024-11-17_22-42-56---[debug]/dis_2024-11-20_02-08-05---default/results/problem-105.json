        " cookies as Amir. Together, it means they would consume all their cookespread across time frame. Therefore if amiri consumes one cookie per hour and cody takes tripled rate compared to him we calculate firstly average amount consumed during single session equalizing quantity divided over unit duration which results into summed consumption being achieved once entirety expended through designated hours multiplied thus (Amirs_rate*Hours) +(codys_rate*(amirs_rate)*hours).

That would look like one finger held up, another two fingers shown adding upto four \u2026 until our last counting says fifteen..adding twelve totalling eighteen altogether\u2026so far no problem I know right!! But wait....there was something missing here earlier when answering my question because you didn \u2019 ve included anything related toward finding ALL THEM TOGETHER meaning their \u201ctogetherness\u201d. It doesn ;t matter if someone else comes along later but instead only focuses upon themselves whoever gets chosen among these options?? Why not simply list every option available AND ADD IT UP FOR ANY EVENTUAL FURTHER DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN PEOPLE?. Hopefully clear enough even though im still unsure abut its relevance otherwise good luck getting rid oof confusion over such things \u2013 especially ones involving numbers!!! Let us sum it again; firstly lets see exactly HOW MANY COOKIES AMIR WILL CONSUME THIS GAME DAY !:- One way i guess could 've found wanna start off knowing...Amari wants twice less sugars per meal plus having fewer servings daily??? Well let \u2018 s assume average sugar intake during breakfast equals about twenty grams hence eight hundred seventyfive remains minus seven hundrefiftyseven leaving thee quarters remainder thirtyfour ?
