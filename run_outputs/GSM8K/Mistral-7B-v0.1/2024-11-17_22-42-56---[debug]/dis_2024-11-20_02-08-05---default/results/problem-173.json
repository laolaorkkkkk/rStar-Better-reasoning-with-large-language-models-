To find out how much she pays in one year (which consists of 12 months), we multiply this amount by 12 because there are twelve months in a year. Therefore, she would spend or save 1500*12=18000 dollars within a year if she adheres strictly onto making such extra payments towards her different types of debt like mentioned above.
