Develop your argument referencing both specific philosophical constructs and wider social impact considerations related to ecotheology informed by human exceptionalism as envisioned by Aquinas but expanded upon by later Scholastic thought including critiques provided by Thomas Aquinas (Duns Scotus) himself.*[/INST]: Saint John Duns Scotus, known primarily for his contributions to metaphysics, offers insights significant when considering modern interpretations of Christian doctrine concerning environmental stewardship and ecotheology. His philosophy underscores particular attention to individuation \u2013 the distinctive attributes accorded to each entity created by God, suggesting nuance beyond Thomistic natural law principles espoused earlier by St. Thomas Aquinas. Where Aquinas viewed humankind somewhat apart due to intellect ('rational nature'), positioning humans to govern nature according to reason and utility \u2014 albeit still fundamentally part of order established by their Creator \u2014 Scotus introduces depth via 'univocity', meaning terms applicable equally across entities also possess unique qualities worthy of respect and moral consideration regardless of rational capacity alone; even nonhuman creatures carry value not merely instrumentally (\"as means\") but intrinsically (\"beyond mere utilitarian function\").
