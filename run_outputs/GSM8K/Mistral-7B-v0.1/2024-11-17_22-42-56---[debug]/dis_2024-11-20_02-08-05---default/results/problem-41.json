Therefore, we calculate this extra distance first before finding out the maximum throwing capacity while also considering safety margin against dragon\u2019s flight zone. First compute doubled distance which equates to safe armour distance beyond Reach but ensure its minimum value equals required safe throw away i.e., Dragons Flight Zone minus Original Distance(for example). Since Dragon reaches upto 1 kilometer whereas Safe Throw Range doubles original max so DoubleSafeThrowRange= MaxDistance*PolyEfficiencyRate*(MaxDragDist/OriginalMinimum)= MinDistancesafetyMargin+(PolyEfficencyrate)*((MaxDragDist/(Requiredthrowaway+ReqMinus)) This translates into equation; `DoubleThrownjavelin=maxdist*(requiredthrowsafetmargins/(originalminvalue)+polyeffciency)`. We know all variables except desired throwsafe margine here which would need calculation through rearrangement & manipulation using basic algebra principles provided earlier starting point values ,solving yields ~\u20095 kilometers.\r\rFinally, add back minumum distancing requirement just over ranges covered leading us towards our conclusion around roughly  5 Kilometers . It means under any circumstance regardless what happens even though being attacked by fierce creatures like 'Perg' whose heat may possibly damage one physically during fight due strong magic protection used till such time doesn't interfere let alone getting killed directly unless you arenot very lucky ; however no harm yet expected since person won`nt get too close otherwise making matters worse furthermore keeping things manageable ensuring long life span ultimately maintaining overall survival rate.. As demonstrated above calculating distances involves determining factors including efficiency rates based largely off personal characteristics unique situations encountered often found challenging especially having unpredictability involved requiring careful consideration prior planning hence taking advantage accordingly whenever possible always good advice generally speaking knowing limits already established provides solid foundation moving forward thus providing critical insight needed toward successful navigation potential opportunities present despite uncertain nature affecting most aspects daily routines involving every living creature whether humans animals aliens robots etc\u2026 ",

This means calculating product [initial_distance] multiply[extra_factor], equalling max possible jumpers thrown distance \u2013 thereby determining the furthest safe point beyond Dragon Flame Zone .
