To find out about these we need to use all provided information which tells us exactly what was spent on feeding these creatures. Accordingly, Russell uses only 160 units of food exclusively amongst hammies & rats. Since we know he allocated 18 units towards serving the rats already, let\u2019s deduce their cost off the table.
