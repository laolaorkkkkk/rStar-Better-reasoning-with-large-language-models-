To find out how many whole boxes of pizza this amounts to, divide $17 / $8.50 per box equals approximately 2 when rounded down because you cannot buy fraction parts of a box. Hence, Marie would get around 2 whole boxes. Thus, the correct option here seems off since typically such problems intend people to round up or use remainder operations instead of approximations without mentioning them explicitly within problem parameters hence it might require clarification .

Secondly; it indicates all items combined came out to be valued at $50 in sum without considering additional purchases yet.
