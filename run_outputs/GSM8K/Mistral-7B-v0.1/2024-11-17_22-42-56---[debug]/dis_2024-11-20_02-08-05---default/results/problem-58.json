Therefore we take off both delivery and tip which adds up to ($3+ $4) =$7. Without these services it would come down to $33(=$40-$7), meaning everything else except sales tax/service markups made about $33 worth altogether i.e., only food items being talked here hence initially you start subtracting those too making your real starting value as close possible going forward to solely factor in markup prices like their listed percentage above; leaving us nothing better than assuming no discount etc.; so assume first thing put together brings sum around approximately something nearer zero unless mentioned otherwise during process . But since not specified explicitly , lets work within such presumption !!! That means our calculation starts from basically beginning line post shipping & gratuity already attached!

Adding these together gets us $50 ($40+$10). They\u2019re charging another flat rate shipping/delivery fee which comes out just underneath their estimate amount so if you ordered something big enough its likely worthwhile requesting them remove those kinda fees! Finally note here; please keep payments clean & discreet during holiday shopping seasons \u2013 especially around Black Friday events like Thanksgiving Day weekends when people often go overboard spending unnecessarily\u2026but I digress into personal finance topics beyond my scope anymore :P .

        " question about additional charges being applied as follows (see steps below).   Step One Calculate service charge. Convert percentage into decimal; therefore 25% equals .25 or simply divide initial amount by four ($40 / 4) equaling $10.
