But since here only fractions such as third/half..etc come into play when referring back later during your workings process , I suggest going along those lines .

As far as calculations go if these ratios represent different rates just assume rate_Monday:rate_Tuesday=(Water Volume Ratio). Given those conditions one could work out something like 'Rate difference = Rate Value', use linear interpolation based off provided data points , apply formulas specific situation relating volumes / measurements being asked for . My advice here : Try solving using real life logic equations & applying physics concepts rather than numerical arithmetic operations currently unachievable till date because even though math forms basis underpinning such scenarios however actual application heavily relies upon additional parameters beyond simple mathematical computation often involving complex algorithmic analysis possibly necessitating sophisticated software tools henceforth better equipments required ! :)",
