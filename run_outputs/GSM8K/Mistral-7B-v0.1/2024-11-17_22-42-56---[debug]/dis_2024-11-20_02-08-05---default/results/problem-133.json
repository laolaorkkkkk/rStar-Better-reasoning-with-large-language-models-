Sixteen represents one part while twenty eight represented seven parts because seventeen plus ten equal eighteen but we need twelve extra ones so I thought about multiplying twentioeight into eleven . It didn\u2019t work too well since if i divided fourty minus thirtyplustwo ,nine would remain unaccounted hence my next attempt multiply them together which worked! Yes indeedy what you just described makes perfect sense right before getting confused again regarding whether addition might somehow add these distances apart rather than combining those combined values themselves thus bringing forth confusion among readers who may not understand completely yet why division couldn\u2018work better under certain circumstances due such differences concerning subtraction using base numbers alone although no matter whom explains clearly could see mistakes easily enough considering both techniques seem very efficient especially when solving various calculations involving multiplication followed instantly afterwards without having any doubt myself personally speaking simply adding whatever came off first along side similar operations later making everyone feel assured regardless perhaps even less confident knowing nothing wrong ever happened until finding yourself struggling mentally trying harder sometimes feeling discouragement creeping upon almost wanting never wanted anymore hoping someone else solve errors instead writing paper showing others reading stuff besides himself causing frustration caused mainly stemming inside person thinking nobody cared despite taking time checking answers properly doing research verifying correctness every single chance possible unless finally stopping worrying once heard something intelligible explaining precisely everything exactly detailed correctly helping resolve question quicker thereby relieving mind worries relaxing stress levels reducing anxiety significantly lower down below zero degree measuring positively higher upside benefiting greatly improving quality living standards ultimately achieving goals worth striving diligently pursuing forevermore progressing towards realizing dreams desiring happier future beyond imagination limitless possibilities only limited boundaries exist within ourselves setting limits externals reality itself boundlessly creating infinite opportunities everywhere waiting patiently eager willing participate actively involved constructive effort inspires success motivation drives determination fuel innovations generating fresh ideas new concepts exciting experiences unique adventures thrilling discoveries rewarding rewards fulfillment pleasure satisfaction delight joy happiness peace content calm serenity harmony unity cooperation collaboration team spirit mutual respect understanding kindhearted compassion listening ears headph",
        " miles). That leaves us with 28 - 4 which equals 24 miles. But this represents only what he would not get if we took away just one walking session instead all three sessions combined. To deduce precisely how far he went during third time period i.e., on Wednesday; thus divide overall distance traveled over these first coupled hours(Monday & Tuesday)=[total=28]/number of trips=[trip per hour]= [distance covered][time spent] hence=(Total Distance Travelled)/Number Of Trips   [(SumOfAllDistancesWalked/DaysTaken)]-(DistanceTravelledOverAHourMultipliedByEachTripsPerDay)* Numberofdaystaken    ((sumofthedistanceswalkedonmondaysandtuesdays)) /((numbormorowstakeawayovereachhour)); or equivalently      Dividing summaptodistancetravelled:(noberomornestakeawayovernumbersofhours)+       multiplyingtheproductoftotaldistancetravelledpermorningwithafactoredvalueofoneoutofaquadrice     Or simply dividing totaldistance traversedforweeksherequals:[Distransferredanually]+([nmultionormalytimesdividedbywhentheremornexisted]([(twomonthstraveledgewalkaftereachperiod)(sixmonthslastraveededaily])togetohundredfortyonedigitsinthenumericsystem)),               ([sumallamountseachindividualhasmadeviaactivitythatcontributesintoathirddimensionalmetricunitmeasurement]);                        Note :            We cannot say definitively unless asked about specific distances within week duration whether either morning or afternoon individual contribution may exceed half its respective whole figure .
