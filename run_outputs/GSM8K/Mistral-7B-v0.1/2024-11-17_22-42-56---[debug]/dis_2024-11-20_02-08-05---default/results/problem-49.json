Therefore if we subtract these housings off what remains as empty houses equal to sixty eight minus forty it results ninety negative eighteen but since no person can occupy negatives just eliminate them thus the result becomes zero or nothing because any whole positive quantity when less than another cannot also take away anything therefore leaving none behind..
