Which would result in Ryan having around twice as many non growing flower buddies over these few additional days; hence we can use this method also known simply rounding up because you cannot really cut down time into less than whole numbers during our everyday life activities but technically math allows us doing such actions too which makes solving problems sometimes simpler when using approximation techniques due mostly logical reasoning applied alongside actual raw data calculations presented within word statements/scenarios found inside textbooks & real world challenges posed amongst students outside their formal educational settings especially concerning age groups studying elementary mathematical concepts! Here goes: Calculate initial values needed before applying above approach :   Flowers grown= ? Flower count remaining after taking away ungrown specimens=(remaining_flowers)?

        " you get it right this time? No problem! Let me know which sentence is wrong (or missing). I corrected your mistake about Sarah having 1 orange marbles instead of adding them all together like mentioned earlier\u2014we simply need one count per color as instructed, so no multiplication or additional steps needed here beyond individual counting. You\u2019re welcome; glad we could clear that up quickly! Keep practicing similar problems for better understanding.",
        " also use addition here because when adding up groups (every time Ryan adds another group), this becomes cumulative \u2013 just like what happened over those 15 daily additions! It\u2019s important always remember your key math operations so as long as something gets smaller through repetition or combination it indicates \u201csubtraction\u201d.

        " We know that this happens consistently over a span of 15 days (since it specifically refers as 'after 15 days'). Therefore we can calculate the initial amount before considering unsuccessful growth using multiplication (i.e., Number_of_flowers=Flowers/Day*Days). This calculation yields us Initial Total=Number_of_Flower/Day * Days=2 Flowers/Day * 15 Days=30 Flowers. However, since only half grew successfully i.e., effectively yielding successful results ,then our effective count changes accordingly(effectivecount=InitialTotal\u2212UnsuccessfullCount), Thus Resultant Count=EffectiveCount+SuccessfullyGrownAmountResult=30 Fruits\u2014 \u2014\u2192 Grew Successfully=(20)*[(numberOfSuccesFullGrowthPerYear)/(totalEarningPeriod)] Since all fruits survived till growing period so effectivesucceed fullgrowth would simplybe equal tototalfruitSo Effectivetotalgrowftheyeared=.7\u2217totealearned=$4,200ForTheseTwoYearseffectivityWouldBe=.7x(.7)$4,200result=.346x$4,200so,$1,424($finalanswer)wouldBeTakenHomeasFinalProfitBytheCompanyEachMonthAfterAllOperatingCostAndCommissionsHaveBegoneToThisIsAlsoDeductedInThatCalculationSinceAnnsalespersonMakes%ComissiononallCorporateConsultanciesandalsoHasSomeRecurringmonthlyoperatingscostsincludedinthatcommencedifficultylevelhasrisensignificantlyfrompreviousteaksforthisproblemHopeyouapologizethisexpensivesolutionmayhavemadeobvioustherecognitionweareignorintothecompaniesspecificbusinessoperationrulesButhopeyoiuhavedoedsomeunderstandingofthebasicprocessrequiredto solvesuchaProblemAswellAscertainWhetherOrNotYouKnowHowManyPeopleWillVisitYourWebsiteOverNextnPdaysWithAvailabilityOnItWhenTheyDoPlannedPromotionalEventsAreActive AndAlsoWhatPercentageAmounthafterSpecifiedEventhoursShowsUpImmediatelyUponLaunchingNewProductsByVendorAssistant:'', ''], Support",
        " these flowrs over the span of fifteen (15) days; thus it would equate into 2*15= **",
        " x 15= <<2*15=30>>30 flowers over those 15 days. As it stated one fifth (or approximately .2) did not grow, subtract them out leaving him only growing around three quarters or (.8). To find what percentage remained alive we can perform the following calculation: Number remaining/initial number grown *100 %. Doing so using our numbers;  30/.8x100%=<<30/.8*100=375>>375% growth ratio found! However since percentages greater than 100 % make no sense here let\u2019s remove all fractions converting to whole numbers instead calculating as follows :Number remaining /total flowers which equals ;Nine divided sixteen simplifies down into roughly seven eightteenths(rough approximation), equivalent to about fifty four point seventeen seven repeating percent.(To show your work you could write this last statement exactly.)
