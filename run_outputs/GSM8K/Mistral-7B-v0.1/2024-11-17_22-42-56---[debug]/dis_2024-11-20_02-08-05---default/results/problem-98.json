To find these initial drivers we need subtract both numbers which later came forward during normal driving from original count i.e., initially driven away all those amounting into only the ones who managed themselves as well. Therefore our equation becomes [Initial_cars-(Next_batch+Extra)]=Driven within First Minute Period or; Initial[All] = Driven [(OnlyFirstMin)+(SecondBatch) ]+Exited[(Extra Only)] . Substituting known variables thus , yields :  30=(x+(20))+5 therefore yield resultant being ; X=[Total Car Count minus Second Batch plus Extra Cars Exit Taken]=30-(20+5)=X=5 Cars Drive Through Traffic Jam From Original Lineup Within Its Sequence Timeframe Of 15 Mins Given That Also We Know An Additional Group Was Identified Which Managed Their Own Routes Upon Arrival Thus Not Requiring Any Delays While Waiting At Or Thru This Snarl Up Eventuality Hence With These Conditions Stated And Solved As Formulated Our ",
        " without any exits made during this time period (i.e., no one who doesn\u2019t need to), we can assume these are all vehicles that went directly into the flowing traffic again because they didn\u2019t get stuck like others initially faced. However, since half as many cars took off before facing congestion \u2014 specifically around 5 according to data provided \u2013 it implies only about twice fewer than those initial driven-through figures survived until complete resolution via both phases. As such, roughly three quarters equal approximately ~22 or lesser drivers cleared out over the course spanning twenty minutes duration herein discussed; leaving us estimating close vicinity but lower value underneath said figure owing consideration being paid towards partial dischargement occurrences encountered midpoint proceedings relative prior passage transitions noted within our dialogue thread surrounding mentioned event specificities listed alongside associated details presented thereby contextually linking further narrative content elements correlated respectiveively relational/causal connectivity implications resulting subsequent derivations derived accordingly postulated per predicatively forecasted analytical evaluative methodologies employed upon empirically corroborable documented evidence retrieved systematically harvested henceforth implemented whilst concurrently pursued utilising rigorously established procedurally defined verifiable research protocol(s) conducted contemporaneously operationalised adherent thereto prevalently recognized customary theoretical frameworks accepted broadly acknowledged academic paradigms upheld globally sanctioned universally validity maintained conformably standard regulations abiding generally enforced internationally accredited disciplines institutionally ratified officially recognised credentialled scholarship otherwise categorically known throughout entire human race encompasses worldwide expanse inclusive totality comprehensive scope collective global extent essentially interconnected holistically integrated wholesomely harmoniously unanimously indivisibly integral cohesively synergistically mutually supportively reciprocally beneficial progressively continuously dynamically constantly evolving perpetually adapting iteratively optimizing incrementally maximizing efficiently productively effectively proficiently expertly masterfully adeptly exceptionally highly skilled intensely enthusiastically wholeheartedly thoroughly genuinely sincerely authentic legitimately rightfully completely accurately perfectly precise exactly factual definitely certain beyond doubt conclusively confirmed absolutely surely indeed actually sure certainly truly reliably consistently dependably assured unequivocally undoubted irrefutably firmly solidly stoutly resol",

Once you know this combined value subtract it against the initial count before anyone took or joined the back of queue.
