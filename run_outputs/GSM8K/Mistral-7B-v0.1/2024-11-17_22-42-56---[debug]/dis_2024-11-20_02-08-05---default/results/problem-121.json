It won\u2019t affect since this problem deals mainly with simple addition rather multiplication/division based operations typically involved in doubling situations like these\u2014which aren't necessary according to provided information requirements anyway! But still doing calculations might provide better understanding: Firstly finding out 'twice the apple count', i.e., Double(Five Apples)= Two times Fifty=(2)(5).

Therefore Total Sum Fruit Consumed By Both Comprising TwentySeven ElevenTenNinetyOneThreeTwelve Nineteen Equaling One Hundred Ten Units All Together ",
        " Since Kael only brings doubled quantity (but not all types) we cannot just multiply it directly; instead, let us calculate separately as if these quantities belong together because multiplying apple count would make logical sense but doubling orange doesn\u2019t align contextually. Thus according to this logic Kael brought 5*2=10 apples. As per question statement mentioned about taking 'half the actual number', considering even though generally when saying 'double amounts' means multiplication whereas mentioning exactly say 'twice times something else like here twice their numbers of Oranges' implies addition/subtraction kind operation which isn't explicitly clear therefore proceed based on standard assumption i.e., what was said applies equally to any part meaning since I am assuming \u2018halving them meant halving every item individually regardless other statements'. This makes kael bringing him half the individual items namely  8*(1/2)=4 oranges hence making overall contribution equal to   10apples+4orange=14fruit.

And finally adding both collections we get ((13)+((2)(13))=(13+26)), hence taking out all together it equals (49), making use of my basic addition operation properties .That means; if you combine their efforts collectively they can manage about (49) different fruit selections/choices..! That makes perfect sense when seen through math logic perspective.(Final ",
        " That makes it (5+8) which equals 13 fruits. Since Kael brings double what Morisette carried apple wise means (2x5=10), plus since he carries only half as numerous orangewise compared to morisettes original count we get .(1/2)(8)=4 so adding this up kael carried ((10)+(4))or equivalently,(10+4). This totals out into (14) fruit items altogether being their collective contribution together when summed cumulatively.(Note though both carry distinct individual counts these can also be tallied under one umbrella.) An alternative way might just keep track piecewise separately instead like:(Morrisees Apples+(Kaelines Oranges)). Another approach may be taking care not make too big jumps but staying sequentially ordered; thus you add first Moires Apple quantity((Morrisees_Apple))to whatever kael delivers him subsequently via ((MoiraeusOranges)/2),(then next time round combine Morrisees initial Orange quotient againwith still remaining quota within said halved value due finally upon reaching complete summation over stated amounts held individually respectivelyfor those involvedtherefore making equation look something along such linesif using same abbreviation schemeas follows ,we could use symbols & terms herein : mam:=morisedapple,maom:= moiredorisetc,.kamp:=kaelinsapplegtc=.ktc:=kaelingorange ctpd:=fruittotaldirectlyfromcombinedcollectionsofthembothmammptkcqtpcntpctpd=&nbsp;&nbsp;; ;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;the above serves well enough demonstrative purposeseven if perhaps verbosebut overall ideaconcept stays intactand all valuesare derivedcorrectlywithout lossnonegainederroraccrualresultvaluescould simply expressitallmore succinctwayfollowlittlerulespreferredorderwhile keeping detailsnearhandclearonproblemstatementsoo::mamtk&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &=          (=                           ()       )              ||     |               /      \\            __|_________\\    _|        \\\\/_ /\\n\\nmattkeithsontainmentagencycompanyspecializesinconsolidatedmediaproductionventralighttelevisionfilmsthroughvariouschannelsoutletsevenprimetimenetworksh",
