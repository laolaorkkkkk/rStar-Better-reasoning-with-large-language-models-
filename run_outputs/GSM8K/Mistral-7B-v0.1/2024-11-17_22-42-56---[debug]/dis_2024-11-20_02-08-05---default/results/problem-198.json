From this summed amount of all previously possessed pocket Monster cards (first and initial), we can calculate card quantities received during both additional time periods mentioned within respective paragraph segments as follows; Firstly when describing collecting items from said period under consideration, it states 'she collected twenty less'. Hence she garnered another batch totalling up to six poke monsters minus twenty which translates into forty eight (. i.e.,  60 \u2013 20 ) . Subsequently , following further elaboration surrounding similar subject matter found elsewhere around same piece of writing material ; specifically regarding accrual over ensuing interlude , such accumulations experienced doubling their numerical aggregate thus representing doubled numbers calculated above or one thousand ninety four (   1x(80 [summated quantity ] + 48[quantity newly gathered] (=    128) *two).

To find out the sumtotal amount of all these values we would add together these four amounts resulting into this equation \u2211[initial+(three*times)+((two*(fourth+second)))] being equaling  \u2794 20+300+200 , making our solution equal to 520 .
