        " 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 inches (since one foot equals ten inches). The size of each small section obtained when cutting up this wire would need to be converted into units compatible with our previous calculation. Since we calculated earlier that Tracy chopped off sections which measure six inches per unit, divide the longer line segment\u2019s measurement into shorter ones using these calculations; thus resulting from those evaluations as follows:  48 / 6 = <<48/6=8>>8 smaller segments or 'pieces'.

        " one foot. This makes it (4*12) which equals 48 inches. Each section consists of 6 inches so divide 48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces . That means Tracy obtained eight pieces.. ",
        " total inches (in) / desired unit size which you want per section; Here we divide by six so this results into . To find out whole numbers only calculate floor division ,floor(48/6). This equals 8 segments obtained. The answer is: 8.",
        " / 6 = 8 so Tracy obtained eight segments when dividing up this initial piece of steel cable. "
