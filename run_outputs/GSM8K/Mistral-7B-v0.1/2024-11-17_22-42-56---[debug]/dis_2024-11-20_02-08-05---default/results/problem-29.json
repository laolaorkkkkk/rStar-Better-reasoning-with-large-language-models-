But this combined value exceeds gloria\u2019s boot purchase range because fourteen plus eleven equals forty eight . All things considered these values don\u0092t help determine our target variable so let us drop them out instead focus solely upon what we know about Boots which tells us B represents the amount of cash available for buying new foot wear or higher priced items like boat while having both those options expenses hover below fifteen thousand seven hundred fifty cent signifying twelve ninety seventy(12)(970),sixty million nine hundred ninety one zero milliards(6,091),thousand sevenscore dozen tens (12,740)$ but not above ((1)*eleven+((2))*two=*)five$(2+(11)=)fifteen$.

As such $$(66)-10=$____ .

To find the maximum possible selling price (i.e., what the expensive pair) within limits means first deduct initial prices altogether ($99), leaving you empty/zero space to play around without making things smaller thus increasing disparity towards being overpriced hence confirming our approach correctness leading straight forward calculation using simple arithmetic i.e.; Boots Price \u2013 Total HighHeelsPrice$ = DifferenceToAddBack($99-$5=$94).

As mentioned previously, assuming equal distribution implies even division; however, since only forty percent corresponds precisely\u2014it can infer partial allocation within fractions.

        " dollars. Together, both pairs cost 33 + 66 = 99 dollars. Since these amount totals to 5 dollars less than the boots Gloria wants to buy, we add this difference to get the price of the boots. Therefore, it means the boots cost 99 + 5 = 104 dollars. The answer is: 104.",
        " 5 dollars more than this combined price so Gloria needs to find out what (99+5) equals. That sum would be your solution plus extra cash you need or it could represent just solving glorias situation without additional monetary amount needed. Subsequently subtracting these values we get; Boots= 104$ but because those aren't our answers here yet let us go back into another round of math breakdown focusing on finding real value rather adding unnecessary information based upon question prompt itself(in short stick strictly related numerical analysis). Here instead consider first calculating actual spending power excluding both items entirely \u2013 using basic subtraction only leaving untouched original allocation provided initially within problem statement i.e., not considering any prices quoted directly during description portion thus enabling precise resultant calculation yield correspondingly correct decision making potential according specific scenario context shared above concerning purchase options presented under consideration whilst adhering closely aligned factual accuracy essential component determining credible output resolution process application ensuring desired accurate conclusive outcome delivery align perfectly fitting purpose defined goal fulfillment successfully achieving task set forth specifically demanding exactitude crucial factor influencing ultimately satisfactory understanding achieved pertaining involved activities execution proceedings leading toward comprehensively resolving initial intricate issue raised query necessitating attentive detail focused investigative endeavours applied methodically through carefully structured detailed reasoning sequencing followed rigorous logical analytical evaluation steps resulting validated results reflect genuine intentions accurately mirror true reality thereby uphold foundational principles integrity maintain professional commitment quality assurance guarantees best practice implementations consistently observed throughout thoroughness driven pursuits always aim deliver utmost beneficial advice practical wisdom insightful guidance facilitative support empower client growth accomplish goals efficiently effectively lever advantageous opportunity optimize resource optimal utilization harness fullest extent possibles synergistic maximized collective effort capitalize mutually advantageous partnerships fostering cooperative relationship strengthened trust built solid foundation progress steadily enhance competitive edge ensure sustainable successful enterprise operation long term prosperity assured success guaranteed achievements accomplished!",
        " dollars; so the boots cost 99 + 5= dollar(s) (the amount glory spends on both dresses minus those extra seven). Gloria\u2019s favorite color happened to be orange but only liked pink earrings because green made her sneeze badly\u2026and while this didn't determine their prices it certainly determined what colors you could see inside the store! To recap our math story \u2013 since we know everything about your character except perhaps why someone might pick red over black...it makes perfect sense if we consider things like fashion trends vs personal preference along every element mentioned here including fabric types such silk versus polyester materials etc.. But remember everyone has different priorities hence these kinds deal decisions come up very often indeed regardless whether items appear cheap enough compared another option even sometimes just plain old common sense matters too . That means anything goes really until finally arriving back home full happy smile satisfied feeling having received goodies worth far greater value still despite higher price tags present initially!!!!!",
