        " all possible rational roots (zeros) of the polynomial f(x). Let us first apply Rational Root Theorem.

Once you identify candidate zeros/roots use synthetic division or factoring methods such as difference of cubes, sum of squares etc.. Repeat this process until no quotients remain. Explanation First let me correct what I wrote above it looks like your understanding about theorem may not entirely right . You can find root according following steps ; We know $(a\u2212b)(ax+b)=\u200ba^2\u00d7x^2)+ab\u2212ax^2=ax(b)-ba$$\\\\ $$\u21d2 b=-ka / ax^{2}\u200b)$ ,so every potential solution equals $-qa/\u2009x^{2}$.

First calculate the sum as below;   Number Of Teachers*Number Of Cleanings Per Lession=Total No.Of Times It Is Used(Or Taken Care) By All Student When They Take Turn . Total nooftimesitisusedortakencareduringthatturn=(No.offeed)*(Numbneroftimesperlesson)=4*(3)(2),which results into (4)(6)=24 And since we know every time any one student took care or used this resource during their teaching period its counted only once despite them sharing not having multiple counts within same interval thus resultant count remains unchanged i.e.,totalnoftimeitsuseddureachingtheperiodiclysharingstudentsonetakethetroneventuredinturn=.Thus ",
        " times all four use it together (since these actions happen concurrently)\u2014the result would mean that every time one teacher finishes their turn; another begins immediately taking its place up until both activities cease due to school hours being over or other limits such as maintenance schedules etc.. However based solely off information provided here we can state simply since no specific timing was mentioned beyond 'each', this implies equal usage across group thus requiring only division among groups involved making basic math calculations possible without considering overlap periods amongst multiple classes within same hour windows\u2026 Hence combining our findings results into Calculation equals (Whiteboard_cleanings \u00d7 Teachers), hence 6(Times Per Day/Teacher)\u00d7 Number Of Full Use Cycles Throughout Work Period Equal=Calculate Whiteboard Cleanups! ",
        " times the whiteboard was used during all four classes in one working day (as we know every time when any teacher comes into use it requires another round), so 4(teachers) \u00d7 2(lessons/teacher per workday)= 8 rounds of usage within a single workday. Since this whiteboard undergoes its required maintenance procedure thrice following these eight occasions; hence calculate likewise i.e., multiply by 'x', or 3\u00d7 8=24 . Finally determine out the overall count upon which our inquiry pivots around\u2014the quantity ascertained being precisely \u2018total\u2019 means summing up individual contributions throughout those periods without account duplication resulting herein would amount thereby directly reaching the solution represented plaintextually thus concluded numerically signifying succinctness ensuring precision through mathematical clarity inherently intrinsic qualities associated invariably attributed towards quantitative computations facilitated via numerical analysis principles universally applicable across educational settings inclusively spanning K-12 school institutions promoting analytical problem solving dexterity cultivated progressive pedagogy aligned conceptual understanding fostering learning environments optimized maximizing scholastic success metrics holistically encompassing cognitive faculties equally academic achievement trajectories perpetuating knowledge transmission paradigms effectively catalyzing intellectual growth progression lifelong learning ideation embracing dynamic interactive instructional methodologies encouraging learner autonomy championing active engagement driving curriculum infusion strategic reformulation incorporating technology integration leveraging digital literacy skill set development nurturing creative critical thinking skills empowerment mindset transformation motivational factors fuel propelling inspiring change advocate innovative education practices shaping future leaders optimizing societal benefits amplifying community uplift initiatives broaden scope sustainable global impact elevating quality standards worldwide commemoratively reinforcing excellence benchmark setting precedent advancing universal human potential realization beyond borders transcending cultural boundaries ultimately contributing substantively positively influencing planetary stewardship responsibility tenets aligning core values ethos interconnected globally resonant harmoniously reflecting collective conscious unity diversity collaboration cooperation respect dignity mutual prosperous partnership peaceful international relations justice equity fair play solidarity support refuge open dialogue exchange idea sharing constructive criticism healthy debate rational discourse thought provoking question answering insight synthesis coherence comprehension integrative approach cross disciplinary connections"
