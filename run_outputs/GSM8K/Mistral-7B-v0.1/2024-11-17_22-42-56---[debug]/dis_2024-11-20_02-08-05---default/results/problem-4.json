To figure out whether this meets or exceeds the daily requirement per chicken we divide it into the requirements mentioned earlier \u2013 one cup gets served thrice /mealtime/, therefore every single bird receives : 1*3=3 units(cups). All together the above calculation tells us about servings required according to all birds which means multiplying current result obtained thus far i.e., total amount needed divided by consumable content unit; here ,unit stands being 'cup'.

        " means so far she has given out 15 + 25 = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed. Since each chicken gets fed thrice daily (morning, afternoon, evening), we divide this amount equally among all six meals across which it totals up as follows;  40 divided by six equals approximately 6.67 cups per single portion. However, since chickens cannot consume fractions of food portions or partial amounts accurately, rounding off results may not reflect actual intake quantities during varying periods. Hence, presuming optimal circumstances without any variation concerning individual bird consumption rates, every one part equivalent around sevenfold represents approximate equal allocation amongst different times within a specified period under identical dietary conditions based upon rounded figures approximated using common divisibility rules applied to determine fraction equivalencies regarding whole numbers derived through integer division calculations involving arithmetic operations conducted via standard principles incorporated into elementary mathematical methods utilized widely accepted primarily due its widespread recognition facilitated dissemination promoting educational methodologies emphasizing conceptual understanding versus mere procedural application focusing fundamentally towards fostering practical applicability thereby enabling learners achieve proficiency demonstrating competency essential contributing effectively impactful societal roles fulfillment achieving collective wellbeing progress sustainable development optimizing overall quality life enhancement ensuring universal access inclusivity equity human rights dignity peace harmony cooperation international collaboration global governance reform strengthened multilateralism democratic diplomacy dialogue partnership relations mutually beneficial interests respect diverse cultural background traditions values shared commitments responsibilities accountability transparency integrity good governance efficient management effective leadership innovation creativity critical thinking problem solving adaptability flexibility resilience determination tenacity resourcefulness collaborative effort teamwork solidarity unity diversity plurality tolerance acceptance constructively engaging varied perspectives embracing differences learning experiences growth opportunities expand knowledge skills build capacity empower communities enable transformational change drive positive momentum catalyze social justice advance equality economic prosperity mitigate challenges address root causes systemically tackle interrelated issues comprehensive approach ensure holistic solution implement best practices share lessons learned promote continuous improvement strive constantly improve standards benchmark exemplars models replicate successful initiatives transfer credible expertise leverage experience optimize potential unlock hidden gems realize full benefit harness maximum outcome deliver tangible result demonstrate",

To calculate explicitly though using numbers means dividing equally among n units which would result simply into splitting both figures above evenly amongst our group \u2013 so let us divide through likewise assuming unitary consumption patterns : taking away third fractions results leaving precisely half remaining . But remember ,there aren\u2019t necessarily 'half hours,' only ratios matter when calculating overall usage rates!

As such, considering she owns twenty hens(chickens), we can calculate the quantity required using multiplication which results as follows;  20*(9)= 180cups over the whole period. Considering what was already given i.e., (40); We subtract this value to find out exactly how much food ought to still get provided. That totals up to 180-(40) therefore equals into ((180)-(40)) which translates into getting equal amount of around 140 units remaining to distribute among all these chickens until the time when dinner happens..

Since Wendi only feeds one cup to every single chicken (because it doesn't specify otherwise), this means out of those 40 cups, each bird received exactly once halfway through the day because there are twice as many birds again during noon than early or late evenings. Therefore we can divide these totals equally across any division of timeframe i.e., over the whole day or into breakfast/lunch dinner etcetera but since here specific divisions mentioned not applicable so assuming equal amount daily distribution; hence ,total needed for resting period(after first serving) = Total Cups Per Chicken \u2013 Morning Feeding = Daily Amount-(Morning Food Given).

However, this means it\u2019s not possible since you can't split one cup into smaller parts like .125 without using fraction measurements). We correct our calculations considering whole numbers only so we assume here that when needed Wendi splits up any excess amount among multiple portions instead of breaking it down further; thus making actual daily consumption as follows: Morning intake would still equal 1.5 cups/chicken(rounded up); Afternoon also remains equivalent regardless whether measured out accurately or rounded off hence calculated similarly yielding 1.5 too based on condition ",

This means that up until currently provides sufficient nutrition (one cup).

However it doesn't make sense ,so I take floor here,Wendi\u2019ll throw away approximately one cup, thus leaving just about fifteen plus twenty minus approximate threeteen eight. As you see both calculations lead up almost same result : **16** It means Wendi would likely buy only twelve extra . But since none but whole numbers count when counting items like cats--if buying anything less than required still fails---we round our previous calculation downward again! When rounded further using integer division (**floor function*** /****math.floorfreeze/***)to avoid fractions what ever remains gets disregarded ;thus...our solution becomes ***Nine***!!
