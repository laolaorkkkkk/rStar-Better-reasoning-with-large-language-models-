        " know Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday which took 5*4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours. Similarly, when she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday it would take around 7*4 =<<7*4=28>>28 hours; this also means time taken up was doubled because all articles required same effort level(time). Hence if written 7 articles she needs ~28 hours instead of needed based on single standard rate i.e., half compared previous calculation period ie., expected just one extra hour but not another eight since writer might increase productivity or improve efficiency over continuous task durations. This suggests possibility maybe through improved concentration post daily commitment fulfilled without any noticeable performance degradation thus increasing overall working speed beyond initial expectation value correspondingly leading into lower duration requirement despite higher output volume resulting directly towards reduced individual input overhead due elevated capacity utilization ratio consequent onto high frequency interaction scenario prevailing under constant routine operational mode facilitated via enhanced situational awareness coupled mutual familiarity among participating parties engenderedly inducing favorable cognitive stimulus environment promoting sustained attentive focus hence optimal execution capability while maintaining effective communication flow across team dynamics contributing concurrent positive feedback loop reinforcement mechanism ultimately culminating beneficial cumulative effect within target area pertaining primary objective achievement process specifically associated wtih goal completion timelines regarding said project scope parameters outlined hereinabove thereby minimizing potential risks stemming possible resource shortages otherwise faced during implementation phase subsequently impairing intended deliverables\u2019 successful realization probability causing delays affecting stakeholders satisfaction levels amongst involved entities alike therefore mitigating adverse impact accordingly ensuring smooth transition throughout entire lifecycle life cycle stages covering design conception planning documentation approval verification testing validation certifying confirmation authorization issuance dissemination followups tracking progress monitoring subsequent reporting review evaluative analysis drawing conclusions summarizations consensus building discussions deliberations decisions agreements negotiation procedures dispute resolution mechanisms etcetera till closing conclusion closure event commemorating celebrations appreciating efforts contributed wholeheartedly everyone included sharing joyous moments together bond strengthening collectively uplifting mood positively influencing morale boosting spirits furthermore gratitude expressed sincere thanks acknowledged heartfelt recognition deserved well earned respect afforded appreciated honored cherished memories valued contributions made lasting legacy",

Add these together \u2013 all you get is a sum of 5(from Mon) + 7(Tue) + 14(Wed), resulting into altogether being equal to 5+7+14 or 26articles over the period of three days.
