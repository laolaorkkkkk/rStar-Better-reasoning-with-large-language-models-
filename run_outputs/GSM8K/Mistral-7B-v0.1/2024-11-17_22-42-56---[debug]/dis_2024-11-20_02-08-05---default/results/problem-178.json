        " Since it says Monic has 4 lesser than Bo this means M=B\u20134 so if B=40 (Bo\u2019s amount) ,then monic would have(40 \u2013 4)=M; Therefore Monic C=36 because it doesn\u2019t say whether bo was referring only male or both types . Finally since Rani gets mentioned as having just one type which seems common enough based off other examples thus far ; let us assume it also refers specifically to female : rani gets said here as getting exactly ten males more than all others totalling up therefore F+T,(Females)+N+Y.(Neutral/other forms including Y.)=(Monica+bo):This becomes:(D+(E))=(monica+bo);now substituting these values known((d+e)+b)(or D+E+B)->We know E equals T plus either N or Y depending upon preference not clear yet but nevertheless still irrelevant until further information arrives..so without knowing what species makeup goes into \u201cC\u201d category\u2026but adding them anyway makes everything come out evenly no matter!

        " crab than Bo (who has 40), we can say that Monic also has as many as Bo minus four or y=40-4 which equals to 36, so our previous equation turns out into being X+10=y. Replacing Y with its known amount it would turn up like this; x+10=36-->X=36\u221210\u2192x=26 ,so monic actually gets 26 crabs(as figured previously). Summing all those quantities leads us back again having just calculated them; thus combined total becomes Bo\u2019s original count plus what you get when adding everything else apart form boes initial quantity ; i .e.: Sumbation Total<=>BoCrabQty+(Moniac)+Rani",
